<hr>

<p class="poem">
  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
  "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Only this and nothing more."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
  Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
  From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Nameless here for evermore.</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
  Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
  "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
  Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   This it is and nothing more."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
  "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
  That I scarce was sure I heard you"—here I opened wide the door—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Darkness there and nothing more.</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br>
  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"<br>
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Merely this and nothing more.</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
  Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br>
  "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
  Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore—<br>
  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   'Tis the wind and nothing more.</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>
  Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,<br>
  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
  "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
  Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>
  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   With such name as "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br>
  That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour<br>
  Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered—<br>
  Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before—<br>
  On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Then the bird said "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
  "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>
  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Of 'Never—nevermore.'"</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>
  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br>
  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>
  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br>
  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   <i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
  "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
  Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
  Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>
  On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>
  Is there—<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
  By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>
  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  "Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting—<br>
  "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!<br>
  Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>
  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p><br>

<p class="poem">
  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming<br>
  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;<br>
  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span><br>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
