   <p>
I WAS sick — sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at
length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were
leaving me. The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the
last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound
of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.
It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution—perhaps from its
association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief
period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with
how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.
They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet upon which I trace
these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity
of their expression of firmness—of immoveable resolution—of
stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was
Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly
locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered
because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious
horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies
which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon
the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of
charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then,
all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt
every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic
battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of
flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there
stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet
rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily,
and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my
spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of
the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles
sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of
darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing
descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night were
the universe.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.
What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to
describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber—no! In
delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in the
grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from
the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.
Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember
not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are
two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly,
that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon
reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first,
we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.
And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows
from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the
first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they
not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never
swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in
coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions
that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some
novel flower—is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning
of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles
to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my
soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success;
there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up
remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have
had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These
shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore
me in silence down—down—still down—till a hideous
dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the
descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that
heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness
throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had
outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the
wearisomeness of their toil. After this I call to mind flatness and
dampness; and then all is madness—the madness of a memory which
busies itself among forbidden things.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound—the
tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating.
Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and
touch—a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere
consciousness of existence, without thought—a condition which lasted
long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest
endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into
insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to
move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable
draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire
forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much
earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.
   </p><br>
   <p>
So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound.
I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.
There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine
where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I
dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to
look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be
nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly
unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness
of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of
the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was
intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my
reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted
from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and
it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet
not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition,
notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with
real existence;—but where and in what state was I? The condemned to
death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had
been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to
my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for
many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in
immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells
at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.
   </p><br>
   <p>
A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and
for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon
recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every
fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I
felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the
walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big
beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable,
and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes
straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of
light. I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and
vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at
least, the most hideous of fates.
   </p><br>
   <p>
And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came
thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of
Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated—fables
I had always deemed them—but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat,
save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean
world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?
That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary
bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode
and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.
   </p><br>
   <p>
My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was
a wall, seemingly of stone masonry—very smooth, slimy, and cold. I
followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain
antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no
means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its
circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of
the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the
knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial
chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of
coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of
the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty,
nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it
seemed at first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and
placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In
groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag
upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted
upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was
moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and
fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon
overtook me as I lay.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a
pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this
circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed
my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the
fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted
fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight
more;—when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred
paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be
fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall,
and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I
could not help supposing it to be.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I had little object—certainly no hope—in these researches; but
a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I
resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with
extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was
treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not
hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as
possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the
remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I
stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.
   </p><br>
   <p>
In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a
somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,
and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this—my
chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper
portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin,
touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy
vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I
put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very
brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of
ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just below the
margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into
the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed
against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a
sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment
there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a
door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the
gloom, and as suddenly faded away.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated
myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step
before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just
avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and
frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its
tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,
or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for the
latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at
the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting
subject for the species of torture which awaited me.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving there
to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my
imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon. In
other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once
by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of
cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits—that
the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I
again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and
a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel
at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before
I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me—a sleep like
that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once
again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild
sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I
was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.
   </p><br>
   <p>
In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls
did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me
a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less
importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the
mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in
trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had
committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my
first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the
period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the
fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the
vault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps—thus
supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My confusion of
mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the
left, and ended it with the wall to the right.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In
feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great
irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing
from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight
depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison
was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some
other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the
depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely
daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel
superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects
of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images,
overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these
monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded
and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed
the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned the circular pit
from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.
   </p><br>
   <p>
All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal condition
had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at
full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this I was securely
bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in many
convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and
my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply
myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I
saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my horror;
for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it appeared to be
the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was
meat pungently seasoned.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or
forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its
panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the
painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu
of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the
pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There
was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me
to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it (for
its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in
motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was
brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in
fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull
movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.
   </p><br>
   <p>
A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw
several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which
lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they came up
in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the
meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.
   </p><br>
   <p>
It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take
but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I
then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased
in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was
also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had
perceptibly descended. I now observed—with what horror it is
needless to say—that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent
of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns
upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a
razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid
and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and
the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in
torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial
agents—the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a
recusant as myself—the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor
as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I
had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or
entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the
grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no
part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no
alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I
half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.
   </p><br>
   <p>
What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal,
during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch by inch—line
by line—with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed
ages—down and still down it came! Days passed—it might have
been that many days passed—ere it swept so closely over me as to fan
me with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into
my nostrils. I prayed—I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more
speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself
upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly
calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare
bauble.
   </p><br>
   <p>
There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon
again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the
pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who
took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at
pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very—oh, inexpressibly sick
and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that
period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched
my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small
remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion of it
within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy—of
hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a half formed
thought—man has many such which are never completed. I felt that it
was of joy—of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its
formation. In vain I struggled to perfect—to regain it. Long
suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an
imbecile—an idiot.
   </p><br>
   <p>
The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw that
the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It would fray
the serge of my robe—it would return and repeat its operations—again—and
again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more)
and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very
walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several
minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I paused. I dared not go
farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of
attention—as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of
the steel. I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it
should pass across the garment—upon the peculiar thrilling sensation
which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all
this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Down—steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in
contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right—to
the left—far and wide—with the shriek of a damned spirit; to
my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and
howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Down—certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches
of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This
was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from
the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.
Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized
and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to
arrest an avalanche!
   </p><br>
   <p>
Down—still unceasingly—still inevitably down! I gasped and
struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My
eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,
although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! Still I
quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery
would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope
that prompted the nerve to quiver—the frame to shrink. It was hope—the
hope that triumphs on the rack—that whispers to the death-condemned
even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.
   </p><br>
   <p>
I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual
contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over
my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time
during many hours—or perhaps days—I thought. It now occurred
to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I
was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent
athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be
unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that
case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle how
deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not
foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it probable that the
bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my
faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my
head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my
limbs and body close in all directions—save in the path of the
destroying crescent.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there
flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed
half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and
of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I
raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now present—feeble,
scarcely sane, scarcely definite,—but still entire. I proceeded at
once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.
   </p><br>
   <p>
For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I
lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,
ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for
motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. "To what food," I
thought, "have they been accustomed in the well?"
   </p><br>
   <p>
They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a
small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual
see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the
unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their
voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.
With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I
thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my
hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.
   </p><br>
   <p>
At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change—at
the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the
well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their
voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the
boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This
seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in
fresh troops. They clung to the wood—they overran it, and leaped in
hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed
them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the
anointed bandage. They pressed—they swarmed upon me in ever
accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my
own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which
the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy
clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would
be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in
more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human
resolution I lay still.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain. I at
length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had
divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice
again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But
the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers
hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement—cautious,
sidelong, shrinking, and slow—I slid from the embrace of the bandage
and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was
free.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Free!—and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped
from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the
motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some
invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took
desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!—I
had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse
than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously
around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual—some
change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly—it was
obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy
and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected
conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the
origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from
a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the
prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely
separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look
through the aperture.
   </p><br>
   <p>
As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber
broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the
outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the
colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and
were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that
gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have
thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly
vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been
visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could
not force my imagination to regard as unreal.
   </p><br>
   <p>
Unreal!—Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath
of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A
deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A
richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.
I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my
tormentors—oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I shrank
from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the thought of the
fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came
over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining
vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost
recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the
meaning of what I saw. At length it forced—it wrestled its way into
my soul—it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason.—Oh! for
a voice to speak!—oh! horror!—oh! any horror but this! With a
shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands—weeping
bitterly.

The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with
a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell—and
now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that
I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking
place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had
been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying
with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its
iron angles were now acute—two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful
difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an
instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the
alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I
could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal
peace. "Death," I said, "any death but that of the pit!" Fool! might I
have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to
urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its
pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity
that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its
greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back—but
the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length for my seared
and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm
floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found
vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I
tottered upon the brink—I averted my eyes—

There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of
many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The
fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,
fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French army
had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.
