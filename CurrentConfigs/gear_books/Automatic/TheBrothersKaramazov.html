<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son
of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known
in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing
to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago,
and which I shall describe in its proper place. For the present I
will only say that this <span class="tei tei-q">???landowner???</span>???for so we used to call him,
although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate???was a
strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject
and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those
senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their
worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,
for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of
the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on
them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred
thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life
one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district.
I repeat, it was not stupidity???the majority of these fantastical fellows
are shrewd and intelligent enough???but just senselessness, and
a peculiar national form of it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by
his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor
Pavlovitch's first wife, Adela??da Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly
rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district,
the Mi??sovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also
a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span>
common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the
last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all
called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the
last <span class="tei tei-q">???romantic???</span> generation who after some years of an enigmatic
passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married
at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and
ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and
rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished,
entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's
Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers,
had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in
its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place.
This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar
instances in the last two or three generations. Adela??da Ivanovna
Mi??sov's action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's
ideas, and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom.
She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence, to
override class distinctions and the despotism of her family. And a
pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for a brief
moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic position,
was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch,
though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an
elopement, and this greatly captivated Adela??da Ivanovna's fancy.
Fyodor Pavlovitch's position at the time made him specially eager
for any such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a
career in one way or another. To attach himself to a good family
and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love
it did not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite
of Adela??da Ivanovna's beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of
the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a
voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the
slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman
who made no particular appeal to his senses.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immediately after the elopement Adela??da Ivanovna discerned
in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt.
The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with
extraordinary rapidity. Although the family accepted the event
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span>
pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the
husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there
were everlasting scenes between them. It was said that the young
wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor
Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up
to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that
those thousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the
rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his
utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by means of some
deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded, merely
from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from the
contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless
importunity. But, fortunately, Adela??da Ivanovna's family intervened
and circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact
that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but
rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but
was beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed,
impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally,
she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a
destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old,
in her husband's hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced
a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to orgies of
drunkenness. In the intervals he used to drive all over the province,
complaining tearfully to each and all of Adela??da Ivanovna's having
left him, going into details too disgraceful for a husband to
mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to gratify
him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part
of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,???</span> scoffers said
to him. Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part
in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it
funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position.
But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded
in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor woman
turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity
student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete
emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span>
making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could
not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but
having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself
for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just
at that time his wife's family received the news of her death in
Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to
one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and
the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with
joy, raising his hands to Heaven: <span class="tei tei-q">???Lord, now lettest Thou Thy
servant depart in peace,???</span> but others say he wept without restraint
like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in
spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions
were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time
wept for her who released him. As a general rule, people, even the
wicked, are much more na??ve and simple-hearted than we suppose.
And we ourselves are, too.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and
how he would bring up his children. His behavior as a father
was exactly what might be expected. He completely abandoned the
child of his marriage with Adela??da Ivanovna, not from malice,
nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he
forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his tears and
complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful
servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya
into his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been
no one even to change the baby's little shirt.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's
side forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living,
his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was
seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained
for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span>
with him in the servant's cottage. But if his father had remembered
him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his
existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as the child
would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a cousin
of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov, happened to return
from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but
was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the
Mi??sovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture,
who had been in the capitals and abroad. Towards the end of his
life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties.
In the course of his career he had come into contact with
many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and
abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in
his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the
Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had
almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one
of the most grateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent
property of about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old
style. His splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and
bordered on the lands of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr
Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he
came into the estate, concerning the rights of fishing in the river or
wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know exactly which. He regarded
it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an
attack upon the <span class="tei tei-q">???clericals.???</span> Hearing all about Adela??da Ivanovna,
whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time
been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened,
in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He made the latter's acquaintance for the first
time, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child's
education. He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch,
that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked
for some time as though he did not understand what child he was
talking about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he
had a little son in the house. The story may have been exaggerated,
yet it must have been something like the truth.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly
playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span>
so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance,
in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very
great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like
Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business
through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch,
joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and
land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this
cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and
after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at
once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady
living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in
Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of
February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he remembered
all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya
passed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe
he changed his home a fourth time later on. I won't enlarge upon
that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch's
firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts
about him, without which I could not begin my story.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was
the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the
belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on
coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did
not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school,
then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was
degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and
spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any income
from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then
got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for
the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood
on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to
have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made
haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of
money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from
the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact
worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his
father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this,
too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span>
of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with
this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the
young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient,
and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he
would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So
Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending
him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when
four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our
little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out
to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get
an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property
in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even
in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of
his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right
to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man
was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost
beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe,
the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory
story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass
to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other two
sons, and of their origin.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands
Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage
lasted eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also
a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon
some small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though
Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he
never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business
affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-scrupulously.
Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was
left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up
in the house of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span>
who was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not
know the details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a
meek and gentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in
which she was hanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her
sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old
woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an
insufferable tyrant through idleness.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about
him and he was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed
an elopement to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt
that she would not on any account have married him if she had
known a little more about him in time. But she lived in another
province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about it,
except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than
remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child exchanged a
benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a
penny this time, for the general's widow was furious. She gave
them nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on
a dowry; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent
girl, above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar
attraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only
the coarser types of feminine beauty.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,???</span> he used to say
afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this
might, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had
received no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her
<span class="tei tei-q">???from the halter,???</span> he did not stand on ceremony with her. Making
her feel that she had <span class="tei tei-q">???wronged???</span> him, he took advantage of her
phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary
decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women into his
house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife's presence.
To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that
Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who
had always hated his first mistress, Adela??da Ivanovna, took the
side of his new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor
Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion
broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of
the house. In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span>
from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is
most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be <span class="tei tei-q">???possessed
by devils.???</span> At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even
lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan
and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second
three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth
year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother
all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the
same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother,
Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their
father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in
his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who
had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all
those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she
was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya's manner of life,
and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared
aloud two or three times to her retainers:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's
widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she
did a great deal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had
not seen for those eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is
that instantly upon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she
gave him two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a
tuft of hair, and shook him three times up and down. Then, without
a word, she went straight to the cottage to the two boys.
Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty
linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and announcing
that she would carry off both the children she wrapped
them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove
off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted
slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to her
carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,
<span class="tei tei-q">???God would repay her for the orphans.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???You are a blockhead all
the same,???</span> the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good
thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span>
any proposition in regard to his children's education. As for the
slaps she had given him, he drove all over the town telling the story.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left
the boys in her will a thousand roubles each <span class="tei tei-q">???for their instruction,
and so that all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition
that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it
is more than adequate provision for such children. If other people
think fit to throw away their money, let them.???</span> I have not read
the will myself, but I heard there was something queer of the sort,
very whimsically expressed. The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch
Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the province, turned out, however,
to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and
discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for
his children's education (though the latter never directly refused
but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was,
indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a
personal interest in the orphans. He became especially fond of the
younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as one of his family.
I beg the reader to note this from the beginning. And to Yefim
Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met
with, the young people were more indebted for their education and
bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles
left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time they
came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation
of interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly
spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them.
I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth,
but will only mention a few of the most important events. Of the
elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose
and reserved, though far from timid boy. At ten years old he
had realized that they were living not in their own home but on
other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his
infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude
for learning. I don't know precisely why, but he left the
family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering
a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated
teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span>
declare afterwards that this was all due to the <span class="tei tei-q">???ardor for good
works???</span> of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that
the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young
man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As
Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the
tyrannical old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to
two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and
the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the
university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was
studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate
with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for
him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that
from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that
may have been, the young man was by no means despondent and
succeeded in getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and
afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers
under the signature of <span class="tei tei-q">???Eye-Witness.???</span> These paragraphs,
it was said, were so interesting and piquant that they were soon
taken. This alone showed the young man's practical and intellectual
superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of
both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals,
unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for
copying and translations from the French. Having once got into
touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection
with them, and in his latter years at the university he published
brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his
last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a
far wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and
remembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had
just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two
thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more
important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice,
on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing,
as he was a student of natural science. The article dealt with
a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time???the
position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span>
on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was
most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected
conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly
as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even
atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons
opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical
burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article
penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where
the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the
ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning
the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of
the town and the son of <span class="tei tei-q">???that Fyodor Pavlovitch.???</span> And just then
it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking
myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit,
which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never
fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that
a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious,
should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had
ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him,
and would not under any circumstances have given him money,
though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying
in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two
months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact
was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me.
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov, of whom we have spoken already,
the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the
neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from
Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was
more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the
young man, who interested him extremely, and with whom he
sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself
in acquirements.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is proud,???</span> he used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">???he will never be in want of pence;
he has got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want
here? Every one can see that he hasn't come for money, for his
father would never give him any. He has no taste for drink and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span>
dissipation, and yet his father can't do without him. They get on
so well together!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence
over his father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently
and even seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often
extremely and even spitefully perverse.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at
the request of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri,
whom he saw for the first time on this very visit, though he had
before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him about an
important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself. What
that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even
when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan
Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather
mysterious.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a
mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was
in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action
against him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some
of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger
brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been
the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find
it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give
some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact,
which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing
the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year in our
monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest
of his life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth
year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven.
First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha,
was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span>
mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning.
He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the
monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to
say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of
worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life
struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he
thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to
whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent
heart. But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that
time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned
already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in his fourth
year he remembered her all his life???her face, her caresses, <span class="tei tei-q">???as though
she stood living before me.???</span> Such memories may persist, as every
one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but
scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out
of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all
faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open
window, the slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most
vividly of all); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a
lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing
hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms,
squeezing him close till it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother
of God, holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put
him under the Mother's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs
in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the picture!
And Alyosha remembered his mother's face at that minute. He used
to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he
rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood
and youth he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed,
but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary,
from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely
personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to
him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it.
But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put
implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton
or na??ve person. There was something about him which made
one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span>
not care to be a judge of others???that he would never take it upon
himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.
He seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation
though often grieving bitterly: and this was so much
so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest
youth. Coming at twenty to his father's house, which was a very
sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply
withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without
the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who
had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and
ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and sullenness.
<span class="tei tei-q">???He does not say much,???</span> he used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">???and thinks the more.???</span>
But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and
kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality,
yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him,
such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one before.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and
it was so from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household
of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he
gained the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him quite
as their own child. Yet he entered the house at such a tender age
that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning
affection. So that the gift of making himself loved directly and
unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very nature, so to speak.
It was the same at school, though he seemed to be just one of those
children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked
by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and rather
solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a
corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see
at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the
contrary he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show
off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never
afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he was
not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was
bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen
that an hour after the offense he would address the offender or
answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span>
though nothing had happened between them. And it was not that
he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront,
but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this completely
conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the
top want to mock at him, not from malice but because it amused
them. This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.
He could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations
about women. There are <span class="tei tei-q">???certain???</span> words and conversations unhappily
impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure in mind and
heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves,
and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even
soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much
that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite
young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is
the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as
something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing
that Alyosha Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked
of <span class="tei tei-q">???that,???</span> they used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands
away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped
to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of
abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they left him
alone and gave up taunting him with being a <span class="tei tei-q">???regular girl,???</span> and
what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness.
He was always one of the best in the class but was never first.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more
years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable
widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to
Italy with her whole family, which consisted only of women and
girls. Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of
Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had never seen before. On what
terms he lived with them he did not know himself. It was very
characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at whose expense
he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to his
elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two
years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and
had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span>
of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character
must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance
with him any one would have perceived that Alyosha
was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast,
who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune,
would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either for
good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he seemed
scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal
sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked for,
he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment,
or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov, a man very sensitive
on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following
judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might
leave alone without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of
a million inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not
die of cold and hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once;
and if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would
cost him no effort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no
burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as a
pleasure.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before
the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he
was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him.
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go. The journey was
not an expensive one, and the ladies would not let him pawn his
watch, a parting present from his benefactor's family. They provided
him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new
clothes and linen. But he returned half the money they gave him,
saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival in the town
he made no answer to his father's first inquiry why he had come
before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his
mother's tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that
was the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the
whole reason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not
understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span>
soul, and drawn him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable
path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his second
wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave since he had
thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had entirely
forgotten where she was buried.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not
been living in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death
he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa,
where he spent several years. He made the acquaintance at first,
in his own words, <span class="tei tei-q">???of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,???</span>
and ended by being received by <span class="tei tei-q">???Jews high and low alike.???</span> It may
be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for
making and hoarding money. He finally returned to our town only
three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former acquaintances
found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means an
old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with
more effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity
for making buffoons of others. His depravity with women was
not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting. In a short
time he opened a great number of new taverns in the district. It
was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not
much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were
soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,
too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more
uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing
and go on with another, as though he were letting himself go altogether.
He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had
not been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged
considerably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like
a tutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.
Alyosha's arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though
something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had
long been dead in his soul.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you know,???</span> he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">???that
you are like her, <span class="tei tei-q">???the crazy woman???</span>??????</span>???that was what he used to call
his dead wife, Alyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out
the <span class="tei tei-q">???crazy woman's???</span> grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town
cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span>
cheap but decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and
age of the deceased and the date of her death, and below a four-lined
verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class
tombs. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be
Grigory's doing. He had put it up on the poor <span class="tei tei-q">???crazy woman's???</span>
grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had
often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the
grave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion
at the sight of his mother's grave. He only listened to Grigory's
minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood
with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word. It was
perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this little
episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch???and
a very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our
monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for
the second, Alyosha's mother, the <span class="tei tei-q">???crazy woman,???</span> but for the
first, Adela??da Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening
of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha.
He himself was far from being religious; he had probably never
put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses
of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance
at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably
to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his
little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude
of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam's apple hung
below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a
peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious
mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of
black decayed teeth. He slobbered every time he began to speak.
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face, though, I believe,
he was well satisfied with it. He used particularly to point to
his nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously
aquiline. <span class="tei tei-q">???A regular Roman nose,???</span> he used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">???with my
goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of
the decadent period.???</span> He seemed proud of it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced
that he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span>
were willing to receive him as a novice. He explained that this was
his strong desire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his
father. The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living
in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon
his <span class="tei tei-q">???gentle boy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That is the most honest monk among them, of course,???</span> he observed,
after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming
scarcely surprised at his request. <span class="tei tei-q">???H'm!... So that's where you
want to be, my gentle boy????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken
grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy
slyness. <span class="tei tei-q">???H'm!... I had a presentiment that you would end in
something like this. Would you believe it? You were making
straight for it. Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand.
That's a dowry for you. And I'll never desert you, my angel. And
I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of
course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them? What do you
say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week.
H'm!... Do you know that near one monastery there's a place
outside the town where every baby knows there are none but <span class="tei tei-q">???the
monks' wives???</span> living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe.
I have been there myself. You know, it's interesting in its own
way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it's awfully Russian.
There are no French women there. Of course they could get them
fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it
they'll come along. Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no
<span class="tei tei-q">???monks' wives,???</span> and two hundred monks. They're honest. They
keep the fasts. I admit it.... H'm.... So you want to be a
monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would
you believe it, I've really grown fond of you? Well, it's a good
opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much
here. I've always been thinking who would pray for me, and
whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm
awfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully.
You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep
thinking???from time to time, of course, not all the while. It's
impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell
with their hooks when I die. Then I wonder???hooks? Where would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span>
they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge
them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in
the monastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.
Now I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling.
It makes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is.
And, after all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't?
But, do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it? If
there's no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks
it all breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be
none to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what
justice is there in the world? <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Il faudrait les
inventer</span></span>, those hooks,
on purpose for me alone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a
blackguard I am.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But there are no hooks there,???</span> said Alyosha, looking gently and
seriously at his father.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That's
how a Frenchman described hell: <span class="tei tei-q">???<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">J'ai bu l'ombre d'un
cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse.</span></span>???</span> How do
you know there are no hooks, darling? When you've lived with
the monks you'll sing a different tune. But go and get at the truth
there, and then come and tell me. Anyway it's easier going to the
other world if one knows what there is there. Besides, it will be
more seemly for you with the monks than here with me, with a
drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like an
angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch
you there. That's why I let you go, because I hope for that.
You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you will
burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will wait
for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has
not condemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't help
feeling it.???</span>

Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a
sickly, ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive
dreamer. On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown,
red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He
was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a
dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and wide-set
dark gray, shining eyes; he was very thoughtful, and apparently
very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible
with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha
was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the monastery
he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are never
a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and
if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would
rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he
admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by
him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the
miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound
by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle
Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did
see he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???My Lord and my God!???</span> Was it the miracle forced
him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he
desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart
even when he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???I do not believe till I see.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had
not finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies
is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon
this path only because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination
and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for
his soul from darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some
extent a youth of our last epoch???that is, honest in nature, desiring
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span>
the truth, seeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at
once with all the strength of his soul, seeking for immediate action,
and ready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it. Though these
young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is,
in many cases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for
instance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious
study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth
and the cause they have set before them as their goal???such a sacrifice
is utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path
Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he
chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he
reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and
immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: <span class="tei tei-q">???I want
to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.???</span> In the
same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist,
he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism
is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic
question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the
question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount
to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth. Alyosha would
have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before. It
is written: <span class="tei tei-q">???Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if
thou wouldst be perfect.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha said to himself: <span class="tei tei-q">???I can't give two roubles instead of
<span class="tei tei-q">???all,???</span> and only go to mass instead of <span class="tei tei-q">???following Him.???</span>??????</span> Perhaps his
memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his
mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight
and the holy image to which his poor <span class="tei tei-q">???crazy???</span> mother had held him
up still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may
have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice
all or only <span class="tei tei-q">???two roubles,???</span> and in the monastery he met this elder.
I must digress to explain what an <span class="tei tei-q">???elder???</span> is in Russian monasteries,
and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so. I will
try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words.
Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of <span class="tei tei-q">???elders???</span> is
of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries,
though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos, it has
existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span>
ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
Russia???the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations
with the East after the destruction of Constantinople???this institution
fell into oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end
of last century by one of the great <span class="tei tei-q">???ascetics,???</span> as they called him,
Pa??ssy Velitchkovsky, and his disciples. But to this day it exists in
few monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as
an innovation in Russia. It flourished especially in the celebrated
Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was introduced into
our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three such
elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying
of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The
question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not
been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had
neither relics of saints, nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious
traditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been glorious
all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had
flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul,
your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder,
you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission,
complete self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible
school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest,
of self-mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to
attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those
who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves
in themselves. This institution of elders is not founded on theory,
but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand
years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary <span class="tei tei-q">???obedience???</span>
which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him
and them.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon
him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt.
There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer
torture and a martyr's death for the faith. When the Church, regarding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span>
him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon's
exhortation, <span class="tei tei-q">???Depart all ye unbaptized,???</span> the coffin containing the
martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from the church,
and this took place three times. And only at last they learnt that
this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left his elder,
and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's absolution
in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral take
place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
instance.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos,
which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go
first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go
to the north to Siberia: <span class="tei tei-q">???There is the place for thee and not here.???</span>
The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the ??cumenical
Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him to release him from
his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable
to release him, but there was not and could not be on earth a power
which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that
duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases
with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many
of our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly
esteemed among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well
as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our
monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings,
and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of
the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being
arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening
of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing
of the character of the sacrament. In the end, however, the institution
of elders has been retained and is becoming established in
Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which
had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration
of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may
be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to
bondage and not to freedom.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span>
had been in the army in early youth, and served in the
Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by
some peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the
elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It
must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could
go where he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore
the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others.
No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was
deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that
so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to
Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing,
that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an
unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering
on his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed
his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken
a word.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for
the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with
bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the
fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he
was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more
drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner
the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of
his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
were few in number and they were silent, though among them were
some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the
older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows
of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very
many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.
Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though
not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt
of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and
great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics.
Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the
elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin
that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick
children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span>
and to pray over them, return shortly after???some the next day???and,
falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing their
sick.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the
natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for
Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher
and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own
triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over
when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting
crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from
all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing.
They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth
on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children
to him and brought him the sick <span class="tei tei-q">???possessed with devils.???</span>
The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them,
and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks
of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and
the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha
did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell down before
him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face. Oh! he
understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn
out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and
everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was the greatest need
and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before
and worship.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere
on earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the
truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it
will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to
the promise.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even
reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this
saint and custodian of God's truth???of that he had no more doubt
than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their
children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the elder
would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger
in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span>
of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart. He
was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example
before him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of
renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on
the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there
will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will
be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will
come.???</span> That was the dream in Alyosha's heart.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till
then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more
quickly made friends with his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived
later) than with his own brother Ivan. He was extremely
interested in his brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two
months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were
still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be
expecting something, ashamed about something, while his brother
Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him.
Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his
brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education.
But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and
sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown
to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something???something
inward and important???that he was striving
towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was
why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether
there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for
him???a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was
an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed;
yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand,
he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used
to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar
earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important
affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri's enthusiastic references
to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri
was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span>
were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be
difficult to find two men more unlike.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the
members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the
elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The
pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time that
the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest
stage and their relations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor
Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in
joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's cell, and that,
without appealing to his direct intervention, they might more
decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence
of the elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder,
naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but,
as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his
father on several recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It
must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with his father,
but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened that
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov, who was staying in the district at
the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the forties and fifties,
a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom
or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the
desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with
the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing
the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor
coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more
attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity.
Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the
elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced
by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented
to see them, and the day was fixed.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Who has made me a judge over them????</span> was all he said, smilingly,
to Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit.
Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one
who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would
come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder.
Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Mi??sov would come from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span>
curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be
contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing,
Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was
far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the
day with a heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his
mind how the family discord could be ended. But his chief anxiety
concerned the elder. He trembled for him, for his glory, and
dreaded any affront to him, especially the refined, courteous irony of
Mi??sov and the supercilious half-utterances of the highly educated
Ivan. He even wanted to venture on warning the elder, telling him
something about them, but, on second thoughts, said nothing. He
only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his brother
Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep his promise.
Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had promised,
but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let
himself be provoked <span class="tei tei-q">???by vileness,???</span> but that, although he had a deep
respect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that
the meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking
in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,???</span> he
wrote in conclusion. Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview
with the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately
after late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but
arrived just as it was over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn
by two valuable horses, drove up with Mi??sov and a distant relative
of his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov.
This young man was preparing to enter the university. Mi??sov,
with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him
to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young man
was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He
was nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange
fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he
would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was
silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with
any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything
or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared.
He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had
already some independent fortune and expectations of much more.
He was a friend of Alyosha's.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of
old pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Mi??sov's carriage, came
Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though
he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors
left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to
the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch,
none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Mi??sov had
probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span>
about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease. But, except
the church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary
enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the
monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the
church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler
people were a few of higher rank???two or three ladies and a very
old general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were
at once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything,
except young Kalganov, who took a ten-copeck piece out of
his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed???God knows why!???hurriedly
gave it to an old woman, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">???Divide it equally.???</span> None
of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no
reason to be embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more
overcome.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that
they were not received with special honor, though one of them had
recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was
a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in
the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit
might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands.
Yet no official personage met them.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mi??sov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the
church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here
must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this <span class="tei tei-q">???holy
place,???</span> but refrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost
into anger.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must
find out, for time is passing,???</span> he observed suddenly, as though
speaking to himself.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating
little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting
his hat, he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a
landowner of Tula. He at once entered into our visitors' difficulty.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces
from the monastery, the other side of the copse.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I know it's the other side of the copse,???</span> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,
<span class="tei tei-q">???but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since
we've been here.???</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the
copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go....
I am going myself. This way, this way.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov,
a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to
stare at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity.
His eyes looked starting out of his head.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,???</span>
observed Mi??sov severely. <span class="tei tei-q">???That personage has granted us an audience,

way, we cannot ask you to accompany us.???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???I've been there. I've been already; <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">un
chevalier parfait</span></span>,???</span> and
Maximov snapped his fingers in the air.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Who is a <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">chevalier</span></span>????</span> asked Mi??sov.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory
of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking
monk of medium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them.
Fyodor Pavlovitch and Mi??sov stopped.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with
him after your visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later.
And you also,???</span> he added, addressing Maximov.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That I certainly will, without fail,???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,
hugely delighted at the invitation. <span class="tei tei-q">???And, believe me, we've all
given our word to behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, will you go, too????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the
customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you suppose
I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we will
come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior,???</span> he said to the monk.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,???</span> answered
the monk.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior???to the Father
Superior,???</span> babbled Maximov.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please??????</span>
the monk hesitated.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Impertinent old man!???</span> Mi??sov observed aloud, while Maximov
ran back to the monastery.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He's like von Sohn,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von
Sohn? Have you ever seen von Sohn????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable.
He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the
physiognomy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word
to behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself.
But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated with
you here.... You see what a man he is???</span>???he turned to the monk???<span class="tei tei-q">???I'm
afraid to go among decent people with him.???</span> A fine smile,
not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of
the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a
sense of his own dignity. Mi??sov frowned more than ever.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through
centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,???</span>
flashed through Mi??sov's mind.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<span class="tei tei-q">???The gates are shut.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted
above and on the sides of the gates.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here
in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They
look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in
at this gate. That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But
I did hear that the elder receives ladies,???</span> he remarked suddenly to
the monk.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there
waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built
adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts???you can see the
windows???and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when
he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts. There is
a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her sick
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span>
daughter. Probably he has promised to come out to her, though
of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even
to the people.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage
to the ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any
harm. But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of
women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex???no hens,
nor turkey-hens, nor cows.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you
here. They'll turn you out when I'm gone.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,???</span>
he cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, <span class="tei tei-q">???what a vale of
roses they live in!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and
beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for
them, and evidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds
round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied
wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy?
He didn't care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and
thrash even ladies with a stick,???</span> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he
went up the steps.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a
great deal that's told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,???</span>
answered the monk. <span class="tei tei-q">???Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute
I will announce you.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you
hear? Behave properly or I will pay you out!???</span> Mi??sov had time to
mutter again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I can't think why you are so agitated,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch observed
sarcastically. <span class="tei tei-q">???Are you uneasy about your sins? They say
he can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot
you think of their opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm
surprised at you.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Mi??sov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were
asked to come in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and
begin to quarrel???and lower myself and my ideas,???</span> he reflected.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They entered the room almost at the same moment that the
elder came in from his bedroom. There were already in the
cell, awaiting the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the
Father Librarian, and the other Father Pa??ssy, a very learned man, so
they said, in delicate health, though not old. There was also a tall
young man, who looked about two and twenty, standing in the
corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh face, and
clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary
dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of
the monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,
reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position,
and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet
them with a bow.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha.
The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching
the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing
them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked
their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously
and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But
Mi??sov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness.
He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought???he had reflected
upon it the evening before???from simple politeness, since it was
the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing,
even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing
and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind.
With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and
moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking
Mi??sov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy,
but he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused
that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised
to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down.
The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was ashamed. His forebodings
were coming true.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa,
covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along
the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby
black leather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the
window. The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained
standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained
nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor
quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a number
of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon of
the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures
in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china
eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it,
and several foreign engravings from the great Italian artists of past
centuries. Next to these costly and artistic engravings were several
of the roughest Russian prints of saints and martyrs, such as are
sold for a few farthings at all the fairs. On the other walls were
portraits of Russian bishops, past and present.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mi??sov took a cursory glance at all these <span class="tei tei-q">???conventional???</span> surroundings
and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high
opinion of his own insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was
fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established
position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously. At the first
moment he did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something in
the elder's face which many people besides Mi??sov might not have
liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and
though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years older.
His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,
particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,
quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling
of gray hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small
and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as
two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird's beak.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,???</span> thought
Mi??sov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and
served to begin the conversation.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Precisely to our time,???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">???but no sign
of my son, Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!???</span> (Alyosha
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span>
shuddered all over at <span class="tei tei-q">???sacred elder.???</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">???I am always punctual myself,
minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy
of kings....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But you are not a king, anyway,???</span> Mi??sov muttered, losing his
self-restraint at once.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I
always say the wrong thing. Your reverence,???</span> he cried, with sudden
pathos, <span class="tei tei-q">???you behold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce
myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes
talk nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of
amusing people and making myself agreeable. One must be agreeable,
mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town where I
had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We
went to the captain of police because we had to see him about
something, and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair,
sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver.
I went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the world,
you know, <span class="tei tei-q">???Mr. Ispravnik,???</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">???be our Napravnik.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???What do
you mean by Napravnik????</span> said he. I saw, at the first half-second,
that it had missed fire. He stood there so glum. <span class="tei tei-q">???I wanted to make
a joke,???</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">???for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our
well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the
harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.???</span> And I
explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? <span class="tei tei-q">???Excuse me,???</span>
said he, <span class="tei tei-q">???I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on
my calling.???</span> He turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting,
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???No,???</span> he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">???since you called me a Napravnik I am one.???</span> And would you
believe it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always
like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness. Once, many
years ago, I said to an influential person: <span class="tei tei-q">???Your wife is a ticklish
lady,???</span> in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak. But
he asked me, <span class="tei tei-q">???Why, have you tickled her????</span> I thought I'd be polite,
so I couldn't help saying, <span class="tei tei-q">???Yes,???</span> and he gave me a fine tickling on
the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to tell
the story. I'm always injuring myself like that.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You're doing it now,???</span> muttered Mi??sov, with disgust.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr
Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as
soon as I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that
you'd be the first to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't
coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they
were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in
them. That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes
for my living in noblemen's families. I am an inveterate buffoon,
and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were
a craze in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only a little
one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But
not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth
having either. But I do believe???I believe in God, though I have
had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom.
I'm like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever
hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan
Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and
said straight out, <span class="tei tei-q">???There is no God.???</span> To which the great bishop
lifted up his finger and answered, <span class="tei tei-q">???The fool hath said in his heart
there is no God.???</span> And he fell down at his feet on the spot. <span class="tei tei-q">???I
believe,???</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">???and will be christened.???</span> And so he was. Princess
Dashkov was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling
lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing
the fool????</span> cried Mi??sov in a shaking voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried with conviction. <span class="tei tei-q">???But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen.
Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's
christening I made up just now. I never thought of it before. I
made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
to make myself agreeable. Though I really don't know myself,
sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot, I heard as far as
<span class="tei tei-q">???the fool hath said in his heart???</span> twenty times from the gentry about
here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
tell the story. They all believe to this day that the infidel Diderot
came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan Platon....???</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mi??sov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was
furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty
or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had
entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration.
Almost every one admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was
being shown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole visit.
Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and learning,
some even freethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception
had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here
there was no question of money, but only, on the one side love and
kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some
spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered
the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with
unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear
what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up,
like Mi??sov. Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of
tears. What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother
Ivan, on whom alone he had rested his hopes, and who alone had such
influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat now quite
unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to
see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it.
Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity student, whom
he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin's
thoughts.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Forgive me,???</span> began Mi??sov, addressing Father Zossima, <span class="tei tei-q">???for
perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made
a mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would
understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage. I
did not suppose I should have to apologize simply for having come
with him....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't distress yourself, I beg.???</span> The elder got on to his feeble
legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit
down again. <span class="tei tei-q">???I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg
you to be my guest.???</span> And with a bow he went back and sat down
again on his little sofa.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity????</span> Fyodor
Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both
hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be

quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself,
for that is at the root of it all.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too
much, but I accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed
Father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't
risk it.... I will not go so far as that myself. I warn you for
your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty,
though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for
you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for you,
holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">???Blessed be
the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck???the
paps especially. When you said just now, <span class="tei tei-q">???Don't be so ashamed of
yourself, for that is at the root of it all,???</span> you pierced right through
me by that remark, and read me to the core. Indeed, I always feel
when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take
me for a buffoon. So I say, <span class="tei tei-q">???Let me really play the buffoon. I am
not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of you worse than
I am.???</span> That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame, great elder,
from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me rowdy.
If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest
and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have
been then! Teacher!???</span> he fell suddenly on his knees, <span class="tei tei-q">???what must I
do to gain eternal life????</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really
moved.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a
smile:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You have known for a long time what you must do. You
have sense enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence
of speech; don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span>
love of money. And close your taverns. If you can't close all,
at least two or three. And, above all???don't lie.???</span>

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The
man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a
pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around
him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having
no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract
himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures,
and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other
men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily
offended than any one. You know it is sometimes very pleasant
to take offense, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has insulted
him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and
exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made
a mountain out of a molehill???he knows that himself, yet he will
be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he
feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But
get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the
elder's thin hand. <span class="tei tei-q">???It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said
that so well, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life
taking offense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds,
for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted???that
you had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I
shall make a note of that. But I have been lying, lying positively
my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a
lie, and the father of lies. Though I believe I am not the father of
lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that
will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk
about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word
will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I
had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose
to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch
not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great
Father, that the story is told somewhere in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lives of the Saints</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span>
of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut
off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, <span class="tei tei-q">???courteously kissing
it,???</span> walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not,
honored Father????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, it is untrue,???</span> said the elder.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What

<span class="tei tei-q">???I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I

know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov here, who was
so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have
been getting more and more shaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,
you were the cause of a great fall. That was not a
Diderot!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly
clear to every one by now that he was playing a part again.

<span class="tei tei-q">???What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,???</span> he muttered. <span class="tei tei-q">???I may

it was read at our mass from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lives of the Saints</span></span> ... he was
a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics

<span class="tei tei-q">???You defile everything you touch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elder suddenly rose from his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">???Excuse me, gentlemen,
for leaving you a few minutes,???</span> he said, addressing all his guests.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don't

with a good-humored face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and
the novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless:
he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder
was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going
towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But
Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe
me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you.
I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on
with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am
ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of
the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant
women. They had been told that the elder was at last coming out,
and they had gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame
Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come out into the portico to
wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women
of rank.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive,
and always dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had
lively black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had
been five years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially
paralyzed. The poor child had not been able to walk for the
last six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair.
She had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of
gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span>
their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her
abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the
summer by business connected with their estate. They had been staying
a week in our town, where they had come more for purposes of
business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already,
three days before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw
any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated
<span class="tei tei-q">???the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's
invalid carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one
of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the
far north. He too sought the elder's blessing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight
to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that
led up into the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put
on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him.
One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight
of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains
of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short
prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often
happened to see and hear these <span class="tei tei-q">???possessed???</span> women in the villages
and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would
squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the
church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led
up to it, at once the <span class="tei tei-q">???possession???</span> ceased, and the sick women were
always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at
this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from
my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid
work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various
anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with
astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about
it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially
prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of
the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting
toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth,
and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which
some women were not able to endure like others. The strange and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span>
instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she
was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me
as due to malingering and the trickery of the <span class="tei tei-q">???clericals,???</span> arose
probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported
her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond
question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out
if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow
down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged
woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took
place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down
to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing
and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did
come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same
now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy
by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment,
others cried out in sing-song voices.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The <span class="tei tei-q">???possessed???</span>
woman he knew already. She came from a village only six
versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But here is one from afar.???</span> He pointed to a woman by no
means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt
but almost blackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing
with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied
in her eyes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles
from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!???</span> the woman
began in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge,
swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her
hand.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among
the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a
grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and
finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women.
But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort
only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire
consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations
spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though

have all gone. I buried the first three without grieving overmuch,
and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always
standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my
heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and
I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I look
at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, <span class="tei tei-q">???Let me go on a
pilgrimage, master.???</span> He is a driver. We're not poor people,
Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the
horse and the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My
Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used
to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it. But
now I don't think about him. It's three months since I left home.
I've forgotten him. I've forgotten everything. I don't want to
remember. And what would our life be now together? I've done
with him, I've done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look
upon my house and my goods. I don't care to see anything at all!???</span>

her only one, whom God had taken. <span class="tei tei-q">???Knowest thou not,???</span> said the

God? Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of
Heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">???Thou didst give us life, O Lord,???</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">???and scarcely
had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again.???</span> And
so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the

rank of angels. Therefore,???</span> said the saint, <span class="tei tei-q">???thou, too, O mother, rejoice
and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship
of the angels.???</span> That's what the saint said to the weeping
mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken
falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is
surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying
to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her
hand. She sighed deeply.

<span class="tei tei-q">???My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you.

he be if not with the Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not

him one little time, if only I could peep at him one little time, without
going up to him, without speaking, if I could be hidden in a
corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him playing
in the yard, calling in his little voice, <span class="tei tei-q">???Mammy, where are you????</span>
If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room
just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used
to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet
I should know him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone, and I shall

as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her
eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden
stream.

the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you and sees
you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the Lord God;

it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be

the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes showed that she had come
with an object, and in order to say something. She said she was
the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the
town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had
gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but
now a year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about
him, but she did not know the proper place to inquire.

But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes
fixed upon him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young
peasant woman was gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought
him, but she seemed afraid to approach.

Father. I am afraid of my sin.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer
to him, still on her knees.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I am a widow these three years,???</span> she began in a half-whisper,
with a sort of shudder. <span class="tei tei-q">???I had a hard life with my husband. He
was an old man. He used to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought
looking at him, if he were to get well, if he were to get up again,
what then? And then the thought came to me??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Stay!???</span> said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible
to catch anything. She had soon done.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Three years ago????</span> asked the elder.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your
penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span>
can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to
the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust
the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could
exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance,
but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you
as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your sin.
It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more
joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be
not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive
the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled
with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love
you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by
love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have
pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless
treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not
only your own sins but the sins of others.???</span>

a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth
without speaking.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the
peasants and his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped
them away with her handkerchief. She was a sentimental society
lady of genuinely good disposition in many respects. When the
elder went up to her at last she met him enthusiastically.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...???</span>
She could not go on for emotion. <span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, I understand the
people's love for you. I love the people myself. I want to love
them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian
people, so simple in their greatness!???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How is your daughter's health? You wanted to talk to me
again????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it!
I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your
windows until you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express
our ardent gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her
completely, merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying
your hands upon her. We have hastened here to kiss those hands,
to pour out our feelings and our homage.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in
her chair.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,???</span>
said the lady with nervous haste. <span class="tei tei-q">???And that's not all. Her legs
are stronger. This morning she got up well; she had slept all night.
Look at her rosy cheeks, her bright eyes! She used to be always
crying, but now she laughs and is gay and happy. This morning
she insisted on my letting her stand up, and she stood up for a whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span>
minute without any support. She wagers that in a fortnight she'll
be dancing a quadrille. I've called in Doctor Herzenstube. He
shrugged his shoulders and said, <span class="tei tei-q">???I am amazed; I can make nothing
of it.???</span> And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not
fly here to thank you? Lise, thank him???thank him!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She
rose in her chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder,
clasped her hands before him, but could not restrain herself and
broke into laughter.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's at him,???</span> she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation
at herself for not being able to repress her mirth.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the
elder, he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in
an instant. His eyes shone and he looked down.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are
you????</span> the mother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand
to Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at
Alyosha. The latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely
awkward way, held out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important
air.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.???</span> She handed
him a little note. <span class="tei tei-q">???She particularly begs you to go and see her
as soon as possible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to
come.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for????</span> Alyosha
muttered in great astonishment. His face at once looked anxious.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, it's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and???what has happened
lately,???</span> the mother explained hurriedly. <span class="tei tei-q">???Katerina Ivanovna
has made up her mind, but she must see you about it.... Why,
of course, I can't say. But she wants to see you at once. And you
will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I have only seen her once,???</span> Alyosha protested with the same
perplexity.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her
suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is
enduring now! Think what awaits her! It's all terrible, terrible!???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Very well, I will come,???</span> Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning
the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty
that he would come, without any sort of explanation.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!???</span> cried Lise
with sudden animation. <span class="tei tei-q">???I told mamma you'd be sure not to go.
I said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are! I've always
thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Lise!???</span> said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she
had said it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,???</span> she said;
<span class="tei tei-q">???you never come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is
never happy except with you.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again
smiled without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching
him. He had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before,
had been awaiting his entrance by Lise's chair. He was evidently
a monk of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a
narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in his own way, a stubborn
one. He announced that he had come from the far north, from
Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery,
consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing
and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How can you presume to do such deeds????</span> the monk asked suddenly,
pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring
to her <span class="tei tei-q">???healing.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete
cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there
has been any healing, it is by no power but God's will. It's all from
God. Visit me, Father,???</span> he added to the monk. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's not often I
can see visitors. I am ill, and I know that my days are numbered.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a
long, long time yet,???</span> cried the lady. <span class="tei tei-q">???And in what way are you ill?
You look so well, so gay and happy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only
for a moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem
so happy to you, you could never say anything that would please
me so much. For men are made for happiness, and any one who is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span>
completely happy has a right to say to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">???I am doing God's
will on earth.???</span> All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs
were happy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!???</span> cried the
lady. <span class="tei tei-q">???You seem to pierce with your words. And yet???happiness,
happiness???where is it? Who can say of himself that he is happy?
Oh, since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day,
let me tell you what I could not utter last time, what I dared
not say, all I am suffering and have been for so long! I am suffering!
Forgive me! I am suffering!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???From what specially????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I suffer ... from lack of faith.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life???it
is such an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen!
You are a healer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of
course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure
you on my word of honor that I am not speaking lightly now. The
thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to
terror. And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared
to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God!
What will you think of me now????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She clasped her hands.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you,???</span> said the elder.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and
ask myself if every one has faith, where did it come from? And
then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena
of nature, and that none of it's real. And I say to myself,
<span class="tei tei-q">???What if I've been believing all my life, and when I come to die
there's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave????</span> as I read
in some author. It's awful! How???how can I get back my faith?
But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically, without
thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come
now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this
chance slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it?
How can I convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span>
and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares; no one
troubles his head about it, and I'm the only one who can't stand it.
It's deadly???deadly!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be convinced
of it.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor
actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you
will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your
soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your
neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can
possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???In active love? There's another question???and such a question!
You see, I so love humanity that???would you believe it????I often
dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister
of mercy. I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that
moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles. No
wounds, no festering sores could at that moment frighten me. I
would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would
nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams
and not others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in
reality.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes. But could I endure such a life for long????</span> the lady went
on fervently, almost frantically. <span class="tei tei-q">???That's the chief question???that's
my most agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself,
<span class="tei tei-q">???Would you persevere long on that path? And if the patient whose
wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried
you with his whims, without valuing or remarking your
charitable services, began abusing you and rudely commanding you,
and complaining to the superior authorities of you (which often
happens when people are in great suffering)???what then? Would
you persevere in your love, or not????</span> And do you know, I came with
horror to the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love
to humanity, it would be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant,
I expect my payment at once???that is, praise, and the repayment
of love with love. Otherwise I am incapable of loving any
one.???</span>

She was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding,
she looked with defiant resolution at the elder.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's just the same story as a doctor once told me,???</span> observed
the elder. <span class="tei tei-q">???He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly
clever. He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I love humanity,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???but I wonder at myself. The more I love
humanity in general, the less I love man in particular. In my
dreams,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes
for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced
crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable
of living in the same room with any one for two days
together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me,
his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom.
In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one
because he's too long over his dinner; another because he has a cold
and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment
they come close to me. But it has always happened that the
more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love
for humanity.???</span>??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must
one despair????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you
can, and it will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you
since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have
been talking to me so sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your
frankness, as you did from me just now, then of course you will not
attain to anything in the achievement of real love; it will all get
no further than dreams, and your whole life will slip away like a
phantom. In that case you will naturally cease to think of the
future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion
in the end.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand
that I was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity
when I told you I could not endure ingratitude. You have revealed
me to myself. You have seen through me and explained me to
myself!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession,
I believe that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span>
attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road,
and try not to leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of
falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own
deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid
being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you
bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing
it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence
of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don't be frightened overmuch
even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling
to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared
with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate
action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even
give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon
over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage.
But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too,
perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you see
with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther
from your goal instead of nearer to it???at that very moment I predict
that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power
of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously
guiding you. Forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you.
They are waiting for me. Good-by.???</span>

The lady was weeping.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Lise, Lise! Bless her???bless her!???</span> she cried, starting up suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness

at Alexey????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time.
She had noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at
her, and she found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to
catch his eye. Alyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was
irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she
smiled triumphantly in his face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted
and vexed. At last he turned away from her altogether and
hid behind the elder's back. After a few minutes, drawn by the
same irresistible force, he turned again to see whether he was being
looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out of her chair
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span>
to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look. Catching
his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying, <span class="tei tei-q">???Why
do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed
and her face became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and
nervously in a warm and resentful voice:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me
about when I was little. We used to play together. He used to
come to teach me to read, do you know. Two years ago, when he
went away, he said that he would never forget me, that we were
friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he's afraid of me all at
once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn't he want to come near
me? Why doesn't he talk? Why won't he come and see us? It's not
that you won't let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It's
not good manners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought
of it first, if he hasn't forgotten me. No, now he's saving his soul!
Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he'll fall.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into
irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened
to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed
his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't be angry with me. I'm silly and good for nothing ...

The elder's absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-five
minutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on
whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But
he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the
cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan
and the two monks took the leading share in it. Mi??sov, too, was
trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span>
But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the
background, and his remarks were treated with neglect, which increased
his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with
Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan
showed him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be
quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his
neighbor Mi??sov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying
his discomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off
old scores, and now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending
over his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why didn't you go away just now, after the <span class="tei tei-q">???courteously kissing???</span>?
Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company?
It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained
to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence. Now you
won't go till you've displayed your intellect to them.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You'll be the last, the last of all to go!???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered
him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father
Zossima's return.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating
himself in his former place, looked at them all as though cordially
inviting them to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his
face, saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort.
Of late he had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face
had the pallor that was common before such attacks, and his lips
were white. But he evidently did not want to break up the party.
He seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them.
What object? Alyosha watched him intently.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,???</span> said
Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.
<span class="tei tei-q">???He brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument
cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an
ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court,
and the scope of its jurisdiction.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He takes up a most interesting position,???</span> continued the Father
Librarian. <span class="tei tei-q">???As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently
quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's interesting. But in what sense????</span> Father Zossima asked
Ivan.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha
had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill
and apparently without the slightest
<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">arri??re-pens??e</span></span>.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is,
of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on
for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle,
and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent
or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation
of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such
questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible
in any real sense. My clerical opponent maintains that the
Church holds a precise and defined position in the State. I maintain,
on the contrary, that the Church ought to include the whole
State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and, if this is, for
some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in reality, to be
set up as the direct and chief aim of the future development of
Christian society!???</span>

following <span class="tei tei-q">???fundamental and essential???</span> propositions of his opponent,
who is, you must note, an ecclesiastic. First, that <span class="tei tei-q">???no social organization
can or ought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the
civic and political rights of its members.???</span> Secondly, that <span class="tei tei-q">???criminal
and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong to the Church, and is
inconsistent with its nature, both as a divine institution and as an
organization of men for religious objects,???</span> and, finally, in the third
place, <span class="tei tei-q">???the Church is a kingdom not of this world.???</span>??????</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!???</span> Father
Pa??ssy could not refrain from breaking in again. <span class="tei tei-q">???I have read the
book which you have answered,???</span> he added, addressing Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">???and
was astounded at the words <span class="tei tei-q">???the Church is a kingdom not of this
world.???</span> If it is not of this world, then it cannot exist on earth at
all. In the Gospel, the words <span class="tei tei-q">???not of this world???</span> are not used in that
sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus
Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of
Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is
only entered through the Church which has been founded and
established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in
such a connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in
truth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly
become the kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that
we have the divine promise.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After
listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the
elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the
first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church
and was nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire
desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming
Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan State
in very many of its departments. In reality this was bound to
happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan
civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and
fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering
into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental
principles???the rock on which it stands???and could pursue
no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed
by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole world,
and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the Church. In
that way (that is, with a view to the future) it is not the Church
that should seek a definite position in the State, like <span class="tei tei-q">???every social
organization,???</span> or as <span class="tei tei-q">???an organization of men for religious purposes???</span>
(as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the contrary, every
earthly State should be, in the end, completely transformed into the
Church and should become nothing else but a Church, rejecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span>
every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this
will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory
as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it
from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful
path, which alone leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author
of the book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction</span></span> would have
judged correctly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations,
he had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in
our sinful and imperfect days. But as soon as the author ventures
to declare that the foundations which he predicates now, part of
which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the permanent, essential,
and eternal foundations, he is going directly against the Church
and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist of my article.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That is, in brief,???</span> Father Pa??ssy began again, laying stress on each
word, <span class="tei tei-q">???according to certain theories only too clearly formulated
in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into
the State, as though this would be an advance from a lower to a
higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way for science, for
the spirit of the age, and civilization. And if the Church resists
and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart for her in the State,
and even that under control???and this will be so everywhere in all
modern European countries. But Russian hopes and conceptions
demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower into a
higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State should
end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else.
So be it! So be it!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat,???</span> Mi??sov said
smiling, again crossing his legs. <span class="tei tei-q">???So far as I understand, then, the
realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming
of Christ. That's as you please. It's a beautiful Utopian dream
of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on???something
after the fashion of socialism, indeed. But I imagined that it was
all meant seriously, and that the Church might be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> going to try
criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and even death.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church
would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death.
Crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span>
at once of course, but fairly soon,???</span> Ivan replied calmly, without
flinching.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Are you serious????</span> Mi??sov glanced keenly at him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all
the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,???</span>
Ivan went on. <span class="tei tei-q">???I ask you, what would become of the excluded?
He would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from
Christ. By his crime he would have transgressed not only against
men but against the Church of Christ. This is so even now, of
course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very,
very often the criminal of to-day compromises with his conscience:
<span class="tei tei-q">???I steal,???</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">???but I don't go against the Church. I'm not an
enemy of Christ.???</span> That's what the criminal of to-day is continually
saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State
it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over the
world, to say: <span class="tei tei-q">???All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are
the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian
Church.???</span> It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it
requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on
the other side, take the Church's own view of crime: is it not bound
to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to change from
a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation
of society, as at present, into completely and honestly adopting the
idea of the regeneration of the man, of his reformation and salvation????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What do you mean? I fail to understand again,???</span> Mi??sov interrupted.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even
incomprehensible. What is excommunication? What sort of exclusion?
I suspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,???</span> said the elder suddenly,
and all turned to him at once. <span class="tei tei-q">???If it were not for the
Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal
from evil-doing, no real chastisement for it afterwards; none, that
is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the
majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real punishment,
the only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one,
which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.???</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How is that, may one inquire????</span> asked Mi??sov, with lively
curiosity.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why,???</span> began the elder, <span class="tei tei-q">???all these sentences to exile with hard
labor, and formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's
more, deter hardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes
does not diminish but is continually on the increase. You must
admit that. Consequently the security of society is not preserved,
for, although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and
sent far away out of sight, another criminal always comes to take
his place at once, and often two of them. If anything does preserve
society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform
the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience.
It is only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christian
society???that is, of the Church???that he recognizes his sin against
society???that is, against the Church. So that it is only against
the Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day
can recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,
then it would know when to bring back from exclusion
and to reunite to itself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction,
but only the power of moral condemnation, withdraws of her
own accord from punishing the criminal actively. She does not
excommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of
him. What is more, the Church even tries to preserve all Christian
communion with the criminal. She admits him to church services,
to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats him more as a
captive than as a convict. And what would become of the criminal,
O Lord, if even the Christian society???that is, the Church???were to
reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off?
What would become of him if the Church punished him with her
excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law?
There could be no more terrible despair, at least for a Russian
criminal, for Russian criminals still have faith. Though, who
knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the
despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what
would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving
mother, holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner
is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must
be at least some one to have pity on him. The Church holds aloof,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span>
above all, because its judgment is the only one that contains the
truth, and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any
other judgment even as a temporary compromise. She can enter
into no compact about that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely
repents, for the very doctrines of to-day confirm him in the idea
that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly
oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a force that
triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of themselves
in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness,
and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate
of the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without the
compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there
are no churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid
church buildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago
striven to pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely.
So it seems at least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome,
it was proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand years ago.
And so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of
the Church and sinks into despair. If he returns to society, often
it is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off.
You can judge for yourself how it must end. In many cases it
would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is that besides
the established law courts we have the Church too, which always
keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son.
And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought, the
judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice
is still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively
recognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said
here just now is true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the
Church were introduced in practice in its full force, that is, if the
whole of the society were changed into the Church, not only the
judgment of the Church would have influence on the reformation
of the criminal such as it never has now, but possibly also the crimes
themselves would be incredibly diminished. And there can be no
doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the crime
of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed
in restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in
regenerating the fallen. It is true,???</span> said Father Zossima, with a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span>
smile, <span class="tei tei-q">???the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting
on some seven righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will
continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation
from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal
and all-powerful Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at
the end of the ages, for it is ordained to come to pass! And there
is no need to be troubled about times and seasons, for the secret
of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of God, in His foresight,
and His love. And what in human reckoning seems still afar off,
may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve of its
appearance. And so be it, so be it!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So be it, so be it!???</span> Father Pa??ssy repeated austerely and reverently.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Strange, extremely strange!???</span> Mi??sov pronounced, not so much
with heat as with latent indignation.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What strikes you as so strange????</span> Father Iosif inquired cautiously.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why, it's beyond anything!???</span> cried Mi??sov, suddenly breaking
out; <span class="tei tei-q">???the State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position
of the State. It's not simply Ultramontanism, it's arch-Ultramontanism!
It's beyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are completely misunderstanding it,???</span> said Father Pa??ssy
sternly. <span class="tei tei-q">???Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the
State. That is Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation
of the devil. On the contrary, the State is transformed into the
Church, will ascend and become a Church over the whole world???which
is the complete opposite of Ultramontanism and Rome, and
your interpretation, and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the
Orthodox Church. This star will arise in the east!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mi??sov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinary
personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending
smile played on his lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing
heart. The whole conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced
casually at Rakitin, who was standing immovable in his place by
the door listening and watching intently though with downcast
eyes. But from the color in his cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin
was probably no less excited, and he knew what caused his excitement.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,???</span> Mi??sov
said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. <span class="tei tei-q">???Some years ago,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span>
soon after the <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">coup d'??tat</span></span>
of December, I happened to be calling
in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government,
and I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual
was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a
whole regiment of political detectives???a rather powerful position
in its own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity
of conversation with him. And as he had not come as a
visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as
he saw the reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak
with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was
rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,
especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The
subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted.
I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this
person. <span class="tei tei-q">???We are not particularly afraid,???</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">???of all these socialists,
anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them
and know all their goings on. But there are a few peculiar men
among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same
time are socialists. These are the people we are most afraid of.
They are dreadful people! The socialist who is a Christian is more
to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.???</span> The words struck
me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to me here,
gentlemen.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists????</span> Father
Pa??ssy asked directly, without beating about the bush.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer,
the door opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,
came in. They had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his
sudden appearance caused some surprise for a moment.
</p><br>

</div>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">


<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty,
of medium height and agreeable countenance, looked older
than his years. He was muscular, and showed signs of considerable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span>
physical strength. Yet there was something not healthy in his face.
It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy
sallowness in their color. His rather large, prominent, dark
eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet there was a
vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking
irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed
something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing.
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's hard to tell what he's thinking,???</span> those who talked to him
sometimes declared. People who saw something pensive and sullen
in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness
to mirthful and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his
eyes were so gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy
to understand at this moment. Every one knew, or had heard of,
the extremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading
of late, as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused
in his quarrels with his father. There were several stories current
in the town about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, <span class="tei tei-q">???of
an unstable and unbalanced mind,???</span> as our justice of the peace,
Katchalnikov, happily described him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned
frock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat.
Having only lately left the army, he still had mustaches and no
beard. His dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward
on his temples. He had the long, determined stride of a
military man. He stood still for a moment on the threshold, and
glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing
him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked his blessing.
Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissed
his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he
said:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so
long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to
my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.
Now I suddenly learn??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't disturb yourself,???</span> interposed the elder. <span class="tei tei-q">???No matter. You
are a little late. It's of no consequence....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your
goodness.???</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly
towards his father, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful
bow. He had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this
bow in all seriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and
good intentions.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal
to the occasion. In response to Dmitri's bow he jumped up from his
chair and made his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly
solemn and impressive, which gave him a positively malignant
look. Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without a word
walked to the window with his long, resolute stride, sat down on the
only empty chair, near Father Pa??ssy, and, bending forward, prepared
to listen to the conversation he had interrupted.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the
conversation was resumed. But this time Mi??sov thought it unnecessary
to reply to Father Pa??ssy's persistent and almost irritable
question.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,???</span> he observed with
a certain well-bred nonchalance. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's a subtle question, too. Here
Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting
to say about that also. Ask him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Nothing special, except one little remark,???</span> Ivan replied at once.
<span class="tei tei-q">???European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often
mix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity.
This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it's not
only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity,
but, in many cases, it appears, the police???the foreign police, of
course???do the same. Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,???</span> Mi??sov
repeated. <span class="tei tei-q">???I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting
and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself.
Only five days ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he
solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole
world to make men love their neighbors. That there was no law
of nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there had
been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural law,
but simply because men have believed in immortality. Ivan Fyodorovitch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span>
added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that
faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality,
not only love but every living force maintaining the
life of the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing
then would be immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.
That's not all. He ended by asserting that for every individual,
like ourselves, who does not believe in God or immortality,
the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact
contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even to crime,
must become not only lawful but even recognized as the inevitable,
the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position. From
this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric
and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's theories.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Excuse me,???</span> Dmitri cried suddenly; <span class="tei tei-q">???if I've heard aright, crime
must not only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable
and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel!
Is that so or not????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Quite so,???</span> said Father Pa??ssy.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I'll remember it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly
as he had begun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
disappearance of the faith in immortality????</span> the elder asked Ivan
suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is
no immortality.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why unhappy????</span> Ivan asked smiling.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the immortality
of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in
your article on Church jurisdiction.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn't altogether joking,???</span>
Ivan suddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question
is still fretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes
sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it
by despair itself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself
with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span>
don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock
at them inwardly.... That question you have not answered, and
it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative????</span>
Ivan went on asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the
same inexplicable smile.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided
in the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your
heart, and all its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who
has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking
and seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God
grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth, and may God
bless your path.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the
cross over Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his
seat, went up to him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand
went back to his place in silence. His face looked firm and earnest.
This action and all the preceding conversation, which was so surprising
from Ivan, impressed every one by its strangeness and a certain
solemnity, so that all were silent for a moment, and there was a
look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's face. But Mi??sov suddenly
shrugged his shoulders. And at the same moment Fyodor
Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Most pious and holy elder,???</span> he cried, pointing to Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">???that is
my son, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most
dutiful Karl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in,
Dmitri, against whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful
Franz Moor???they are both out of Schiller's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robbers</span></span>, and so
I am the reigning Count von Moor! Judge and save us! We need not
only your prayers but your prophecies!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the
members of your family,???</span> answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted
voice. He was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his
strength was failing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!???</span> cried
Dmitri indignantly. He too leapt up. <span class="tei tei-q">???Forgive it, reverend
Father,???</span> he added, addressing the elder. <span class="tei tei-q">???I am not a cultivated
man, and I don't even know how to address you properly, but you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span>
have been deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting
us meet here. All my father wants is a scandal. Why he wants it
only he can tell. He always has some motive. But I believe I
know why??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???They all blame me, all of them!???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his
turn. <span class="tei tei-q">???Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been
blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!???</span> he turned suddenly
to Mi??sov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting
him. <span class="tei tei-q">???They all accuse me of having hidden the children's money
in my boots, and cheated them, but isn't there a court of law?
There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from
your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money
you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left.
Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri
is not a stranger to him. Because they are all against me, while
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some
thousands of which I have documentary proof. The whole town is
echoing with his debaucheries. And where he was stationed before,
he several times spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some
respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its
most secret details. I'll prove it.... Would you believe it, holy
Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorable of young
ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,
formerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and
had the Anna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by
his promise of marriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed
to him, yet before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on
a certain enchantress. And although this enchantress has lived in,
so to speak, civil marriage with a respectable man, yet she is of an
independent character, an unapproachable fortress for everybody,
just like a legal wife???for she is virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is
virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a
golden key, and that's why he is insolent to me now, trying to get
money from me, though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress
already. He's continually borrowing money for the purpose. From
whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Be silent!???</span> cried Dmitri, <span class="tei tei-q">???wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my
presence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span>
should utter a word about her is an outrage, and I won't permit it!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was breathless.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mitya! Mitya!???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing
out a tear. <span class="tei tei-q">???And is your father's blessing nothing to you? If
I curse you, what then????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Shameless hypocrite!???</span> exclaimed Dmitri furiously.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with
others? Gentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honorable man
living here, burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got
into trouble and was discharged from the army, but not publicly,
not by court-martial, with no slur on his honor. And three weeks
ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard in a tavern, dragged him out
into the street and beat him publicly, and all because he is an agent
in a little business of mine.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie!???</span>
Dmitri was trembling with rage. <span class="tei tei-q">???Father, I don't justify my action.
Yes, I confess it publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and
I regret it now, and I'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage.
But this captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom you
call an enchantress, and suggested to her from you, that she should
take I.O.U.'s of mine which were in your possession, and should sue
me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them, if
I persisted in claiming an account from you of my property. Now
you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you
yourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face....
She told me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to
put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her, because
you'd begun to force your attentions upon her; and I know all
about that, too; she laughed at you for that as well???you hear???she
laughed at you as she described it. So here you have this man, this
father who reproaches his profligate son! Gentlemen, forgive my
anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you
together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him if he held
out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he has just
this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady,
for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in
vain, I have made up my mind to show up his game, though he is
my father....???</span>

He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed
with difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except
Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked
austere but waited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale,
not from excitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring
smile lighted up his face; from time to time he raised his
hand, as though to check the storm, and, of course, a gesture from
him would have been enough to end the scene; but he seemed to be
waiting for something and watched them intently as though trying
to make out something which was not perfectly clear to him. At
last Mi??sov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,???</span> he said hotly.
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I did not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom
I had to deal. This must be stopped at once! Believe me, your
reverence, I had no precise knowledge of the details that have just
come to light, I was unwilling to believe them, and I learn for the
first time.... A father is jealous of his son's relations with a
woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the creature to get his
son into prison! This is the company in which I have been forced
to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I was as
much deceived as any one.???</span>

an unnatural voice, <span class="tei tei-q">???if you were not my son I would challenge you

With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments
when they enter so completely into their part that they
tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest, although at that very
moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves,
<span class="tei tei-q">???You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You're acting
now, in spite of your <span class="tei tei-q">???holy???</span> wrath.???</span>

at his father.

nothing but a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???A duel!???</span> yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering

at each syllable. <span class="tei tei-q">???And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi??sov, let me
tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier, and
more honest???you hear???more honest woman than this <span class="tei tei-q">???creature,???</span>
as you have dared to call her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have
abandoned your betrothed for that <span class="tei tei-q">???creature,???</span> so you must yourself

<span class="tei tei-q">???Why is such a man alive????</span> Dmitri, beside himself with rage,

almost deformed. <span class="tei tei-q">???Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling
the earth????</span> He looked round at every one and pointed at the old
man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.

But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way.
Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with
anxiety for the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however,
in supporting him by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards
Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him. Alyosha
thought that he had fallen from weakness, but this was not so. The
elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet till
his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded that he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span>
failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a faint smile
on his lips.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!???</span> he said, bowing on all sides
to his guests.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down
to him???what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, God!???</span>
hid his face in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the
guests flocked out after him, in their confusion not saying good-by,
or bowing to their host. Only the monks went up to him again
for a blessing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic
or what????</span> said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to
reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular.
They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage
at the moment.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen,???</span> Mi??sov answered
at once ill-humoredly, <span class="tei tei-q">???but I will spare myself your company,
Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where's that
monk????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That monk,???</span> that is, the monk who had invited them to dine
with the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as
soon as they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though
he had been waiting for them all the time.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-q">???Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest

said irritably to the monk.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

the relationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your
shuffling. I'll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan,
stay if you like. I'll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires
you to go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to
apologize for the disturbance we've been making....???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what's happened!
Forgive me, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset
besides! And, indeed, I am ashamed. Gentlemen, one man has
the heart of Alexander of Macedon and another the heart of the
little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dog Fido. I am ashamed!
After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, to gobble up the
monastery's sauces? I am ashamed, I can't. You must excuse
me!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The devil only knows, what if he deceives us????</span> thought Mi??sov,
still hesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful
eyes. The latter turned round, and noticing that Mi??sov was
watching him, waved him a kiss.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, are you coming to the Superior????</span> Mi??sov asked Ivan
abruptly.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-q">???Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded
dinner,???</span> said Mi??sov with the same irritability, regardless of the
fact that the monk was listening. <span class="tei tei-q">???We ought, at least, to apologize
for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What
do you think????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father
won't be there,???</span> observed Ivan.

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On
the road through the copse he made one observation however???that
the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they
were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Mi??sov
looked with hatred at Ivan.

Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated
him on his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare
necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt
for a mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk
with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted
on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked
intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.

Alyosha started.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you

And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't
doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not
abandon Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great
sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last
message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.
Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not
only my days but my hours are numbered.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his
mouth quivered.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is it again????</span> Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. <span class="tei tei-q">???The

father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make
no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed,
moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question
was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He
knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had
thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had
made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its
mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the
monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt a
sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear
again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What
he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha
believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him?
How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should
he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery.
Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish.
He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the
hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed
at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go???about
five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but
at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting
for some one.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Are you waiting for me????</span> asked Alyosha, overtaking him.

me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what I
want to ask you.???</span>

what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a

of prophecy, flopping like that. <span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, but it was symbolic,???</span> they'll
say, <span class="tei tei-q">???an allegory,???</span> and the devil knows what all! It'll be remembered
to his glory: <span class="tei tei-q">???He predicted the crime and marked the criminal!???</span>

handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder
at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a
Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to
a disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another,
with their knives in their belts. The three of them are
knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri???despises her,???</span>
said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has
openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her.
There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand
yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's
body, or even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand
that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his
father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest,
he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive.
Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his verse.
Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet
without a thrill???and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help
here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
can't tear himself away.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I understand that,???</span> Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it
out at the first word,???</span> said Rakitin, malignantly. <span class="tei tei-q">???That escaped
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span>
you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a
familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality,
I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're
a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought
about, and what you know already! You are pure, but you've been
down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time.
You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov???no
doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a
sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why
do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has
been begging me to bring you along. <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll pull off his cassock,???</span> she
says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I
wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know,
she's an extraordinary woman, too!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Thank her and say I'm not coming,???</span> said Alyosha, with a
strained smile. <span class="tei tei-q">???Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you
my idea after.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,
brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you
Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your
brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown
motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's
a fraud himself???that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get
Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And
what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender
his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka.
And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness.
Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on
with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing
in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account
he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Mi??sov
called her an <span class="tei tei-q">???abandoned creature.???</span> He's worse than a tom-cat in
love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with
his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly
realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span>
pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And
they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them,
and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of.
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't
marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his
purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money,
but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon
his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and
the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been
the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated,
provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well
come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is
waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry
off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her
dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a
man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't
be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know
as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy
girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of
his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man
who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between
the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so
that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying
himself at your expense.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How do you know? How can you speak so confidently????</span>
Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for

it's suffering he is seeking.???</span>

a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains???you'll
understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did
you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of
the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And
by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out:
<span class="tei tei-q">???I will remember!???</span>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!???(I'm
being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic

freedom, for equality, for fraternity.???</span>

Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
though remembering something, he stopped short.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, that's enough,???</span> he said, with a still more crooked smile.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are
clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your
getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you
are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that
for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.

he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one
after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the
opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in
the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to
go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer,
that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the
owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic
side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping
a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides
and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account,
the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds
and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end
of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing
offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being
an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about

the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span>
wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I

<span class="tei tei-q">???Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman????</span>
Alyosha flushed suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">???I tell you again, I heard that she was a
relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself
you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people
had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your
business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,
is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are.
You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it?
Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the
Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have.
Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've
broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's
shouting out something after them from the steps. And your
father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing.
Bah, and there goes Mi??sov driving away in his carriage. You see,
he's going. And there's old Maximov running!???there must have
been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not
been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been
beaten? It would serve them right!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a
scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse
of a moment.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mi??sov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but
feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's
with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt
that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span>
Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's
cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <span class="tei tei-q">???The monks were not to
blame, in any case,???</span> he reflected, on the steps. <span class="tei tei-q">???And if they're
decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't
argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
them that I've nothing to do with that ??sop,
that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this
affair, just as they have.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and
relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become
much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the
wood and river in question were.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the
Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not
a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether;
they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than
Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing
of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered
with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not
even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there
were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous
thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully
decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were
three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent
mead, and a large glass jug of kvas???both the latter made in
the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no
vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup
made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish
served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these
good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where
he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got
information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious
temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and
nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would
play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span>
to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable,
and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the
contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table
he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any
one else could have influenced him in that.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be
invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Pa??ssy, and one
other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
were already waiting when Mi??sov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The
Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his
guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black
hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed
to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive
his blessing. Mi??sov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and
Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted
and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,???</span> began Mi??sov,
simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor
of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father
Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with
his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ...
in fact, quite unseemly ... as???</span>???he glanced at the monks???<span class="tei tei-q">???your
reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing
that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
place.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Mi??sov completely recovered
his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation
disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a
slight bend of the head, replied:
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might
have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.
All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before
him, with peculiar fervor.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last
prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and
really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father
Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior
in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed
of himself???quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would
be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly
been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it,
when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words
at the elder's: <span class="tei tei-q">???I always feel when I meet people that I am lower
than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play
the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than
I.???</span> He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness.
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been
asked, <span class="tei tei-q">???Why do you hate so and so, so much????</span> And he had answered
them, with his shameless impudence, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll tell you. He has
done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since
I have hated him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating
for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively
quivered. <span class="tei tei-q">???Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,???</span> he
decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed
in the following words, <span class="tei tei-q">???Well, there is no rehabilitating
myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will
show them I don't care what they think???that's all!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned
to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no
clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control
himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of
obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for
which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could
always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that
score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span>
at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving
to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company,
and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
them all boldly in the face. <span class="tei tei-q">???They thought I had gone, and here
I am again,???</span> he cried to the whole room.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at
once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively
scandalous, was about to happen. Mi??sov passed immediately from
the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the
feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No! this I cannot endure!???</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">???I absolutely cannot! and ...
I certainly cannot!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he
was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is it he cannot????</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">???that he absolutely
cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come
in or not? Will you receive me as your guest????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are welcome with all my heart,???</span> answered the Superior.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Gentlemen!???</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">???I venture to beg you most earnestly to
lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family
harmony???with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, no, it is impossible!???</span> cried Mi??sov, beside himself.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible
for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep
with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away,
Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.
You stung him by what you said about family harmony,
Father Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right,
isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you mean me????</span> muttered Maximov, puzzled.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Of course I mean you,???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <span class="tei tei-q">???Who else?
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von
Sohn was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house
of harlotry???I believe that is what such places are called among
you???he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span>
was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the
luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang
songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that
very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is happening? What's this????</span> voices were heard in the
group of monks.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Let us go,???</span> cried Mi??sov, addressing Kalganov.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, excuse me,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another
step into the room. <span class="tei tei-q">???Allow me to finish. There in the cell
you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of
eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Mi??sov, my relation, prefers
to have <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">plus de noblesse que de sinc??rit??</span></span>

sinc??rit?? que de noblesse</span></span>, and???damn the
<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">noblesse</span></span>!
That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though
I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor,
and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in
Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,
Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare,
and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have
been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give
you the last act of the performance. You know how things are
with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so
it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again.
Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a great
sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but
there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be
right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to
confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and
so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one
that I did this and that ... well, you understand what???sometimes
it would not be proper to talk about it???so it is really a scandal!
No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants,
I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod,
and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look
for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors
which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span>
monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed)
that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment
of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament
of confession and so on and so on???absurd charges which had died
away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had
caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the current
of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,
prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not
understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for
on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in
the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind.
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But
as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking
absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience,
and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense.
And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would
be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,
and plunged forward blindly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How disgraceful!???</span> cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Pavlovitch a low bow.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Tut???tut???tut???sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old

the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that
I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you
expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will
come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in
the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a
monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward
up aloft for it???you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too,

table. <span class="tei tei-q">???Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie,

it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Pa??ssy kept obstinately silent. Mi??sov rushed from the
room, and Kalganov after him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not
coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't
come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep
your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my
revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.???</span> He
thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling.
<span class="tei tei-q">???This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost
me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,
against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories
about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of
Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand,
nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get
out of me!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any
great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was
for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he
was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was
time to draw back.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again
spoke impressively:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It is written again, <span class="tei tei-q">???Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor

<span class="tei tei-q">???Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.

Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to
follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see
me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst;

instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We
will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've
cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.???</span> He
went out, shouting and gesticulating.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to
Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alexey!???</span> his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him.
<span class="tei tei-q">???You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow
and mattress, and leave no trace behind.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan
was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to
say good-by to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible
scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode.
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran
up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw
him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put
his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and
clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. <span class="tei tei-q">???I am going
with you!???</span> he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a
look of reckless glee in his face. <span class="tei tei-q">???Take me, too.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There!???</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. <span class="tei tei-q">???Did I not say he
was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why,
how did you tear yourself away? What did you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vonsohn</span></span> there?
And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a
brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you,
brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun.
He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von
Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the
box, von Sohn!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave
Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was
quite by chance he did not fall.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Drive on!???</span> Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you
do that????</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, you are a fellow,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, <span class="tei tei-q">???Why,
it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you
approved of it. Why are you angry now????</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,???</span> Ivan
snapped sullenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???A drop of brandy would be nice now,???</span> he observed sententiously,

Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away
stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the
town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking
old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was
roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all
sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases. There
were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike
them. <span class="tei tei-q">???One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the
evening,???</span> he used to say. It was his habit to send the servants
away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone. The
lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor Pavlovitch
used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen
in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and
summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The
house was built for a large family; there was room for five times
as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story there
was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son
Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory,
and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of
these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said
something already. He was firm and determined and went blindly
and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought by any
reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that it
was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife,
Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her
life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the
serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little
shop in Moscow with their small savings. But Grigory decided then,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span>
once for all, that <span class="tei tei-q">???the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman
is dishonest,???</span> and that they ought not to leave their old master,
whatever he might be, for <span class="tei tei-q">???that was now their duty.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you understand what duty is????</span> he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why
it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,???</span> Marfa answered
firmly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold
your tongue.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch
promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory
knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master.
It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an
obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong
enough <span class="tei tei-q">???in some of the affairs of life,???</span> as he expressed it, he found
himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other
emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them.
There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And
that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most
trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor
Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's
intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a
good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch
was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle
and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained
the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted,
which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a
moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often
cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was
sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious
terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.
<span class="tei tei-q">???My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,???</span> he used to
say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand,
in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and
unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his
secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to
oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with
anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span>
to defend him???from whom? From somebody unknown, but
terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there
was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him
in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange
some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old
servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry,
he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that
Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and
fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch
would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would
soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he
had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and
sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened
to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <span class="tei tei-q">???pierced
his heart???</span> by <span class="tei tei-q">???living with him, seeing everything and blaming
nothing.???</span> Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his
father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt
for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected
devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a
complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family
ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till
then loved nothing but <span class="tei tei-q">???evil.???</span> When Alyosha had left him, he
confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not
till then been willing to learn.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adela??da
Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of
Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna,
the poor <span class="tei tei-q">???crazy woman,???</span> against his master and any one who
chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy
wife had become something sacred to him, so that even now,
twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her
from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,
Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his
words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight
whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love
her, and she knew it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,
cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span>
in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything
without question or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected
him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they
spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the
most necessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory
thought over all his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna
had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her
advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took
it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once,
and then only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's
marriage with Adela??da Ivanovna, the village girls and
women???at that time serfs???were called together before the house
to sing and dance. They were beginning <span class="tei tei-q">???In the Green Meadows,???</span>
when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and
danced <span class="tei tei-q">???the Russian Dance,???</span> not in the village fashion, but as she
had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich
Mi??sov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught
to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his
wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave
her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating
was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God had not blessed them with children. One child was born
but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of
showing it. When Adela??da Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took
Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed
him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost
a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for
which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the
face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his
own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth.
When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The
baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was
not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the
garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen
garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time
Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage
where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including
Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-father, he suddenly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span>
announced that the baby <span class="tei tei-q">???ought not to be christened at all.???</span>
He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing
with dull intentness at the priest.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why not????</span> asked the priest with good-humored surprise.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Because it's a dragon,???</span> muttered Grigory.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???A dragon? What dragon????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grigory did not speak for some time. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's a confusion of nature,???</span>
he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to
say more.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory
prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child
remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long
as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to
notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when,
at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid
the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when
they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and
bowed down to the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention
his child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if
Grigory were not present, she never spoke of it above a whisper.
Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he devoted himself
to <span class="tei tei-q">???religion,???</span> and took to reading the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lives of the Saints</span></span>,
for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his
big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only
perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow
got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <span class="tei tei-q">???the God-fearing
Father Isaac the Syrian,???</span> which he read persistently for
years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing
and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to
the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood.
He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go
over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him
an expression of still greater gravity.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his
deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design,
been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which,
as he said later, had left a <span class="tei tei-q">???stamp???</span> upon his soul. It happened that,
on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>
by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked
her husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like
some one groaning, <span class="tei tei-q">???it might be a woman.???</span> He got up and dressed.
It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he
distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from
the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no
other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong,
high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern,
took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of
his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and
that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the
garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from
the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were
the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he
saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about
the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of
Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house
and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the
baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to
speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,
and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This
Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <span class="tei tei-q">???not five foot within a wee bit,???</span>
as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after
her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy
and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek
expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted,
wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost
black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap
on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits
of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the
ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span>
called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman
with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead.
Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever
she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in
the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially
dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the town,
especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and always
rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter.
But, although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting,
she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and
taking off all that had been given her???kerchief, sheepskin, skirt
or boots???she left them there and walked away barefoot in her
smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor
of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw
Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And
though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young
woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a
breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor
went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her
father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of
the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one
seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of
our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She
would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every
one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a
copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of
the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market,
she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would
stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the
lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything
but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,
where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept
watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles
overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She
scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch
or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences
to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden. She used at least
once a week to turn up <span class="tei tei-q">???at home,???</span> that is at the house of her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span>
father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night,
and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People were amazed
that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to it, and,
although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some of
the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but
that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from
time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have
been proud?
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September
(many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from
the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions.
They passed through the <span class="tei tei-q">???back-way,???</span> which led between the back
gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads
out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were
accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under
the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look
at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.
It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry
whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a
woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance
that it was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was
among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means
impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it,
and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing his
part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain
the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality
he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when
he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and,
with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly
that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of
him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion;
and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The
others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with
the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on,
Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps
it was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But
five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and
sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>
who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a
terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no
other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of
that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still
among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the
father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the
tale, even if there had been any foundation for it. But rumor
pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at
him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not
have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he
was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle
of the officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He
provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded
in bringing some people round to his side. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's the wench's own
fault,???</span> he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict,
who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us,
as he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible,
for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just
at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this
affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy
from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A
well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take
her into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go
out until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over
her, but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day,
and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her
condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained
a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted
over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The
most likely explanation is that it happened naturally???that Lizaveta,
accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow
managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had
leapt down, injuring herself.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran
to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby,
but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home,
and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. <span class="tei tei-q">???A child of God???an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
orphan is akin to all,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???and to us above others. Our
little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son
and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to
which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor).
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it
amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility.
The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later
on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him
Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant,
and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our
story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something
of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention
so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back
to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the
command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But
in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his
way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father
had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way
he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten
to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home
<span class="tei tei-q">???with his mattress and pillow???</span> did not frighten him in the least.
He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely
<span class="tei tei-q">???a flourish???</span> to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in
our town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends,
getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own
crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and
finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of
course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers.
Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span>
next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded
that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt
him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would
want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could
hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without
question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him,
and worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was
the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently
entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to
come and see her about something. This request and the necessity
of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this
feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite
of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was
not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and
what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a
woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life,
from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with
women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He
had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only
seen her two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few
words to her. He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious
girl. It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something
else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension
itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew that.
She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,
though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha
recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments,
a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her
house.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate
a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father.
Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had
a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with
her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri
before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he
could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and
he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span>
he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed
gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the
direction of his terrible lady.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then
across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our
town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And
meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet
forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had
to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a short
cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground. This
meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other
people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted
him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging
to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of
this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with
her daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals'
families in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking
after her sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though
her old mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went
every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which
Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for
soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even
had a long train???a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin,
who always knew everything that was going on in the town. He
had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the
garden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head,
which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite
unexpected.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something,
was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously
afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha
ran up to the hurdle.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,???</span>
Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. <span class="tei tei-q">???Climb in here quickly!
How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span>
the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help
him jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle
with the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well done! Now come along,???</span> said Mitya in an enthusiastic
whisper.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Where????</span> whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself
in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The
garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There's no one here. Why do you whisper????</span> asked Alyosha.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!???</span> cried Dmitri at the top of
his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">???You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here

The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees
only along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees,
maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an
empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was
carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few roubles
for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries and currants
and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden
had been planted lately near the house.

Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.
There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant,
elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green
summer-house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work,
but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows
when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition that it
had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called
von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It was all in decay,
the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled
musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed
in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which
it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span>
brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw
half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.

riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side
by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a
lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many
riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can,
and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure
the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the
ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's
still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul
does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be
on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth
and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him
narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the
mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there

beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The
awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and

of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and
I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss me. She
was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature.
She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought,
poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer
(I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word
to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we
were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how
they glowed with fire???a fire of gentle indignation. This game
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span>
only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months
later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and still,
perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe that
I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires,
and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're blushing; your
eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was
nothing much???wayside blossoms <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">??
la</span></span> Paul de Kock???though the
cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect
album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I
tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them
away. I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough. You
can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense.

From this field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy,
also befouled by flies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although
the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was
something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and
then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me
with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never
told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course???Ivan

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,
like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in
the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be
rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other
ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they
liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike
to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends,
and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't do me
much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with
proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was
really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two
wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left
a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of
four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father
and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate;
the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about
people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than
Agafya???fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn't
bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full
figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not
married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but
was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in <span class="tei tei-q">???that???</span> way,
it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women
quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking frankness,
and she only laughed. Many women like such freedom, and she
was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one
could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived
in her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting
themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general
favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever dressmaker.
She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without asking
for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse.
The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span>
of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained
the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I
arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the
expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty,
who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second
daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second
wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as
I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no money.
She had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations,
but they had come to nothing.</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit,
the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies???two <span class="tei tei-q">???Excellencies???</span>
and a colonel's wife???and all the rest following their
lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor.
She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up
<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">tableaux vivants</span></span>
in aid of distressed governesses. I took no notice, I went
on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the
town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the
battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained
her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an evening
party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her
lips scornfully. <span class="tei tei-q">???Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,???</span> thought I. I
behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I
was conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt
that <span class="tei tei-q">???Katenka???</span> was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a
person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she
had education and intellect, and I had neither. You think I meant
to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself,
because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel it.</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel
put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father
sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed
giving up all claims upon him???settling our accounts, so to speak,
and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't understand
a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till
the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to
make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But never
mind that, we'll talk of it later.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling
me something that interested me immensely. The authorities,
I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected
of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise
for him. And then the commander of the division arrived,
and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was
ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had
enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the
town towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their
backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna,
with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">???Do you know
there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your
father's accounts????</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">??????<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't frighten me!???</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">???Who told you so????</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">??????<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't be uneasy,???</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">???I won't tell any one. You know
I'm as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of <span class="tei tei-q">???possibilities,???</span>
to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your
father, and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve
as a common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me
your young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give
her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.???</span></span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">??????<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, you scoundrel!???</span>???that's what she said. <span class="tei tei-q">???You wicked
scoundrel! How dare you!???</span></span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her
once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple
creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved
like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely adored
their <span class="tei tei-q">???Katya,???</span> thought her far above them, and waited on her, hand
and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I found that
out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course that was
all I wanted.</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion.
The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't
leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the government
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span>
money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill. But I
knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last
four years the money had never been in his hands except when the
Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to a
trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old
widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to
go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return
the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the
fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I heard all about
it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth
and one of the most vicious in the world)???this time, I say, Trifonov
brought nothing back from the fair. The lieutenant-colonel flew
to him. <span class="tei tei-q">???I've never received any money from you, and couldn't
possibly have received any.???</span> That was all the answer he got. So
now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel
round his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All
at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order
to <span class="tei tei-q">???hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.???</span>
He signed the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards),
stood up, saying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom,
loaded his double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot
off his right foot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling
for the trigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had
told her, had her suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room
just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind,
threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling,
but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held
him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home,
it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had
dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up
my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room
stood Katerina Ivanovna.</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen
her in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged
with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most
obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request
were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I
grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span>
me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and round
her mouth I saw uncertainty.</span>

the money!???</span></span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her
voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it
quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,???</span> said Alyosha in
agitation.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened
I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a???Karamazov one. Once
I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with
fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then???a
noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down.
You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another
way then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was
noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity
and sacrifice for her father, and I???a bug! And, scoundrel
as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She
was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous
thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense.
It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I
should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of
pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone
next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so
to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though I'm a
man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice
seemed to whisper in my ear, <span class="tei tei-q">???But when you come to-morrow to
make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her
coachman to kick you out of the yard. <span class="tei tei-q">???Publish it through all
the town,???</span> she would say, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'm not afraid of you.???</span>??????</span> I looked at
the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it
would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now that I
should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed
to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her with a
sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with
a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.</span>

throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no

only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never
happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at
such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for
three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred???that hate which
is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane,
and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep
her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table,
opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles
(it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in
silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the passage,
and, stepping back, made her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most
impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all over, gazed at me
for a second, turned horribly pale???white as a sheet, in fact???and
all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my
feet???not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her
forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing
my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot;
why, I don't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of
course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that
one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn't stab myself. I
only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard???which there
was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in
telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to
glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into
the human heart! Well, so much for that <span class="tei tei-q">???adventure???</span> with Katerina

six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one
action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round
with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the
change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles
was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on
changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I

of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest
relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and
next-of-kin???both died in the same week of small-pox. The old
lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her
one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's favor. But
that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use,
eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked
with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in
Moscow, later.</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred
roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three
days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You
must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. <span class="tei tei-q">???I
love you madly,???</span> she says, <span class="tei tei-q">???even if you don't love me, never mind.
Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way.
I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want
to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.???</span> Alyosha,
I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in
my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure
myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't
mind???that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it
was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears.
One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being
rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I
mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it
slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him
all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her.
Why do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes,
Ivan fell in love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that.
I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one
stupid thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see
what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>
compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like me, especially
after all that has happened here????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not
a man like him.???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???She loves her own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtue</span></em>, not me.???</span> The words broke involuntarily,
and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a
minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the
table violently with his fist.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I swear, Alyosha,???</span> he cried, with intense and genuine anger at
himself; <span class="tei tei-q">???you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ
is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just
now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and
that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly
angel's. That's the tragedy of it???that I know that for certain.
What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And
yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how
he must be cursing nature now???with his intellect, too! To see the
preference given???to whom, to what? To a monster who, though
he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his debaucheries???and
before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man
like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a
girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's
ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of
course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny
will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while
the undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever???his
filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and
where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with
enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use
them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the
back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???Stop, Dmitri,???</span> Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety.
<span class="tei tei-q">???There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed
all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the
engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my
arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine
style. The general's wife blessed us, and???would you believe it????congratulated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span>
Katya. <span class="tei tei-q">???You've made a good choice,???</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">???I see

Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in
Moscow. I told her about myself???sincerely, honorably. She
listened to everything.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible
and with such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world?
Confound it, I have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka,
I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand
that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the
first place to beat her. I had heard, and I know for a fact now, that
that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of
mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me.
They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a glimpse
of her before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about
her old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he's leaving
her a decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money,
that she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span>
she's a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I
stayed. The storm broke???it struck me down like the plague. I'm
plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there
will never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is
accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as
fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I
drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from
here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants
there drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands
flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you
suppose the hero had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I
tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body.
You can see it in her little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and
kissed it, but that was all, I swear! <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll marry you if you like,???</span> she
said, <span class="tei tei-q">???you're a beggar, you know. Say that you won't beat me, and
will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.???</span>
She laughed, and she's laughing still!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as
though he were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And do you really mean to marry her????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the same.
I'll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!???</span> he cried. He stopped
short before him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking
him violently. <span class="tei tei-q">???Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is all
delirium, senseless delirium, for there's a tragedy here. Let me tell
you, Alexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded passions,
but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can
be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket.
That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina
Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I
suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of
the province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna
in Moscow, so that nothing should be known of it in the town here.
So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to
see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards
I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the
post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring
the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it. I've forgotten it. Now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span>
what do you think you're going to her to-day to say? <span class="tei tei-q">???He sends his
compliments,???</span> and she'll ask you, <span class="tei tei-q">???What about the money????</span> You
might still have said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">???He's a degraded sensualist, and a low
creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money
then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control
himself.???</span> But still you might have added, <span class="tei tei-q">???He isn't a thief though.
Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to
Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say <span class="tei tei-q">???he sends his compliments.???</span>??????</span>
But, as it is, she will ask, <span class="tei tei-q">???But where is the money????</span>??????</span>

back only three out of the twenty-eight thousand, and he'll draw
my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many of his sins. For

(underline <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in earnest</span></em>) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking,
and really means to marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the
cat. And do you suppose he's going to give me money to help to
bring that about when he's crazy about her himself? And that's
not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the
last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank,
changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope,
sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see
how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: <span class="tei tei-q">???To my
angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.???</span> He scrawled it himself
in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's there
except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now
he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he
hopes she'll come for the money. He has sent her word of it, and
she has sent him word that perhaps she'll come. And if she does
go to the old man, can I marry her after that? You understand

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was
a dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the
drawing-room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned
ostentation. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered
in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the
windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of
old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper,
which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits???one
of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty
years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In
the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which
a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional
purposes as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span>
bed very late, at three or four o'clock in the morning, and would
wander about the room at night or sit in an arm-chair, thinking.
This had become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in
the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov
remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves
had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with
brandy after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The
servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the
gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor
Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter. Before he entered the
room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so well, and could
tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached the good-humored
stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here he is! Here he is!???</span> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted
at seeing Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten
dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping
the fast. But would you like some? No; I'd better give you
some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the
second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look sharp!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,???</span> said Fyodor Pavlovitch,
beaming. <span class="tei tei-q">???But stay???have you dined????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes,???</span> answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece
of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want
warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making.
My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at
fish soup, too. You must come one day and have some fish soup.
Let me know beforehand.... But, stay; didn't I tell you this
morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all?
Have you brought your mattress? He he he!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, I haven't,???</span> said Alyosha, smiling, too.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning,
weren't you? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex
you. Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight
in the face and laughs? It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span>
of him. Alyosha, let me give you my blessing???a father's blessing.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his
mind.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, no,???</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll just make the sign of the cross over you,
for now. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line,
too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us
here???and how he talks! How he talks!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a
young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and
taciturn. Not that he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he
was conceited and seemed to despise everybody.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was
brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up <span class="tei tei-q">???with no
sense of gratitude,???</span> as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly
boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully. In his childhood
he was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with
great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were
a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as
though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the greatest
secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a
sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a
week. <span class="tei tei-q">???He doesn't care for you or me, the monster,???</span> Grigory used
to say to Marfa, <span class="tei tei-q">???and he doesn't care for any one. Are you a human
being????</span> he said, addressing the boy directly. <span class="tei tei-q">???You're not a
human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house.<span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span>
That's what you are.???</span> Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could
never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to read and
write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the
Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or
third lesson the boy suddenly grinned.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What's that for????</span> asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly
from under his spectacles.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun,
moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from
on the first day????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his
teacher. There was something positively condescending in his expression.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span>
Grigory could not restrain himself. <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll show you
where!???</span> he cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The
boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his corner
again for some days. A week later he had his first attack of the
disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life???epilepsy.
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed
changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though
he never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met
him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the
boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his
illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and
tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The fits
occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals.
The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very
severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal
punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs
to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a
time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch
noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles
through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books???over
a hundred???but no one ever saw him reading. He at once
gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. <span class="tei tei-q">???Come, read. You
shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging
about the courtyard. Come, read this,???</span> and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave
him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka</span></span>.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and
ended by frowning.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why? Isn't it funny????</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Smerdyakov did not speak.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Answer, stupid!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's all untrue,???</span> mumbled the boy, with a grin.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay,
here's Smaragdov's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Universal History</span></span>. That's all true. Read
that.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov.
He thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch
that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary
fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span>
spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a
spoonful and hold it to the light.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is it? A beetle????</span> Grigory would ask.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???A fly, perhaps,???</span> observed Marfa.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with
his bread, his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece
on his fork to the light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after
long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!???</span> Grigory muttered, looking
at him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov
he determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow
to be trained. He spent some years there and came back remarkably
changed in appearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his
age. His face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate.
In character he seemed almost exactly the same as before he
went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest
inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard
afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little interest
for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice
of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and
displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from
Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed
his clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very
fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish,
so that they shone like mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook.
Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which
Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things.
But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for
men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor
Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming
more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked,
which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why are your fits getting worse????</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch,
looking askance at his new cook. <span class="tei tei-q">???Would you like to get married?
Shall I find you a wife????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply.
Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span>
thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened
once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in
the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only
just received. He only missed them next day, and was just hastening
to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table.
Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and
brought them in the day before.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,???</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch
said shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he
not only believed in his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking
for him, although the young man looked as morosely at him as at
every one and was always silent. He rarely spoke. If it had occurred
to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was
interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have been impossible
to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop
suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand
still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his
face would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection,
but only a sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by
the painter Kramskoy, called <span class="tei tei-q">???Contemplation.???</span> There is a forest in
winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude,
stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it
were, lost in thought. Yet he is not thinking; he is <span class="tei tei-q">???contemplating.???</span>
If any one touched him he would start and look at one as
though awakening and bewildered. It's true he would come to
himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been thinking
about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden
within himself, the impression which had dominated him during
the period of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and
no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously.
How and why, of course, he does not know either. He may suddenly,
after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon everything
and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul's salvation,
or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native village, and perhaps
do both. There are a good many <span class="tei tei-q">???contemplatives???</span> among the
peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he
probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing
why.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a
strange one. Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases,
and had heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of
a Russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day.
This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia,
and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he did
not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny
his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and
glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor
Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and
talk, if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly
good-humored and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening
to the story, he observed that they ought to make a saint of a
soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery. <span class="tei tei-q">???That
would make the people flock, and bring the money in.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means
touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment
Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov
often waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's
arrival in our town he had done so every day.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What are you grinning at????</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching
the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, my opinion is,???</span> Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly
in a loud voice, <span class="tei tei-q">???that if that laudable soldier's exploit was
so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it
if he had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of
Christ and his own christening, to save by that same his life, for
good deeds, by which, in the course of years to expiate his cowardice.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that
you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,???</span> put in
Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch,
as we have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We're on your subject, your subject,???</span> he chuckled gleefully,
making Alyosha sit down to listen.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for
this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,???</span>
Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How do you mean <span class="tei tei-q">???according to justice???</span>????</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch
cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He's a rascal, that's what he is!???</span> burst from Grigory. He looked
Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,???</span>
answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. <span class="tei tei-q">???You'd better consider
yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the
Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God
and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by
my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,???</span>
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Soup-maker!???</span> muttered Grigory contemptuously.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for
yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as
I say to those enemies, <span class="tei tei-q">???No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my
true God,???</span> then at once, by God's high judgment, I become immediately
and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the
Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that
very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying
it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off. Is that
so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware
of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the
questions.

<span class="tei tei-q">???You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time,
and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the very

exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes
of no avail. Isn't that so????</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the
enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian,
seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my
Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to
utter a word to the enemy. And if I have already been discharged,
in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held responsible
as a Christian in the other world for having denied Christ, when,
through the very thought alone, before denying Him I had been
relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a Christian, then
I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who
will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even
in heaven, for not having been born a Christian? And who would
punish him for that, considering that you can't take two skins off
one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if He did make the
Tatar responsible, when he dies would give him the smallest possible
punishment, I imagine (since he must be punished), judging that
he is not to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen,
from heathen parents. The Lord God can't surely take a Tatar and
say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span>
would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth
tell a lie, even in one word????</span>

Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes
nearly starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand
what was said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and
stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall.
Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off into his shrill
laugh.

you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your
faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in

<span class="tei tei-q">???Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,???</span> Smerdyakov went on,
staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous
to the vanquished foe. <span class="tei tei-q">???Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch;
it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a
mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move
without the least delay at your bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you
are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain,
not to move into the sea for that's a long way off, but even
to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden.
You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just
where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory
Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only
abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one
in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span>
person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea???except
perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and
they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the
Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them???if so it be, if all the
rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population
of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert,
and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them?
And so I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall
be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.???</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,???</span> said Alyosha
firmly and gravely.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert,

<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, that's purely Russian,???</span> said Alyosha smiling.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you
to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only
from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are too much for
us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time,
only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to
get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins. While you have
denied your faith to your enemies when you'd nothing else to think
about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes
a sin.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,
that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had
believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really
would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith,
and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course,
it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should only have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span>
had to say at that instant to the mountain, <span class="tei tei-q">???Move and crush the
tormentor,???</span> and it would have moved and at the very instant have
crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have walked away as
though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God. But,
suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that
mountain, <span class="tei tei-q">???Crush these tormentors,???</span> and it hadn't crushed them,
how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such
a dread hour of mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know
already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of
Heaven (for since the mountain had not moved at my word, they
could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and there could
be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come). So
why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no good
purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my
back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or
at my cry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over
one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would
not be able to think at all. And, therefore, how should I be particularly
to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or
here, I should, at least, save my skin. And so trusting fully in the
grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether
forgiven.???</span>

anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh? Alyosha, are
you blushing? Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't stay to
dinner at the Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at
Mokroe. Alyosha, don't be angry that I offended your Superior this
morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then,
of course, I'm to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if
there isn't a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's
not enough to cut their heads off, for they keep back progress.
Would you believe it, Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No,

such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my

stories.... The year before last he invited us to tea, tea with
liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began telling us about
old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially how he once
cured a paralyzed woman. <span class="tei tei-q">???If my legs were not bad I know a

The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness
when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to
pick a quarrel and to assert himself.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't

bring you a present. I'll show you a little wench there. I've had
my eye on her a long time. She's still running about bare-foot.

And he kissed his hand with a smack.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???To my thinking,???</span> he revived at once, seeming to grow sober
the instant he touched on his favorite topic. <span class="tei tei-q">???To my thinking ...
Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my
thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life???that's
been my rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand
it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of
your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something
devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find
in any other. Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point!
That's a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very
fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you
understand that? Even in <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">vieilles
filles</span></span>, even in them you may discover
something that makes you simply wonder that men have been
such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them. Bare-footed
girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn't
you know that? You must astound them till they're fascinated,
upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a
little slut. It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will
be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little
maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's
needed for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to
surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention
to her at all, but all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion
to her, crawl on my knees, kiss her feet, and I always, always???I
remember it as though it were to-day???reduced her to that
tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh. It was peculiar to her.
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that. The next day
she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh was not
a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That's
the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky???he
was a handsome fellow, and rich???used to like to come here
and hang about her???suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her
presence. And she???such a mild sheep???why, I thought she would
have knocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! <span class="tei tei-q">???You're
beaten, beaten now,???</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">???You've taken a blow from him.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span>
You have been trying to sell me to him,???</span> she said.... <span class="tei tei-q">???And how
dared he strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me
again, never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!???</span>...
I took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses. The
holy Fathers prayed her back to reason. But I swear, by God,
Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only once, perhaps,
in the first year; then she was very fond of praying. She used to
keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out
of her room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her, thought I!
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here,???</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">???you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it
down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly
and nothing will happen to me for it!???</span>... When she saw it, good
Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung
her hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all
over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha,
what's the matter????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun
speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over
Alyosha's face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips
quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing,
till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha.
Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly
repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his
mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in
them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical
paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance
to his mother particularly impressed the old man.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used
to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth,
that's what I used to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his
mother,???</span> he muttered to Ivan.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she
not????</span> said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old
man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange
had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have
escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's mother actually was the
mother of Ivan too.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Your mother????</span> he muttered, not understanding. <span class="tei tei-q">???What do
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span>
you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?...
Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind
has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking,
Ivan.... He he he!???</span> He stopped. A broad, drunken, half-senseless
grin overspread his face.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the
hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri
burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let him get at me!???</span> he
screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri.
They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing
to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch
some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri
stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory
ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of
the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the
closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance,
so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,
Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him
back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory
with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping
over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling
at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She's here!???</span> shouted Dmitri. <span class="tei tei-q">???I saw her turn towards the house
just now, but I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is she????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That shout, <span class="tei tei-q">???She's here!???</span> produced an indescribable effect on
Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Hold him! Hold him!???</span> he cried, and dashed after Dmitri.
Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed
stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third
room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash:
it was a large glass vase???not an expensive one???on a marble pedestal
which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???At him!???</span> shouted the old man. <span class="tei tei-q">???Help!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing
him back.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright,???</span> Ivan
cried wrathfully at his father.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He
said he saw her himself, running.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time,
and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.
He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come,???</span> cried Ivan.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But she may have come by that other entrance.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of
course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was
in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all the rooms
were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor
have run out anywhere.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Hold him!???</span> shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him
again. <span class="tei tei-q">???He's been stealing money in my bedroom.???</span> And tearing
himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up
both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts
of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung
him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times
with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan,
though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and
with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his
slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Madman! You've killed him!???</span> cried Ivan.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Serve him right!???</span> shouted Dmitri breathlessly. <span class="tei tei-q">???If I haven't
killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect him!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Dmitri! Go away at once!???</span> cried Alyosha commandingly.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here
just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence
from the lane. I shouted, she ran away.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I saw her.... So she must ... I'll find out at once

the money now. But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure
to say, <span class="tei tei-q">???He sends his compliments to you!???</span> Compliments, his compliments!
Just compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to
her.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated
him in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was
conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still
fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri
looked at him with hatred as he went out.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I don't repent shedding your blood!???</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">???Beware, old
man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you,
and disown you altogether.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He ran out of the room.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!???</span> the
old man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his
finger.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, she's not here, you old lunatic!???</span> Ivan shouted at him angrily.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here, he's fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed,
and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his
head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the
blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his
head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room.
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase,
while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed,

gave you a terrible blow???on the head.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Grigory.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have
murdered him. It wouldn't take much to do for ??sop, would it????</span>
whispered Ivan to Alyosha.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha shuddered.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now.
Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun
to ache.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind
the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened
his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering
and meditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary
excitement.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alyosha,???</span> he whispered apprehensively, <span class="tei tei-q">???where's Ivan????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood
on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his
nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead
there was a rather large crimson bruise.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm
afraid of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're
the only one I'm not afraid of....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend
you.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My
angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She won't marry him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more
comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span>
Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively
glittered in his eyes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just
now,???</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">???Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll
let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning,
don't be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha,
comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You're still asking whether she has been here or not????</span> Alyosha
said sorrowfully.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to
Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her;
see for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh?
What? Can you????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???If I see her I'll ask her,???</span> Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, she won't tell you,???</span> the old man interrupted, <span class="tei tei-q">???she's a rogue.
She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants. She's a deceitful,
shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you mustn't!???</span>

Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at
the gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his
note-book. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was
conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,???</span>
said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete
surprise to Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,???</span> answered Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">???I
may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But you're going to her now, anyway? For that <span class="tei tei-q">???compliments
and farewell,???</span>??????</span> said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part
of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say
that he???well, in fact???takes his leave of her????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Brother, how will all this horror end between father and
Dmitri????</span> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle
out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old
man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look
at other men and decide which is worthy to live????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often
decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And
as for rights???who has not the right to wish????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Not for another man's death????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since
all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring
to what I said just now???that one reptile will devour the other?
In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable
of shedding ??sop's blood, murdering him, eh????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my
mind. I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Thanks, if only for that,???</span> smiled Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">???Be sure, I should always
defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in
this case. Good-by till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't
look on me as a villain,???</span> he added with a smile.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha
felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and
that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha left his father's house feeling even more exhausted
and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind
too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid
to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea
from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He
felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known
till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the
fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father
and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had
himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them
face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy,
terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It
appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so
than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was something
positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him,
which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt
for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women?
Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's
in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find
guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously
more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was
decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and
losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover,
told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just
taken place with his father.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha
entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street
occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span>
two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was that
aunt of her half-sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her
in her father's house when she came from boarding-school. The
other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in
straitened circumstances. It was said that they both gave way
in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept them
with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no
one but her benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept
by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice
a week a full account of all her doings.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened
the door to him to take his name up, it was evident that they were
already aware of his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the
window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying
footsteps and rustling skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had
run out of the room.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such
excitement. He was conducted however to the drawing-room at
once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all
in provincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and
little tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on
the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window.
It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made out a silk mantle
thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just been
sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups
of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another
with sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and
frowned. But at that instant the porti??re was raised, and with
rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out
both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight. At the
same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them
on the table.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply
praying for you all day! Sit down.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when,
three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina
Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her. There had been
no conversation between them at that interview, however. Supposing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span>
Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the
time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent, but he had
seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the imperiousness,
proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl. And all that
was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He
thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with
her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in
the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his
brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could
not be loved for long. He expressed this thought almost plainly
to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother besought and insisted
that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You'll be happy with her, but perhaps???not tranquilly happy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They
don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won't
always be happy with her.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry
with himself for having yielded to his brother's entreaties and put
such <span class="tei tei-q">???foolish???</span> ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as
awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed
too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman. It
was with the more amazement that he felt now, at the first glance
at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been
utterly mistaken. This time her face was beaming with spontaneous
good-natured kindliness, and direct warm-hearted sincerity. The
<span class="tei tei-q">???pride and haughtiness,???</span> which had struck Alyosha so much before,
was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of
bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance,
at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in relation to
the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps
already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite
of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the
future. Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in
his thoughts. He was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides
all this, he noticed at her first words that she was in great
excitement, an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost
approaching ecstasy.

want from you. I want to know your own last impression of him.
I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely even (oh, as
coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and of
his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps
be better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does
not want to come to me. Do you understand what I want from
you? Now, tell me simply, tell me every word of the message he

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me
two or three times not to forget to say so.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your
help. I'll tell you what I think, and you must simply say whether
it's right or not. Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in
passing, without insisting on your repeating the words, without
emphasizing them, that would be the end of everything! But if he
particularly insisted on those words, if he particularly told you not
to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he was in excitement,
beside himself. He had made his decision and was frightened at it.
He wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but leaping
headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply
bravado.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<span class="tei tei-q">???He did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's

in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape
and salvation for his brother. <span class="tei tei-q">???But do you know about the money????</span>
he added, and suddenly broke off.

hadn't sent the money, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that
he was still in need of money. My only object in all this was that
he should know to whom to turn, and who was his true friend.
No, he won't recognize that I am his truest friend; he won't know
me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I've been tormented all
the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed
to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel
ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people's knowing,
but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without
shame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready
to bear for his sake? Why, why doesn't he know me? How dare
he not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him
for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed. And here he fears
that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn't afraid to be open
with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don't deserve the
same????</span>

The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I must tell you,???</span> Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, <span class="tei tei-q">???what
happened just now between him and my father.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to
get the money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and
after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take
his compliments and farewell. <span class="tei tei-q">???He went to that woman,???</span> Alyosha
added softly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman?
Does he think I can't? But he won't marry her,???</span> she suddenly
laughed nervously. <span class="tei tei-q">???Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov?
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span>
It's passion, not love. He won't marry her because she
won't marry him.???</span> Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He may marry her,???</span> said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He won't marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you
know that? Do you know that????</span> Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed
suddenly with extraordinary warmth. <span class="tei tei-q">???She is one of the most fantastic
of fantastic creatures. I know how bewitching she is, but I
know too that she is kind, firm and noble. Why do you look at
me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at
my words, perhaps you don't believe me? Agrafena Alexandrovna,
my angel!???</span> she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the next
room, <span class="tei tei-q">???come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He
knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,???</span>
said a soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The porti??re was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming,
came up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha.
He fixed his eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she
was, that awful woman, the <span class="tei tei-q">???beast,???</span> as Ivan had called her half an
hour before. And yet one would have thought the creature standing
before him most simple and ordinary, a good-natured, kind woman,
handsome certainly, but so like other handsome ordinary women!
It is true she was very, very good-looking with that Russian beauty
so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall woman,
though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was exceptionally
tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless, movements,
softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her voice. She
moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step, but
noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She
sank softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk
dress, and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders
in a costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old,
and her face looked exactly that age. She was very white in the
face, with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The modeling of her
face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle
forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower
lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. But her magnificent,
abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span>
and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have
made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd
in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long
after. What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of
childlike good nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look
of childish delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight
and seeming to expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding
curiosity. The light in her eyes gladdened the soul???Alyosha
felt that. There was something else in her which he could not
understand, or would not have been able to define, and which yet
perhaps unconsciously affected him. It was that softness, that
voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that catlike noiselessness.
Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl could be seen
full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her figure
suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in somewhat
exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs
of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this
fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of
thirty, would <span class="tei tei-q">???spread???</span>; that the face would become puffy, and that
wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the
eyes; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps???in fact,
that it was the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so
often met with in Russian women. Alyosha, of course, did not
think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he wondered with
an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she drawled
in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation
of the syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that
showed bad education and a false idea of good manners. And yet
this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost
incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression
of her face, the soft, babyish joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna
at once made her sit down in an arm-chair facing Alyosha, and
ecstatically kissed her several times on her smiling lips. She seemed
quite in love with her.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,???</span> she said
rapturously. <span class="tei tei-q">???I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to
her, but I'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span>
knew we should settle everything together???everything. My heart
told me so???I was begged not to take the step, but I foresaw it
would be a way out of the difficulty, and I was not mistaken.
Grushenka has explained everything to me, told me all she means
to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace
and joy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,???</span> drawled
Grushenka in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming
smile of delight.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch!
Disdain you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks
as though it were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and
more. Look how she laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one's
heart good to see the angel.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running
down him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am
not at all worthy of your kindness.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Not worthy! She's not worthy of it!???</span> Katerina Ivanovna cried
again with the same warmth. <span class="tei tei-q">???You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
we're fanciful, we're self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our
little heart. We're noble, we're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let
me tell you. We have only been unfortunate. We were too ready
to make every sacrifice for an unworthy, perhaps, or fickle man.
There was one man???one, an officer too, we loved him, we sacrificed
everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago, and he has
forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has written,
he is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him, none but
him, all this time, and we've loved him all our life! He will come,
and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she's
been wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her
favor? Only that bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her
father, her friend, her protector. He found her then in despair, in
agony, deserted by the man she loved. She was ready to drown herself
then, but the old merchant saved her???saved her!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a
great hurry about everything,???</span> Grushenka drawled again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span>
defend you? Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that
charming soft little hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It
has brought me happiness and has lifted me up, and I'm going to
kiss it, outside and inside, here, here, here!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather
fat, hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand
with a charming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the <span class="tei tei-q">???sweet
young lady,???</span> and obviously liked having her hand kissed.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,???</span> thought Alyosha. He
blushed. He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand
like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you think I meant to make you blush????</span> said Katerina Ivanovna,
somewhat surprised. <span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, my dear, how little you understand
me!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young
lady. Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart;
I will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch
that day simply for fun.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll
explain it all to him. You'll break to him that you have long loved
another man, who is now offering you his hand.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you
kept talking about that. I didn't give you my word.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Then I didn't quite understand you,???</span> said Katerina Ivanovna
slowly, turning a little pale. <span class="tei tei-q">???You promised??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,???</span> Grushenka interrupted
softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression.
<span class="tei tei-q">???You see at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I
am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may
have made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking:
I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much once???liked
him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him
to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Just now you said???something quite different,???</span> Katerina Ivanovna
whispered faintly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span>
creature. Only think what he's gone through on my account!
What if when I go home I feel sorry for him? What then????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I never expected??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with
me! Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now
you know my character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic
lady,???</span> she said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina
Ivanovna's hand.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you
did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours
three hundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass.
And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave
entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God
wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand???what
a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible
beauty!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object
indeed of <span class="tei tei-q">???being even???</span> with her in kisses.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with
timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her
bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently
into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted,
confiding expression, the same bright gayety.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She's perhaps too na??ve,???</span> thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a
gleam of hope.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the <span class="tei tei-q">???sweet hand.???</span>
She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three
minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you know, angel lady,???</span> she suddenly drawled in an even
more soft and sugary voice, <span class="tei tei-q">???do you know, after all, I think I won't
kiss your hand????</span> And she laughed a little merry laugh.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???As you please. What's the matter with you????</span> said Katerina
Ivanovna, starting suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand,
but I didn't kiss yours.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness
at Katerina Ivanovna.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Insolent creature!???</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span>
grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from
her seat.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Grushenka too got up, but without haste.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss
yours at all. And how he will laugh!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Vile slut! Go away!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming
for you, dear young lady, a word like that.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Go away! You're a creature for sale!???</span> screamed Katerina
Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for
money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but
Alyosha held her with all his strength.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll
go away???she'll go at once.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry,
and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I will go away,???</span> said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the
sofa. <span class="tei tei-q">???Alyosha, darling, see me home!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Go away???go away, make haste!???</span> cried Alyosha, clasping his
hands imploringly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story
to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha.
See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out
of the house, laughing musically.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and
was shaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I warned you,???</span> said the elder of her aunts. <span class="tei tei-q">???I tried to prevent
your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a
thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse
than any of them. You are too self-willed.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She's a tigress!???</span> yelled Katerina Ivanovna. <span class="tei tei-q">???Why did you hold
me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her???beaten her!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did
not care to, indeed.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha withdrew towards the door.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But, my God!???</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands.
<span class="tei tei-q">???He! He! He could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he
told that creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! <span class="tei tei-q">???You
brought your beauty for sale, dear young lady.???</span> She knows it!
Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word.
His heart ached.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for
me! To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't
condemn me. Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself
now!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept
as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame
Hohlakov; it's been left with us since dinner-time.???</span>

Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it,
almost unconsciously, into his pocket.

It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the
town to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road,
at that hour deserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see
anything clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads
half-way. A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the
cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure
moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:

Father's blood just now.???</span> (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on
the verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to
snap in his soul.) <span class="tei tei-q">???You almost killed him???cursed him???and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what
clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting
for you. And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in
misery any longer, what is there to wait for? Here I have a willow,
a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute,
and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonoring
it with my vile presence? And then I heard you coming???Heavens,
it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So there is
a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little
brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only
one I love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that
moment that I thought, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll fall on his neck at once.???</span> Then a stupid
idea struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted,
like a fool, <span class="tei tei-q">???Your money!???</span> Forgive my foolery???it was only nonsense,
and there's nothing unseemly in my soul.... Damn it all,
tell me what's happened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me,
don't spare me! Was she furious????</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There???I

<span class="tei tei-q">???Both? Whom????</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">???Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri was struck dumb.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Impossible!???</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">???You're raving! Grushenka with her????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he
went in to Katerina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his
story. He can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively,
but he seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action
of significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his own
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span>
sensations. Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him with a terrible
fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he understood it all,
and had grasped every point. But as the story went on, his face
became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He scowled, he clenched
his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more rigid, more concentrated,
more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible rapidity, his
wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips parted,
and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous
laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he
could not speak.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she ran
away!???</span> he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight
it might have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. <span class="tei tei-q">???So
the other one called her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought
to be flogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That's just
what I think; she ought to have been long ago. It's like this,
brother, let her be punished, but I must get better first. I understand
the queen of impudence. That's her all over! You saw her
all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's magnificent in
her own line! So she ran home? I'll go???ah???I'll run to her!
Alyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But Katerina Ivanovna!???</span> exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done before!
It's a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is,
of the five! What a thing to do! That's just like Katya, who was
not afraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly
insult on a generous impulse to save her father! But the pride, the
recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say
that aunt tried to stop her? That aunt, you know, is overbearing,
herself. She's the sister of the general's widow in Moscow, and even
more stuck-up than she. But her husband was caught stealing
government money. He lost everything, his estate and all, and the
proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn't raised them since. So
she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to her! She
thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way
to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and
she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault
is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span>
with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that's
to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion???because
it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em> dream, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em> delusion! Alyosha, darling, how
did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your
cassock and run? Ha ha ha!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted
Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she
flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in
secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that
insult????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as
it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's
humiliation.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Bah!???</span> Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with
his hand. He only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told
him of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: <span class="tei tei-q">???Your brother is
a scoundrel!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that <span class="tei tei-q">???fatal day,???</span>
as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time
at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was
sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's
image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I
remember, she cried herself.... Damn it all! But it's bound to
be so now.... Then she cried, but now <span class="tei tei-q">???the dagger in the heart???</span>!
That's how women are.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He looked down and sank into thought.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!???</span> he said suddenly,
in a gloomy voice. <span class="tei tei-q">???It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm
a scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort.
Come, that's enough. Good-by. It's no use talking! It's not
amusing. You go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see
you again except as a last resource. Good-by, Alexey!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without
raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly
towards the town.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away
so abruptly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!???</span> cried Dmitri,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span>
suddenly turning back. <span class="tei tei-q">???Look at me. Look at me well. You see
here, here???there's terrible disgrace in store for me.???</span> (As he said
<span class="tei tei-q">???here,???</span> Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air, as
though the dishonor lay precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a
pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) <span class="tei tei-q">???You know me now,
a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've never
done anything before and never shall again, anything that can compare
in baseness with the dishonor which I bear now at this very
minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass, though
I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it through, note
that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I shan't stop
it. I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you this, because
even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if I do,
I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I
shan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear
witness that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction!
No need to explain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley
and the she-devil. Good-by. Don't pray for me, I'm not
worth it. And there's no need, no need at all.... I don't need it!
Away!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards
the monastery.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying????</span> he
wondered wildly. <span class="tei tei-q">???Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I
shall look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean????</span>
</p><br>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%"></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the
hermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted
at that hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into
Father Zossima's cell.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the
world? Here was peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion,
there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went
astray at once....???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Pa??ssy, who
came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt
with alarm that he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual
discourse with the brothers could not take place that day. As a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span>
rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father
Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day, their
sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if there had
been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved, reconciled,
exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them. It was
against this general <span class="tei tei-q">???confession???</span> that the opponents of <span class="tei tei-q">???elders???</span> protested,
maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of
confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different thing.
They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions
attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led
to sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the
elder, and went against their own will because every one went, and
for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People
said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll confess
I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,???</span>
simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew that this
actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among
the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from
relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read
by him before those to whom they were addressed.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in
good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance.
But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much
that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more
experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that
<span class="tei tei-q">???for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation,
such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of
great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and
repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering
the monastery???their proper place is in the world. Even in the
temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no
good taking it too much into account.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,???</span> Father Pa??ssy
whispered to Alyosha, as he blessed him. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's difficult to rouse
him. And he must not be roused. He waked up for five minutes,
sent his blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him
at night. He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning.
He remembered you, Alexey. He asked whether you had gone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span>
away, and was told that you were in the town. <span class="tei tei-q">???I blessed him for
that work,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???his place is there, not here, for awhile.???</span> Those
were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with
anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it
that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world?
He must have foreseen something in your destiny! Understand,
Alexey, that if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty
laid upon you by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and
worldly pleasures.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Pa??ssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father
Zossima was dying, though he might live another day or two.
Alyosha firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to
his father, the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not
leave the monastery next day, but would remain with his elder to
the end. His heart glowed with love, and he reproached himself
bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him whom
he had left in the monastery on his deathbed, and whom he honored
above every one in the world. He went into Father Zossima's bedroom,
knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder, who
slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing
and a peaceful face.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had
received his guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay
down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used
as a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which
his father had shouted to him that morning, he had long forgotten
to lie on. He took off his cassock, which he used as a covering. But
before going to bed, he fell on his knees and prayed a long time.
In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his darkness
but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always visited his
soul after the praise and adoration, of which his evening prayer
usually consisted. That joy always brought him light untroubled
sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the little
pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina Ivanovna's.
He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some hesitation,
he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by
Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at
him before the elder in the morning.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alexey Fyodorovitch,???</span> she wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">???I am writing to you without

But I cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung
up in my heart, and this no one but us two must know for a time.
But how am I to say what I want so much to tell you? Paper, they
say, does not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's
blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've
loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you
were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you
all my life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass
them together till our old age. Of course, on condition that you
will leave the monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time
fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I

you won't believe my letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you've
any pity for me, when you come to-morrow, don't look me straight

Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>
thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He
started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he
laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the
note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation
in his heart passed at once. <span class="tei tei-q">???God, have mercy upon all of them,
have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set
them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according

Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima
woke up feeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of
bed and sit up in a chair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked
very tired, yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of
gayety, kindness and cordiality. <span class="tei tei-q">???Maybe I shall not live through
the coming day,???</span> he said to Alyosha. Then he desired to confess
and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to Father
Pa??ssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction
followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled
up by the inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight.
People began coming from the monastery. After the service was
over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one. As the
cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for
others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his
arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his voice was
weak, it was fairly steady.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been

tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear
Fathers and brothers,???</span> he jested, looking with emotion at the group
round him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to
them. But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly
steady, his speech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span>
things, he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything
he had not said in his life, and not simply for the sake of
instructing them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and
all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more in his life to open his
whole heart.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Love one another, Fathers,???</span> said Father Zossima, as far as
Alyosha could remember afterwards. <span class="tei tei-q">???Love God's people. Because
we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no
holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the
very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he
is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer
the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize
that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he
realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible
to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national
and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For
know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for
all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general
sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and
every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the
monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men,
but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge,
our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love.
Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole
world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your
tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess
your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even
when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions
with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither
to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who
insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the
teachers of evil, the materialists???and I mean not only the good
ones???for there are many good ones among them, especially in our
day???hate not even the wicked ones. Remember them in your
prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for
them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not in
pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all
men.... Love God's people, let not strangers draw away the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span>
flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride,
or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and
draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ...
be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver,
do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise
it on high.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported
his words afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though
to take breath, and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of
ecstasy. They heard him with emotion, though many wondered at
his words and found them obscure.... Afterwards all remembered
those words.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was
struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who
were crowding about it. This anticipation showed itself in some by
anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that
some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death.
Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but
even the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father
Pa??ssy's face looked the gravest of all.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin,
who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from
Madame Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and
very opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who
had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing,
there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow,
called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for
the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk,
and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima
had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to
pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery.
He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added,
<span class="tei tei-q">???as though reading the book of the future???</span> (this was Madame
Hohlakov's expression), words of comfort: <span class="tei tei-q">???that her son Vassya
was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly
or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.???</span> And
<span class="tei tei-q">???Would you believe it????</span> exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically,
<span class="tei tei-q">???the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>
that.???</span> Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave
her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was
not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg,
Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an
official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped
<span class="tei tei-q">???to embrace his mother.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new
<span class="tei tei-q">???miracle of prediction???</span> to the Superior and all the brotherhood.
<span class="tei tei-q">???All, all, ought to know of it!???</span> she concluded. The letter had been
written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every
line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew
of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his
message <span class="tei tei-q">???to inform most respectfully his reverence Father Pa??ssy,
that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity
that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness
for his presumption.???</span> As the monk had given the message to
Father Pa??ssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading
the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to
Father Pa??ssy in confirmation of the story.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as
he read the news of the <span class="tei tei-q">???miracle,???</span> could not completely restrain
some inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn
smile came into his lips.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We shall see greater things!???</span> broke from him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We shall see greater things, greater things yet!???</span> the monks
around repeated.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Father Pa??ssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least
for a time, not to speak of the matter <span class="tei tei-q">???till it be more fully confirmed,
seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world,
and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,???</span> he added,
prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing
his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Within the hour the <span class="tei tei-q">???miracle???</span> was of course known to the whole
monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one
seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day
before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in
the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame
Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span>
referring to the <span class="tei tei-q">???healing???</span> of the lady's daughter, <span class="tei tei-q">???How can you
presume to do such things????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe.
The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his
cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and
overawed by the visit. This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so
devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already,
as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole institution
of <span class="tei tei-q">???elders,???</span> which he regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation.
He was a very formidable opponent, although from his practice
of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made
him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling,
and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and
ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was
just his craziness attracted them.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived
in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and
this too because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was
seventy-five or more, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary
in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for
another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred
and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still
extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in
this same solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant's
hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary
number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them???which
men brought to the monastery as offerings to God. Father
Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps
burning. It was said (and indeed it was true) that he ate only two
pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper, who lived close by
the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three days, and even
to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely uttered a
word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament
bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the
Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug
was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who
came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span>
prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was brief,
abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare occasions,
however, he would talk to visitors, but for the most part he would
utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no
entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation.
He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief,
chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had
communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with
them, and so was silent with men.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by
the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to
the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. <span class="tei tei-q">???Maybe he will speak
as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him,???</span> the
beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached
in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the
evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a
low bench. A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There
was an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed
down before the saint and asked his blessing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do you want me to bow down to you, monk????</span> said Father
Ferapont. <span class="tei tei-q">???Get up!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The monk got up.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come
from????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his
strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous
old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh
and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had considerable
strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his great age he was
not even quite gray, and still had very thick hair and a full beard,
both of which had once been black. His eyes were gray, large and
luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke with a broad accent.
He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of coarse convict
cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round his waist.
His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of the
coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been
changed for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span>
pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old
slippers almost dropping to pieces.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,???</span> the
monk answered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather
frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester
well????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The monk hesitated.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During
Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed
fruit with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout.
On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha,
all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with
the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole
days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and
water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just
the same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing
is eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till
three o'clock, and then take a little bread and water and drink a
single cup of wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have
something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the
Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: <span class="tei tei-q">???It is unseemly
by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole
of Lent!???</span> This is how we keep the fast. But what is that compared
with you, holy Father,???</span> added the monk, growing more confident,
<span class="tei tei-q">???for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but
bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full
seven. It's truly marvelous???your great abstinence.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And mushrooms????</span> asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mushrooms????</span> repeated the surprised monk.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go
away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries,
but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage
to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of
such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their judgment.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Och, true,???</span> sighed the monk.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And have you seen devils among them????</span> asked Ferapont.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Among them? Among whom????</span> asked the monk, timidly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I
haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding
under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one peeping
out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me;
another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was hanging
round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about without
seeing him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You???can see spirits????</span> the monk inquired.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming
out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the
door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick
long gray tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door
and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He
squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over
him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed spider.
He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they
don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have been there.
I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.???</span>

communication with the Holy Ghost????</span>

Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one
of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished
at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father
Zossima. He was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not
strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should
<span class="tei tei-q">???see marvels.???</span> His words seemed certainly queer, but God only
could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse
words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their
intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the devil's tail
he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative
sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong
prejudice against the institution of <span class="tei tei-q">???elders,???</span> which he only knew
of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before
he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the
secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the
institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who
poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the
fresh <span class="tei tei-q">???miracle???</span> performed by Father Zossima reduced him to
extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their
inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting
to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions
among the monks that were crowding within and without the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span>
elder's cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time,
and only recollected it afterwards.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima,
feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of
Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran
at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Pa??ssy, Father
Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes
and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him suddenly:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Are your people expecting you, my son????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha hesitated.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday
to see them to-day????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I did promise???to my father???my brothers???others too.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die
without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say
that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear
son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the
promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be
the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his
soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in
the town and return quickly. Father Pa??ssy, too, uttered some
words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He
spoke as they left the cell together.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Remember, young man, unceasingly,???</span> Father Pa??ssy began,
without preface, <span class="tei tei-q">???that the science of this world, which has become
a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything
divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel
analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was
sacred of old. But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked
the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole
still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it
not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the
masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls
of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who
have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being
still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span>
nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal
of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When
it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember
this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the
world by your departing elder. Maybe, remembering this great
day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your
guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world
are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my
orphan.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With these words Father Pa??ssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the
monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he
had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in
this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as
though Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and
<span class="tei tei-q">???perhaps that's just what had passed between them,???</span> Alyosha
thought suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard
so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Pa??ssy's heart.
He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation
and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest
defense he could imagine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered
that his father had insisted the day before that he
should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. <span class="tei tei-q">???Why so????</span> Alyosha
wondered suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">???Even if my father has something to say
to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement
yesterday he meant to say something different,???</span> he decided.
Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden
gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),
told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone
out two hours ago.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And my father????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is up, taking his coffee,???</span> Marfa answered somewhat dryly.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table
wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself
by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however.
He was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out
marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a
bold face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which
huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged
with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen terribly in the
night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his
whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man
was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he
came in.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???The coffee is cold,???</span> he cried harshly; <span class="tei tei-q">???I won't offer you any.
I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't
invite any one to share it. Why have you come????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???To find out how you are,???</span> said Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.
You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking
in directly.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he
got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the
fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his
red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,???</span> he observed
sententiously. <span class="tei tei-q">???Well, how are things over there? How is
your elder????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is very bad; he may die to-day,???</span> answered Alyosha. But
his father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question
at once.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan's gone out,???</span> he said suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">???He is doing his utmost
to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,???</span>
he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Surely he did not tell you so????</span> asked Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three
weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you?
He must have had some object in coming.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What do you mean? Why do you say such things????</span> said Alyosha,
troubled.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing
from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well
know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing,
and the longer I live, the more I shall need it,???</span> he continued, pacing
from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his hands in the
pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for
one for another twenty years. As I get older, you know, I shan't be
a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord,
so I shall want my money. So I am saving up more and more,
simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as
well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell
you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others
do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall
upon me for being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the
proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I
believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.
You can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don't want to,
don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here
yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb,
but he has no particular learning ... nor education either. He
sits silent and smiles at one without speaking???that's what pulls him
through.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha listened to him in silence.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself
airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a
minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
you have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what
Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married
and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself.
He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should
leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries
Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what
he's reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better
lie down,???</span> said Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There! you say that,???</span> the old man observed suddenly, as though
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span>
it had struck him for the first time, <span class="tei tei-q">???and I am not angry with you.
But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you
I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are not ill-natured, but distorted,???</span> said Alyosha with a
smile.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked
up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course
in these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a
prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your
old father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own
house, and brag of murdering him outright???all in the presence of
witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked
up at once for what he did yesterday.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Then you don't mean to take proceedings????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's
another thing.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see
him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old
man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to
me.... For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know
her through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy?
Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy
into it, it's delicious, my boy.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,???</span> said
Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket
of his cassock. <span class="tei tei-q">???And you'd better not have brandy, either,???</span> he
suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing
them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then
locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's enough. One glass won't kill me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You see you are in a better humor now,???</span> said Alyosha, smiling.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels
I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya???why is that?
He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span>
are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him
at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As
though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may
as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles
at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on
them. And your Mitya will squelch too. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Your</span></em> Mitya, for you love
him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him.
But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving
him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like
Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust.
When the wind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea
in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out
from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or
maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself
off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without
Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I???I'll ask him,???</span> muttered Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???If you would give him
three thousand, perhaps he??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've
changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give
him anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,???</span> cried the old
man, waving his hand. <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll crush him like a beetle without it.
Don't say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's
nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of
his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from
me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her
yesterday, I believe????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Nothing will induce her to abandon him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young
ladies, very different from???Ah, if I had his youth and the looks
I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and twenty)
I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad!
But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush him!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His anger had returned with the last words.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,???</span> he
snapped harshly.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the
shoulder.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What's that for????</span> The old man was a little surprised. <span class="tei tei-q">???We
shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Not at all, I didn't mean anything.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Nor did I, I did not mean anything,???</span> said the old man, looking
at him. <span class="tei tei-q">???Listen, listen,???</span> he shouted after him, <span class="tei tei-q">???make haste and
come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like
to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the
cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I won't have more!???</span> he muttered, clearing his throat, and again
he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he
went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one
minute he was asleep.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,???</span>
thought Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned
towards Madame Hohlakov's, <span class="tei tei-q">???or I might have to tell him of my
meeting with Grushenka yesterday.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had
renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick
to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday,
he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made
some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever
happens.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on
the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a
great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and
turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is
divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span>
is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between
the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home
from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with
leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in
little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round
the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear.
The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently
holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been
able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although
he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked
schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to-day,
he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into
their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had
stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,
there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a
satchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking
and with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and
anxious watch on the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with
whom he had just come out of school, but with whom he had evidently
had a feud.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy
in a black jacket, observed:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry
it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got
yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you to get
at it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical
remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get
at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a
group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way
so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it
by instinct.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But he is left-handed,???</span> another, a fine healthy-looking boy of
eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He even throws stones with his left hand,???</span> observed a third.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed
the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by
the boy standing the other side of the ditch.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,???</span> they all shouted. But
Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged
himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the
ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose
coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the
group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully
on the shoulder.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,
Karamazov!???</span> the boys shouted, laughing. <span class="tei tei-q">???Come, all throw at him
at once!???</span> and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the
head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously
returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many
of the group had their pockets full too.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one!
Why, you'll kill him,???</span> cried Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary
boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He began first!???</span> cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish
voice. <span class="tei tei-q">???He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day
with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he
must be thrashed.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But what for? I suppose you tease him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,???</span> cried
the children. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all
of you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!???</span> and again a fire of stones,
and a very vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch
was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill
towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: <span class="tei tei-q">???Aha, he is funking,
he is running away. Wisp of tow!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too
good for him,???</span> said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He
seemed to be the eldest.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What's wrong with him????</span> asked Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">???is he a tell-tale or
what????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky????</span> the same boy went
on. <span class="tei tei-q">???Catch him up.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting
and looking at you.???</span>
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is looking at you,???</span> the other boys chimed in.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you
hear, ask him that!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them,
and they at him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,???</span> cried Smurov in a warning
voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease
him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why
you hate him so.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Find out then, find out,???</span> cried the boys, laughing.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence,
straight towards the boy.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You'd better look out,???</span> the boys called after him; <span class="tei tei-q">???he won't
be afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did
Krassotkin.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him,
Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an
undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes
that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby
old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms
stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right
knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a
big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the
pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha
stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The
boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him,
became less defiant, and addressed him first.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!???</span>
he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,???</span> observed
Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I hit Smurov on the head!???</span> cried the boy.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone
at me on purpose,???</span> said Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boy looked darkly at him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I don't know you. Do you know me????</span> Alyosha continued.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Let me alone!???</span> the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span>
though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive
light in his eyes.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Very well, I am going,???</span> said Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">???only I don't know you
and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I
don't want to tease you. Good-by!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Monk in silk trousers!???</span> cried the boy, following Alyosha with
the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself
into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would
fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked
away. He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the
boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then,
when they say that you attack on the sly,???</span> said Alyosha, turning
round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into
Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the
stone struck him on the elbow.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you????</span> he cried.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would
attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like
a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha
had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with
both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and
it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain
and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at
last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's finger had been
badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha
took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured
hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting
all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at
him.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Very well,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???you see how badly you've bitten me.
That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boy stared in amazement.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,???</span>
Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <span class="tei tei-q">???yet I must have done
something to you???you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span>
ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky
Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance
as fast as ever, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up
his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as
he had time, and to solve this mystery. Just now he had not the
time.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome
stone house of two stories, one of the finest in our town.
Though Madame Hohlakov spent most of her time in another province
where she had an estate, or in Moscow, where she had a house
of her own, yet she had a house in our town too, inherited from her
forefathers. The estate in our district was the largest of her three
estates, yet she had been very little in our province before this
time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Did you get my letter about the new miracle????</span> She spoke rapidly
and nervously.

<span class="tei tei-q">???I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or

And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him????my

your brother is in there with her, not that dreadful brother who
was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is

sitting with her talking; they are having a serious conversation. If
you could only imagine what's passing between them now???it's
awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of
horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.
They both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you!
I've been thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst
of it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of
something else, the most important thing???I had quite forgotten
what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics?
As soon as she heard you were here, she began to be hysterical!???</span>

hysterical now, not I,???</span> Lise's voice
caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice
sounded as though she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost
to control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise
was peeping through it, but that he could not see.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make
me hysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has
been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for
the morning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can
make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes
and says that he can make nothing of it. As soon as you approached
the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being
wheeled back into this room here.???</span>

Even that miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how
it has shattered me, that miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And
that tragedy in the drawing-room, it's more than I can bear, I warn
you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy. Tell me,

Alyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked

do it? Water, water! You must wash it first of all, simply hold it

Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin. But do make
haste,???</span> she finished nervously. She was quite frightened at the sight
of Alyosha's wound.

some. You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting

Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother's absence was
precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic
meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise
clasped her hands at his story.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys????</span>

all about it, for there's some mystery in it. Now for the second
thing, but first a question: does the pain prevent you talking about
utterly unimportant things, but talking sensibly????</span>

come to pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the
monastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when
you reach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though
I haven't had time to think about it, I believe I couldn't find a
better wife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must marry.???</span>

That's simply Goulard's water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span>
the name now, but it's a splendid lotion. Would you believe it,
mamma, on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street,
and it was a boy bit his finger, isn't he a child, a child himself? Is
he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be
married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn't it be funny,
wouldn't it be awful????</span>

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over.
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute.
At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan
Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale,
and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve
a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha.
During the preceding month it had been several times suggested
to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina
Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant <span class="tei tei-q">???to carry her off???</span>
from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous,
though it worried him extremely. He loved both his
brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri
had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan
was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In
what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span>
considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha
had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna
had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed
it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was
incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri,
and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such
a passion.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had
struck him. The word <span class="tei tei-q">???lacerating,???</span> which Madame Hohlakov had
just uttered, almost made him start, because half waking up towards
daybreak that night he had cried out <span class="tei tei-q">???Laceration, laceration,???</span>
probably applying it to his dream. He had been dreaming all night
of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's. Now Alyosha
was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and persistent assertion
that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and only deceived
herself through some sort of pose, from <span class="tei tei-q">???self-laceration,???</span> and tortured
herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied
duty of gratitude. <span class="tei tei-q">???Yes,???</span> he thought, <span class="tei tei-q">???perhaps the whole truth
lies in those words.???</span> But in that case what was Ivan's position?
Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's
must dominate, and she could only dominate some one like Dmitri,
and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might at last submit to her
domination <span class="tei tei-q">???to his own happiness???</span> (which was what Alyosha would
have desired), but Ivan???no, Ivan could not submit to her, and
such submission would not give him happiness. Alyosha could not
help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections
flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room. Another
idea, too, forced itself upon him: <span class="tei tei-q">???What if she loved neither
of them???neither Ivan nor Dmitri????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his
own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him
during the last month. <span class="tei tei-q">???What do I know about love and women
and how can I decide such questions????</span> he thought reproachfully,
after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to
think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense
importance in his brothers' lives and that a great deal
depended upon it.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???One reptile will devour the other,???</span> Ivan had pronounced the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span>
day before, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan
looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was
it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had,
of course, escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it
more important. If he felt like that, what chance was there of
peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred
and hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha
to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them?
He loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst
of these conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this
maze, and Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because
his love was always of an active character. He was incapable of
passive love. If he loved any one, he set to work at once to help
him. And to do so he must know what he was aiming at; he must
know for certain what was best for each, and having ascertained
this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of a definite
aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all
sides. <span class="tei tei-q">???It was lacerating,???</span> as was said just now. But what could he
understand even in this <span class="tei tei-q">???laceration???</span>? He did not understand the
first word in this perplexing maze.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to
Ivan, who had already got up to go, <span class="tei tei-q">???A minute! Stay another
minute! I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I
trust absolutely. Don't go away,???</span> she added, addressing Madame
Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down beside her, and Madame
Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear
friends,???</span> she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine
tears of suffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her at once.
<span class="tei tei-q">???You, Alexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable
scene, and saw what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch,
he did. What he thought of me yesterday I don't know. I
only know one thing, that if it were repeated to-day, this minute, I
should express the same feelings again as yesterday???the same feelings,
the same words, the same actions. You remember my actions,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them???</span> ... (as
she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). <span class="tei tei-q">???I must tell you that
I can't get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span>
know whether I still love <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>. I feel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pity</span></em> for him, and that
is a poor sign of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I
shouldn't be sorry for him now, but should hate him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha
shuddered inwardly. <span class="tei tei-q">???That girl is truthful and sincere,???</span> he
thought, <span class="tei tei-q">???and she does not love Dmitri any more.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's true, that's true,???</span> cried Madame Hohlakov.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I
came to during the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a
terrible one???for me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to
change it???nothing. It will be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful
and generous adviser, the one friend I have in the world,
Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deep insight into the heart, approves
and commends my decision. He knows it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, I approve of it,???</span> Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive
my calling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch,
too, to tell me before my two friends whether I am right.
I feel instinctively that you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are
a dear brother to me),???</span> she said again ecstatically, taking his cold
hand in her hot one, <span class="tei tei-q">???I foresee that your decision, your approval, will
bring me peace, in spite of all my sufferings, for, after your words,
I shall be calm and submit???I feel that.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I don't know what you are asking me,???</span> said Alyosha, flushing.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your
happiness more than my own!... But I know nothing about
such affairs,???</span> something impelled him to add hurriedly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief
thing is honor and duty and something higher???I don't know what???but
higher perhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible
feeling in my heart, and it compels me irresistibly. But it
may all be put in two words. I've already decided, even if he marries
that???creature,???</span> she began solemnly, <span class="tei tei-q">???whom I never, never can
forgive, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">even then I will not abandon him</span></em>. Henceforward I will
never, never abandon him!???</span> she cried, breaking into a sort of pale,
hysterical ecstasy. <span class="tei tei-q">???Not that I would run after him continually,
get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away to another
town???where you like???but I will watch over him all my life???I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span>
will watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy
with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let
him come to me and he will find a friend, a sister.... Only a
sister, of course, and so for ever; but he will learn at least that that
sister is really his sister, who loves him and has sacrificed all her life
to him. I will gain my point. I will insist on his knowing me and
confiding entirely in me, without reserve,???</span> she cried, in a sort of
frenzy. <span class="tei tei-q">???I will be a god to whom he can pray???and that, at least,
he owes me for his treachery and for what I suffered yesterday
through him. And let him see that all my life I will be true to him
and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue and betraying
me. I will???I will become nothing but a means for his happiness,
or???how shall I say????an instrument, a machine for his happiness,
and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may
see that all his life! That's my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully
approves me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea
with more dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried
and crude. It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed
that she was still smarting from yesterday's insult, and that her pride
craved satisfaction. She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened,
an unpleasant look came into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw
it and felt a pang of sympathy. His brother Ivan made it worse
by adding:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've only expressed my own view,???</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">???From any one
else, this would have been affected and overstrained, but from you???no.
Any other woman would have been wrong, but you are
right. I don't know how to explain it, but I see that you are absolutely
genuine and, therefore, you are right.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment
stand for? Nothing but yesterday's insult.???</span> Madame Hohlakov obviously
had not intended to interfere, but she could not refrain
from this very just comment.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Quite so, quite so,???</span> cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously
annoyed at being interrupted, <span class="tei tei-q">???in any one else this moment
would be only due to yesterday's impression and would be only a
moment. But with Katerina Ivanovna's character, that moment
will last all her life. What for any one else would be only a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span>
promise is for her an everlasting burdensome, grim perhaps, but
unflagging duty. And she will be sustained by the feeling of this
duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna, will henceforth
be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own
heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will
be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment
of a bold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate
in any case, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of
it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make
you resigned to everything else.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with
intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke
ironically and with intention.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!???</span> Madame Hohlakov cried
again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know
what you will say!???</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.
Alyosha got up from the sofa.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's nothing, nothing!???</span> she went on through her tears. <span class="tei tei-q">???I'm upset,
I didn't sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends
as you and your brother I still feel strong???for I know???you two
will never desert me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow???perhaps to-morrow???and
to leave you for a long time???And, unluckily, it's unavoidable,???</span>
Ivan said suddenly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???To-morrow???to Moscow!???</span> her face was suddenly contorted;
<span class="tei tei-q">???but???but, dear me, how fortunate!???</span> she cried in a voice suddenly
changed. In one instant there was no trace left of her tears. She
underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha.
Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of <span class="tei tei-q">???laceration,???</span>
he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even exceedingly
pleased, as though something agreeable had just happened.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,???</span> she
corrected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile. <span class="tei tei-q">???Such a
friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy
at losing you.???</span> She rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his
hands, pressed them warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">???But what is fortunate is that you
will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
all the horror of my present position. You can speak with complete
openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know
how to do that. You can't think how wretched I was yesterday
and this morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful
letter???for one can never tell such things in a letter.... Now it
will be easy for me to write, for you will see them and explain
everything. Oh, how glad I am! But I am only glad of that,
believe me. Of course, no one can take your place.... I will run
at once to write the letter,???</span> she finished suddenly, and took a step
as though to go out of the room.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so
desperately anxious to hear????</span> cried Madame Hohlakov. There was
a sarcastic, angry note in her voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I had not forgotten that,???</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to
a sudden standstill, <span class="tei tei-q">???and why are you so antagonistic at such a
moment????</span> she added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. <span class="tei tei-q">???What
I said, I repeat. I must have his opinion. More than that, I must
have his decision! As he says, so it shall be. You see how anxious
I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch.... But what's the
matter????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!???</span> Alyosha
cried suddenly in distress.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What? What????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You
said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not
glad of that but sorry to be???losing a friend. But that was acting,
too???you were playing a part???as in a theater!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???In a theater? What? What do you mean????</span> exclaimed Katerina
Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him,
you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is going,???</span>
said Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not
sit down.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What are you talking about? I don't understand.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I don't understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ...
I know I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same,???</span>
Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice. <span class="tei tei-q">???What I
see is that perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all ... and never
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span>
have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri, too, has never loved
you ... and only esteems you.... I really don't know how I
dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody
here will tell the truth.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What truth????</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical
ring in her voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I'll tell you,???</span> Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though
he were jumping from the top of a house. <span class="tei tei-q">???Call Dmitri; I will fetch
him???and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan's
and join your hands. For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you
love him???and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through
<span class="tei tei-q">???self-laceration???</span>???with an unreal love???because you've persuaded
yourself.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha broke off and was silent.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot???that's what
you are!???</span> Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her
lips were moving with anger.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,???</span> he said, with an expression
Alyosha had never seen in his face before???an expression of
youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">???Katerina
Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the time that
I cared for her???though I never said a word of my love to her???she
knew, but she didn't care for me. I have never been her friend
either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my friendship.
She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revenged
with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually
receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that
first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult???that's what her
heart is like! She has talked to me of nothing but her love for
him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you
really love him. And the more he insults you, the more you love
him???that's your <span class="tei tei-q">???laceration.???</span> You love him just as he is; you love
him for insulting you. If he reformed, you'd give him up at once
and cease to love him. But you need him so as to contemplate continually
your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity. And
it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a great deal of humiliation
and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride....
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span>
I am too young and I've loved you too much. I know that I ought
not to say this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply
to leave you, and it would be less offensive for you. But I am going
far away, and shall never come back.... It is for ever. I don't
want to sit beside a <span class="tei tei-q">???laceration.???</span>... But I don't know how to
speak now. I've said everything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna;
you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more
severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never see
you again. Good-by! I don't want your hand. You have tortured
me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment.
I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand. <span class="tei tei-q">???Den
Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,???</span>??????</span> he added, with a forced smile,
showing, however, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he
knew him by heart???which Alyosha would never have believed.
He went out of the room without saying good-by even to his hostess,
Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha clasped his hands.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ivan!???</span> he cried desperately after him. <span class="tei tei-q">???Come back, Ivan! No,
nothing will induce him to come back now!???</span> he cried again, regretfully
realizing it; <span class="tei tei-q">???but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan
spoke angrily, wrongly. Unjustly and angrily. He must come back
here, come back,???</span> Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an
angel,???</span> Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to
Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from
going.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha,
but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble
notes in her hand.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,???</span> she
began, addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice,
as though nothing had happened. <span class="tei tei-q">???A week???yes, I think it was a
week ago???Dmitri Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust
action???a very ugly action. There is a low tavern here, and in it he
met that discharged officer, that captain, whom your father used
to employ in some business. Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his
temper with this captain, seized him by the beard and dragged him
out into the street and for some distance along it, in that insulting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span>
fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite a child, who is at
the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for
his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while every one
laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot
think without indignation of that disgraceful action of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> ...
one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be
capable in his anger ... and in his passions! I can't describe it
even.... I can't find my words. I've made inquiries about his
victim, and find he is quite a poor man. His name is Snegiryov. He
did something wrong in the army and was discharged. I can't tell
you what. And now he has sunk into terrible destitution, with
his family???an unhappy family of sick children, and, I believe, an
insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to
work as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought
if you ... that is I thought ... I don't know. I am so confused.
You see, I wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,
to go to him, to find some excuse to go to them???I mean to that
captain???oh, goodness, how badly I explain it!???and delicately,
carefully, as only you know how to???</span> (Alyosha blushed), <span class="tei tei-q">???manage
to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles. He will be
sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,
rather, what do I mean? You see it's not by way of compensation
to prevent him from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to),
but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me,
Dmitri Fyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself.... But you
know.... I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it ever
so much better. He lives in Lake Street, in the house of a woman
called Kalmikov.... For God's sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it
for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired. Good-by!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She turned and disappeared behind the porti??re so quickly that
Alyosha had not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak.
He longed to beg her pardon, to blame himself, to say something,
for his heart was full and he could not bear to go out of the room
without it. But Madame Hohlakov took him by the hand and drew
him along with her. In the hall she stopped him again as before.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,
generous,???</span> she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. <span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, how I love
her, especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything!
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span>
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you,
that we all, all???both her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even???have
been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that
she may give up your favorite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her
and does not care for her, and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch???such
an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her more than
anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring it about,
and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But she has been crying???she has been wounded again,???</span> cried
Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Never trust a woman's tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never
for the women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mamma, you are spoiling him,???</span> Lise's little voice cried from behind
the door.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,???</span> Alyosha
repeated unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse
for his indiscretion.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel.
I am ready to say so a thousand times over.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel????</span> Lise's voice was
heard again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I somehow fancied all at once,???</span> Alyosha went on as though he
had not heard Lise, <span class="tei tei-q">???that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid
thing.... What will happen now????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???To whom, to whom????</span> cried Lise. <span class="tei tei-q">???Mamma, you really want
to be the death of me. I ask you and you don't answer.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the moment the maid ran in.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ...
hysterics.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What is the matter????</span> cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety.
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At
your age one can't know everything that grown-up people know.
I'll come and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy
on us! I am coming, I am coming.... Hysterics is a good sign,
Alexey Fyodorovitch; it's an excellent thing that she is hysterical.
That's just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against
the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics. Run and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span>
say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her. As for Ivan Fyodorovitch's going
away like that, it's her own fault. But he won't go away. Lise, for
mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It's I
am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted,
delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how
young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he
said all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a
<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">savant</span></span>, and all of a sudden he behaved so
warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine,
like you.... And the way he repeated that German verse, it was
just like you! But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch,
make haste to carry out her commission, and then make haste back.
Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't keep
Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would
have opened the door to see Lise.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???On no account,???</span> cried Lise. <span class="tei tei-q">???On no account now. Speak
through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That's
the only thing I want to know.???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!???</span>

He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been
before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what?
In a love-affair. <span class="tei tei-q">???But what do I know about it? What can I tell
about such things????</span> he repeated to himself for the hundredth time,
flushing crimson. <span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame
is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly
have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me
to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them

together????</span> Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join
their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. <span class="tei tei-q">???Though I acted
quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,???</span> he concluded
suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his
brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street.
Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain,
though he had a presentiment that he would not find his
brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his
way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the
thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute
from the time he set off from the monastery.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was one point which interested him particularly about
Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the captain's
son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying,
the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy
who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had
done to hurt him. Now Alyosha felt practically certain of this,
though he could not have said why. Thinking of another subject
was a relief, and he resolved to think no more about the <span class="tei tei-q">???mischief???</span>
he had done, and not to torture himself with remorse, but to do what
he had to do, let come what would. At that thought he was completely
comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he
felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought
from his father's, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker,
his son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at
Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???He hasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe
he has gone away,???</span> the old man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent
inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answering in accordance
with instructions. When he asked whether he were not at Grushenka's
or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose),
all three looked at him in alarm. <span class="tei tei-q">???They are fond of him,
they are doing their best for him,???</span> thought Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???That's good.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little
house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street,
and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary
cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span>
passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the
house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer
to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood
that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door
across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a simple
cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the
door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew
from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family. <span class="tei tei-q">???Either
they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are
waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock first,???</span> and he
knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of
perhaps ten seconds.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Who's there????</span> shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He
found himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it
was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there
were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove.
From the stove to the window on the left was a string running
across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a
bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with
knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered
pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other
there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was
screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this
curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The
rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle
window. The three windows, which consisted each of four tiny
greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close shut, so
that the room was not very light and rather stuffy. On the table
was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten
piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was
sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and
yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she
was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the
poor woman's eyes???a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty
pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big brown
eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span>
and questioning expression. Beside her at the window stood a young
girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very neatly
dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in. Beside
the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad
sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled
<span class="tei tei-q">???with withered legs,???</span> as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches
stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle
eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man
of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He
was spare, small and weakly built. He had reddish hair and a
scanty light-colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow (this
comparison and the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">???a wisp of tow???</span> flashed at once into
Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).
It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there
was no other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he
leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping
his mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to
come to!???</span> the girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man
spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited
and breaking voice:
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,???</span> he turned
again to Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">???what has brought you to???our retreat????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had
seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable
about him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was not
drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his expression, and
yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He looked like
a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to
it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself.
Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is
horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in the intonation
of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor, at times
spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from one
tone to another. The question about <span class="tei tei-q">???our retreat???</span> he had asked as
it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close
to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed
in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span>
checked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion,
and of very thin material. They were so crumpled and so short
that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a boy.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I am Alexey Karamazov,???</span> Alyosha began in reply.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I quite understand that, sir,???</span> the gentleman snapped out at
once to assure him that he knew who he was already. <span class="tei tei-q">???I am Captain
Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led
you??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with
you???if only you allow me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's what
they used to say in the old comedies, <span class="tei tei-q">???kindly be seated,???</span>??????</span> and with
a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden
chair, not upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of
the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down
facing Alyosha, so close to him that their knees almost touched.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian
infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though
I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my
life I've learnt to say <span class="tei tei-q">???sir.???</span> It's a word you use when you've come
down in the world.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's very true,???</span> smiled Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">???But is it used involuntarily
or on purpose????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I didn't
use the word <span class="tei tei-q">???sir???</span> all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water
I began to say <span class="tei tei-q">???sir.???</span> It's the work of a higher power. I see you are
interested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited
your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise
of hospitality????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've come???about that business.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???About what business????</span> the captain interrupted impatiently.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,???</span>
Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About
my <span class="tei tei-q">???wisp of tow,???</span> then????</span> He moved closer so that his knees positively
knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed
like a thread.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What wisp of tow????</span> muttered Alyosha.
</p><br>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???He is come to complain of me, father!???</span> cried a voice familiar
to Alyosha???the voice of the schoolboy???from behind the curtain.
<span class="tei tei-q">???I bit his finger just now.???</span> The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha
saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and
the chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by
his coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and,
judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at
Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could
not be touched.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???What! Did he bite your finger????</span> The captain jumped up
from his chair. <span class="tei tei-q">???Was it your finger he bit????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There
were six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he
threw a stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him
what I had done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my
finger badly, I don't know why.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I'll thrash him, sir, at once???this minute!???</span> The captain jumped
up from his seat.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ...
I don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha
and thrash him before you for your satisfaction? Would you
like it done at once, sir????</span> said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha,
as though he were going to attack him. <span class="tei tei-q">???I am sorry about your
finger, sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to
chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to
satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers would be
enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for the
fifth one too????</span> He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every
feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely
defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I think I understand it all now,???</span> said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,
still keeping his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">???So your boy is a good boy, he loves
his father, and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant....
Now I understand it,???</span> he repeated thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">???But my brother
Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action, I know that, and if only
it is possible for him to come to you, or better still, to meet you in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span>
that same place, he will ask your forgiveness before every one???if
you wish it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness?
And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn't he????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in
any way you like.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before
me in that very tavern???<span class="tei tei-q">???The Metropolis???</span> it's called???or in the
market-place, he would do it????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, he would even go down on his knees.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears
and pierced me to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother's
generosity. Allow me to introduce my family, my two daughters
and my son???my litter. If I die, who will care for them, and while
I live who but they will care for a wretch like me? That's a great
thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort, sir. For
there must be some one able to love even a man like me.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Ah, that's perfectly true!???</span> exclaimed Alyosha.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and
you put us to shame!???</span> cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning
to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Wait a little, Varvara!???</span> cried her father, speaking peremptorily
but looking at her quite approvingly. <span class="tei tei-q">???That's her character,???</span> he
said, addressing Alyosha again.

now let me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled,
she is forty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of
humble origin. Arina Petrovna, compose your countenance. This
is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.???</span>
He took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him
up. <span class="tei tei-q">???You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It's not the

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he kissed his wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span>
girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an
expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring
face of the woman.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,???</span> she said.

<span class="tei tei-q">???Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of

calls me crippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels,

</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???We are of humble origin,???</span> the captain muttered again.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Oh, father, father!???</span> the hunchback girl, who had till then been
silent on her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Buffoon!???</span> blurted out the girl at the window.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Have you heard our news????</span> said the mother, pointing at her
daughters. <span class="tei tei-q">???It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we
have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have
many such guests. I don't mean to make any comparisons; every
one to their taste. The deacon's wife used to come then and say,
<span class="tei tei-q">???Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya
Petrovna,???</span> she would say, <span class="tei tei-q">???is of the brood of hell.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???Well,???</span> I
said, <span class="tei tei-q">???that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???And you

<span class="tei tei-q">???who asked you to teach me????</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???But my breath,???</span> says she, <span class="tei tei-q">???is clean,
and yours is unclean.???</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???You ask all the officers whether my breath
is unclean.???</span> And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long
ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general
come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him: <span class="tei tei-q">???Your Excellency,???</span>
said I, <span class="tei tei-q">???can a lady's breath be unpleasant????</span> <span class="tei tei-q">???Yes,???</span> he
answered; <span class="tei tei-q">???you ought to open a window-pane or open the door, for
the air is not fresh here.???</span> And they all go on like that! And what
is my breath to them? The dead smell worse still! <span class="tei tei-q">???I won't spoil
the air,???</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll order some slippers and go away.???</span> My darlings,
don't blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can't
please you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school and
loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span>
mother???forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become
unpleasant to you????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed
down her cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely.
Every one loves you, every one adores you.???</span> He began kissing both
her hands again and tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin,
he began wiping away her tears. Alyosha fancied that he
too had tears in his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">???There, you see, you hear????</span> he turned
with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I see and hear,???</span> muttered Alyosha.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never

<span class="tei tei-q">???Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make haste
to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and
I'll put on mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in
earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is my
daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly
angel incarnate ... who has flown down to us mortals,... if
you can understand.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!???</span>
Varvara went on indignantly.

<span class="tei tei-q">???And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool

simply to complain of the boy, and that's hardly likely. And, by
the way, about the boy: I could not explain to you in there, but
here I will describe that scene to you. My tow was thicker a week
ago???I mean my beard. That's the nickname they give to my
beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri
Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I'd done nothing, he
was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged
me out of the tavern into the market-place; at that moment the
boys were coming out of school, and with them Ilusha. As soon
as he saw me in such a state he rushed up to me. <span class="tei tei-q">???Father,???</span> he cried,
<span class="tei tei-q">???father!???</span> He caught hold of me, hugged me, tried to pull me away,
crying to my assailant, <span class="tei tei-q">???Let go, let go, it's my father, forgive him!???</span>???yes,
he actually cried <span class="tei tei-q">???forgive him.???</span> He clutched at that hand,
that very hand, in his little hands and kissed it.... I remember
his little face at that moment, I haven't forgotten it and I never
shall!???</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

deep and sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in
that same market-place.... I'll make him or he is no brother
of mine!???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from
him but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You
should have said so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your
brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give
expression to it at the time. He left off dragging me by my beard
and released me: <span class="tei tei-q">???You are an officer,???</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">???and I am an officer, if
you can find a decent man to be your second send me your challenge.
I will give satisfaction, though you are a scoundrel.???</span> That's
what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I retired with Ilusha, and
that scene is a family record imprinted for ever on Ilusha's soul.
No, it's not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen. Judge for
yourself. You've just been in our mansion, what did you see there?
Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and
hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span>
student, dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation
of the Russian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won't
speak of Ilusha, he is only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I
die, what will become of all of them? I simply ask you that. And
if I challenge him and he kills me on the spot, what then? What
will become of them? And worse still, if he doesn't kill me but
only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I should still be a mouth to
feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I
take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That's
what it means for me to challenge him to a duel. It's silly talk and
nothing else.???</span>

Fyodor Pavlovitch's? <span class="tei tei-q">???And what's more,???</span> she went on, <span class="tei tei-q">???I'll dismiss
you for good and you'll never earn another penny from me. I'll
speak to my merchant too???</span> (that's what she calls her old man)
<span class="tei tei-q">???and he will dismiss you!???</span> And if he dismisses me, what can I earn
then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your
Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another
reason, but he means to make use of papers I've signed to go
to law against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our
retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much?
I didn't like to go into it in our mansion before him.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging
you on me as a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen
how he was throwing stones at his school-fellows! It's very dangerous.
They might kill him. They are children and stupid. A
stone may be thrown and break somebody's head.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???That's just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span>
to-day. Not on the head but on the chest, just above the heart.
He came home crying and groaning and now he is ill.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them
on your account. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with
a pen-knife not long ago.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I've heard about that too, it's dangerous. Krassotkin is an
official here, we may hear more about it.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???I would advise you,???</span> Alyosha went on warmly, <span class="tei tei-q">???not to send
him to school at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger
is passed.???</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???Anger!???</span> the captain repeated, <span class="tei tei-q">???that's just what it is. He is a
little creature, but it's a mighty anger. You don't know all, sir.
Let me tell you more. Since that incident all the boys have been
teasing him about the <span class="tei tei-q">???wisp of tow.???</span> Schoolboys are a merciless
race, individually they are angels, but together, especially in schools,
they are often merciless. Their teasing has stirred up a gallant
spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted,
have felt ashamed of his father, sir, but he stood up for his
father against them all. For his father and for truth and justice.
For what he suffered when he kissed your brother's hand and cried
to him <span class="tei tei-q">???Forgive father, forgive him,???</span>???that only God knows???and
I, his father. For our children???not your children, but ours???the
children of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one???know
what justice means, sir, even at nine years old. How should
the rich know? They don't explore such depths once in their lives.
But at that moment in the square when he kissed his hand, at that
moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means. That truth
entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,???</span> the captain said
hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right fist against
his left palm as though he wanted to show how <span class="tei tei-q">???the truth???</span> crushed
Ilusha. <span class="tei tei-q">???That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was delirious
all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I noticed
he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the
window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see
his mind was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget
my troubles, sinful man as I am, and I don't remember much.
Mamma began crying, too???I am very fond of mamma???well, I
spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don't despise me for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span>
that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best men
amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don't remember
about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering
at him at school. <span class="tei tei-q">???Wisp of tow,???</span> they shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">???your father was
pulled out of the tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged
forgiveness.???</span>??????</span>
</p><br>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">???On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he
looked pale and wretched. <span class="tei tei-q">???What is it????</span> I asked. He wouldn't
answer. Well, there's no talking in our mansion without mamma
and the girls taking part in it. What's more, the girls had heard
about it the very first day. Varvara had begun snarling. <span class="tei tei-q">???You
fools and buffoon
