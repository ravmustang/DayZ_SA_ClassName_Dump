<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">I</span><span class="dropspan">n</span><span>
 which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names' ending in OS and 
IS, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to 
relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>A short time ago, while making researches in the 
Royal Library for my History of Louis XIV, I stumbled by chance upon the
 Memoirs of M. d'Artagnan, printed--as were most of the works of that 
period, in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a 
residence, more or less long, in the Bastille--at Amsterdam, by Pierre 
Rouge. The title attracted me; I took them home with me, with the 
permission of the guardian, and devoured them.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is not my intention here to enter into an 
analysis of this curious work; and I shall satisfy myself with referring
 such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its 
pages. They will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a 
master; and although these squibs may be, for the most part, traced upon
 the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets, they will not find the
 likenesses of Louis XIII, Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the 
courtiers of the period, less faithful than in the history of M. 
Anquetil.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But, it is well known, what strikes the 
capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of 
readers. Now, while admiring, as others doubtless will admire, the 
details we have to relate, our main preoccupation concerned a matter to 
which no one before ourselves had given a thought.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. 
de Treville, captain of the king's Musketeers, he met in the antechamber
 three young men, serving in the illustrious corps into which he was 
soliciting the honor of being received, bearing the names of Athos, 
Porthos, and Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>We must confess these three strange names struck 
us; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, 
under which d'Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else 
that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on 
the day in which, from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had
 donned the simple Musketeer's uniform.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>From the moment we had no rest till we could find
 some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had
 so strongly awakened our curiosity.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The catalogue alone of the books we read with 
this object would fill a whole chapter, which, although it might be very
 instructive, would certainly afford our readers but little amusement. 
It will suffice, then, to tell them that at the moment at which, 
discouraged by so many fruitless investigations, we were about to 
abandon our search, we at length found, guided by the counsels of our 
illustrious friend Paulin Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or
 4773, we do not recollect which, having for title, "Memoirs of the 
Comte de la Fere, Touching Some Events Which Passed in France Toward the
 End of the Reign of King Louis XIII and the Commencement of the Reign 
of King Louis XIV."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It may be easily imagined how great was our joy 
when, in turning over this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the 
twentieth page the name of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of 
Porthos, and at the thirty-first the name of Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript 
at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree
 appeared almost miraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain 
permission to print it, with the view of presenting ourselves someday 
with the pack of others at the doors of the Academie des Inscriptions et
 Belles Lettres, if we should not succeed--a very probable thing, by the
 by--in gaining admission to the Academie Francaise with our own proper 
pack. This permission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; 
which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers 
who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to 
men of letters.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now, this is the first part of this precious 
manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title 
which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of which 
we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the success it merits, 
we will publish the second immediately.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second 
father, we beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the 
Comte de la Fere, the pleasure or the ENNUI he may experience.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This being understood, let us proceed with our history.</span></p><br>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>1 THE THREE PRESENTS OF D'ARTAGNAN THE ELDER</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">O</span><span class="dropspan">n</span><span>
 the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of Meung,
 in which the author of ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born, appeared to be in 
as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a 
second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying toward 
the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors, 
hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain 
courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the 
hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing 
every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In those times panics were common, and few days 
passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event 
of this kind. There were nobles, who made war against each other; there 
was the king, who made war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which 
made war against the king. Then, in addition to these concealed or 
public, secret or open wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, 
wolves, and scoundrels, who made war upon everybody. The citizens always
 took up arms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often 
against nobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never 
against cardinal or Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on 
the said first Monday of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the 
clamor, and seeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of
 the Duc de Richelieu, rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. 
When arrived there, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>A young man--we can sketch his portrait at a 
dash. Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote 
without his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a 
Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet, the blue color of which had 
faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure; 
face long and brown; high cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary
 muscles enormously developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may 
always be detected, even without his cap--and our young man wore a cap 
set off with a sort of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose 
hooked, but finely chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown 
man, an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer's son upon a 
journey had it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a 
leather baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and 
against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>For our young man had a steed which was the 
observed of all observers. It was a Bearn pony, from twelve to fourteen 
years old, yellow in his hide, without a hair in his tail, but not 
without windgalls on his legs, which, though going with his head lower 
than his knees, rendering a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived 
nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the 
qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange-colored
 hide and his unaccountable gait, that at a time when everybody was a 
connoisseur in horseflesh, the appearance of the aforesaid pony at 
Meung--which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before, by 
the gate of Beaugency--produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended 
to his rider.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And this feeling had been more painfully 
perceived by young d'Artagnan--for so was the Don Quixote of this second
 Rosinante named--from his not being able to conceal from himself the 
ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he 
was. He had sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the 
pony from M. d'Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast
 was worth at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied 
the present were above all price.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My son," said the old Gascon gentleman, in that 
pure Bearn PATOIS of which Henry IV could never rid himself, "this horse
 was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has 
remained in it ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell 
it; allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make
 a campaign with it, take as much care of it as you would of an old 
servant. At court, provided you have ever the honor to go there," 
continued M. d'Artagnan the elder, "--an honor to which, remember, your 
ancient nobility gives you the right--sustain worthily your name of 
gentleman, which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five 
hundred years, both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong 
to you. By the latter I mean your relatives and friends. Endure nothing 
from anyone except Monsieur the Cardinal and the king. It is by his 
courage, please observe, by his courage alone, that a gentleman can make
 his way nowadays. Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the 
bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him. 
You are young. You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that 
you are a Gascon, and the second is that you are my son. Never fear 
quarrels, but seek adventures. I have taught you how to handle a sword; 
you have thews of iron, a wrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight 
the more for duels being forbidden, since consequently there is twice as
 much courage in fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but 
fifteen crowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your 
mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had 
from a Bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds
 that do not reach the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily 
and long. I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example 
to you--not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have 
only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de
 Treville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as
 a child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII, whom God preserve! 
Sometimes their play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the 
king was not always the stronger. The blows which he received increased 
greatly his esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Treville. Afterward, 
Monsieur de Treville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris, 
five times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of 
age, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date 
up to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of 
edicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the Musketeers;
 that is to say, chief of a legion of Caesars, whom the king holds in 
great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads--he who dreads nothing, as it 
is said. Still further, Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a
 year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you begin. Go to him 
with this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he
 has done."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Upon which M. d'Artagnan the elder girded his own
 sword round his son, kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him 
his benediction.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man 
found his mother, who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of 
which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent 
employment. The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than 
they had been on the other--not that M. d'Artagnan did not love his son,
 who was his only offspring, but M. d'Artagnan was a man, and he would 
have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; 
whereas Mme. d'Artagnan was a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept 
abundantly; and--let us speak it to the praise of M. d'Artagnan the 
younger--notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm, as a future
 Musketeer ought, nature prevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he 
succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The same day the young man set forward on his 
journey, furnished with the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we
 have said, of fifteen crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de 
Treville--the counsels being thrown into the bargain.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>With such a VADE MECUM d'Artagnan was morally and
 physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so 
happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the 
necessity of sketching his portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for 
giants, and sheep for armies; d'Artagnan took every smile for an insult,
 and every look as a provocation--whence it resulted that from Tarbes to
 Meung his fist was constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his 
sword; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword 
issue from its scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony 
did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as
 against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, 
and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, 
these passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over
 prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of 
the ancients. D'Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his 
susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But there, as he was alighting from his horse at 
the gate of the Jolly Miller, without anyone--host, waiter, or 
hostler--coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse, d'Artagnan spied,
 though an open window on the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and 
of good carriage, although of rather a stern countenance, talking with 
two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect. d'Artagnan 
fancied quite naturally, according to his custom, that he must be the 
object of their conversation, and listened. This time d'Artagnan was 
only in part mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse 
was. The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his 
auditors; and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great 
deference for the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of 
laughter. Now, as a half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility
 of the young man, the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth
 may be easily imagined.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nevertheless, d'Artagnan was desirous of 
examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed 
him. He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger, and perceived a man of 
from forty to forty-five years of age, with black and piercing eyes, 
pale complexion, a strongly marked nose, and a black and well-shaped 
mustache. He was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color, with 
aiguillettes of the same color, without any other ornaments than the 
customary slashes, through which the shirt appeared. This doublet and 
hose, though new, were creased, like traveling clothes for a long time 
packed in a portmanteau. d'Artagnan made all these remarks with the 
rapidity of a most minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive 
feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over 
his future life.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now, as at the moment in which d'Artagnan fixed 
his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made 
one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the Bearnese 
pony, his two auditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, 
though contrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may allowed to
 use such an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there 
could be no doubt; d'Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this 
conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to 
copy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young 
traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and
 the other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger 
increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he 
had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the tip 
of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a 
furious gesture.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself 
behind that shutter--yes, you, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, 
and we will laugh together!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag
 to his cavalier, as if he required some time to ascertain whether it 
could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed; then, when 
he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows 
slightly bent, and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to 
be described, he replied to d'Artagnan, "I was not speaking to you, 
sir."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But I am speaking to you!" replied the young 
man, additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good 
manners, of politeness and scorn.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The stranger looked at him again with a slight 
smile, and retiring from the window, came out of the hostelry with a 
slow step, and placed himself before the horse, within two paces of 
d'Artagnan. His quiet manner and the ironical expression of his 
countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been 
talking, and who still remained at the window.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in 
his youth, a buttercup," resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he
 had begun, and addressing himself to his auditors at the window, 
without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d'Artagnan, 
who, however placed himself between him and them. "It is a color very 
well known in botany, but till the present time very rare among horses."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There are people who laugh at the horse that 
would not dare to laugh at the master," cried the young emulator of the 
furious Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I do not often laugh, sir," replied the 
stranger, "as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance; but 
nevertheless I retain the privilege of laughing when I please."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And I," cried d'Artagnan, "will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed, sir," continued the stranger, more calm 
than ever; "well, that is perfectly right!" and turning on his heel, was
 about to re-enter the hostelry by the front gate, beneath which 
d'Artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But, d'Artagnan was not of a character to allow a
 man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew 
his sword entirely from the scabbard, and followed him, crying, "Turn, 
turn, Master Joker, lest I strike you behind!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Strike me!" said the other, turning on his 
heels, and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as 
contempt. "Why, my good fellow, you must be mad!" Then, in a suppressed 
tone, as if speaking to himself, "This is annoying," continued he. "What
 a godsend this would be for his Majesty, who is seeking everywhere for 
brave fellows to recruit for his Musketeers!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He had scarcely finished, when d'Artagnan made 
such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, 
it is probable he would have jested for the last time. The stranger, 
then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, 
saluted his adversary, and seriously placed himself on guard. But at the
 same moment, his two auditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon 
d'Artagnan with sticks, shovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and 
complete a diversion from the attack that d'Artagnan's adversary, while 
the latter turned round to face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword
 with the same precision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly 
been, became a spectator of the fight--a part in which he acquitted 
himself with his usual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, "A plague
 upon these Gascons! Replace him on his orange horse, and let him 
begone!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not before I have killed you, poltroon!" cried 
d'Artagnan, making the best face possible, and never retreating one step
 before his three assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Another gasconade!" murmured the gentleman. "By 
my honor, these Gascons are incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since
 he will have it so. When he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he 
has had enough of it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the stranger knew not the headstrong 
personage he had to do with; d'Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for 
quarter. The fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at 
length d'Artagnan dropped his sword, which was broken in two pieces by 
the blow of a stick. Another blow full upon his forehead at the same 
moment brought him to the ground, covered with blood and almost 
fainting.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was at this moment that people came flocking 
to the scene of action from all sides. The host, fearful of 
consequences, with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into
 the kitchen, where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>As to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the 
window, and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience, evidently 
annoyed by their remaining undispersed.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, how is it with this madman?" exclaimed he,
 turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the 
host, who came in to inquire if he was unhurt.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Your excellency is safe and sound?" asked the host.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know what has become of our young man."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He is better," said the host, "he fainted quite away."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed!" said the gentleman.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you, and to defy you while challenging you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, this fellow must be the devil in person!" cried the stranger.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil," 
replied the host, with a grin of contempt; "for during his fainting we 
rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven 
crowns--which however, did not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, 
that if such a thing had happened in Paris, you should have cause to 
repent of it at a later period."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then," said the stranger coolly, "he must be some prince in disguise."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have told you this, good sir," resumed the host, "in order that you may be on your guard."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Did he name no one in his passion?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes; he struck his pocket and said, 'We shall see what Monsieur de Treville will think of this insult offered to his protege.'"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur de Treville?" said the stranger, 
becoming attentive, "he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing 
the name of Monsieur de Treville? Now, my dear host, while your young 
man was insensible, you did not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what
 that pocket contained. What was there in it?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A letter addressed to Monsieur de Treville, captain of the Musketeers."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The host, who was not endowed with great 
perspicacity, did not observe the expression which his words had given 
to the physiognomy of the stranger. The latter rose from the front of 
the window, upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow, and 
knitted his brow like a man disquieted.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The devil!" murmured he, between his teeth. "Can
 Treville have set this Gascon upon me? He is very young; but a sword 
thrust is a sword thrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a
 youth is less to be suspected than an older man," and the stranger fell
 into a reverie which lasted some minutes. "A weak obstacle is sometimes
 sufficient to overthrow a great design.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Host," said he, "could you not contrive to get 
rid of this frantic boy for me? In conscience, I cannot kill him; and 
yet," added he, with a coldly menacing expression, "he annoys me. Where 
is he?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In my wife's chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his wounds."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"His things and his bag are with him? Has he taken off his doublet?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"On the contrary, everything is in the kitchen. But if he annoys you, this young fool--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To be sure he does. He causes a disturbance in 
your hostelry, which respectable people cannot put up with. Go; make out
 my bill and notify my servant."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse. Have they not obeyed me?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the great gateway, ready saddled for your departure."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is well; do as I have directed you, then."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What the devil!" said the host to himself. "Can 
he be afraid of this boy?" But an imperious glance from the stranger 
stopped him short; he bowed humbly and retired.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by 
this fellow," continued the stranger. "She will soon pass; she is 
already late. I had better get on horseback, and go and meet her. I 
should like, however, to know what this letter addressed to Treville 
contains."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>We are well aware that this term, milady, is only
 properly used when followed by a family name. But we find it thus in 
the manuscript, and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And the stranger, muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the meantime, the host, who entertained no 
doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger 
from his hostelry, re-ascended to his wife's chamber, and found 
d'Artagnan just recovering his senses. Giving him to understand that the
 police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel 
with a great lord--for the opinion of the host the stranger could be 
nothing less than a great lord--he insisted that notwithstanding his 
weakness d'Artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible. 
D'Artagnan, half stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound
 up in a linen cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to 
descend the stairs; but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he 
saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, 
drawn by two large Norman horses.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>His interlocutor, whose head appeared through the
 carriage window, was a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We
 have already observed with what rapidity d'Artagnan seized the 
expression of a countenance. He perceived then, at a glance, that this 
woman was young and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more 
forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern 
countries in which d'Artagnan had hitherto resided. She was pale and 
fair, with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had 
large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster. She 
was talking with great animation with the stranger.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"His Eminence, then, orders me--" said the lady.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves London."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And as to my other instructions?" asked the fair traveler.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"They are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are on the other side of the Channel."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very well; and you--what will you do?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I--I return to Paris."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What, without chastising this insolent boy?" asked the lady.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The stranger was about to reply; but at the 
moment he opened his mouth, d'Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated 
himself over the threshold of the door.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This insolent boy chastises others," cried he; 
"and I hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape 
him as before."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Will not escape him?" replied the stranger, knitting his brow.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Remember," said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword, "the least delay may ruin everything."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are right," cried the gentleman; "begone 
then, on your part, and I will depart as quickly on mine." And bowing to
 the lady, sprang into his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip 
vigorously to his horses. The two interlocutors thus separated, taking 
opposite directions, at full gallop.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Pay him, booby!" cried the stranger to his 
servant, without checking the speed of his horse; and the man, after 
throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped 
after his master.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Base coward! false gentleman!" cried d'Artagnan,
 springing forward, in his turn, after the servant. But his wound had 
rendered him too weak to support such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone 
ten steps when his ears began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud
 of blood passed over his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street,
 crying still, "Coward! coward! coward!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He is a coward, indeed," grumbled the host, 
drawing near to d'Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to 
make up matters with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with 
the snail he had despised the evening before.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, a base coward," murmured d'Artagnan; "but she--she was very beautiful."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What she?" demanded the host.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Milady," faltered d'Artagnan, and fainted a second time.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, it's all one," said the host; "I have lost 
two customers, but this one remains, of whom I am pretty certain for 
some days to come. There will be eleven crowns gained."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d'Artagnan's purse.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The host had reckoned upon eleven days of 
confinement at a crown a day, but he had reckoned without his guest. On 
the following morning at five o'clock d'Artagnan arose, and descending 
to the kitchen without help, asked, among other ingredients the list of 
which has not come down to us, for some oil, some wine, and some 
rosemary, and with his mother's recipe in his hand composed a balsam, 
with which he anointed his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages 
himself, and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor, 
d'Artagnan walked about that same evening, and was almost cured by the 
morrow.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But when the time came to pay for his rosemary, 
this oil, and the wine, the only expense the master had incurred, as he 
had preserved a strict abstinence--while on the contrary, the yellow 
horse, by the account of the hostler at least, had eaten three times as 
much as a horse of his size could reasonably supposed to have 
done--d'Artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet 
purse with the eleven crowns it contained; for as to the letter 
addressed to M. de Treville, it had disappeared.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young man commenced his search for the letter
 with the greatest patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over 
and over again, rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and
 reopening his purse; but when he found that he had come to the 
conviction that the letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third 
time, into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of 
wine, oil, and rosemary--for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become 
exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if 
his letter were not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom 
handle, and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My letter of recommendation!" cried d'Artagnan, 
"my letter of recommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all 
like ortolans!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Unfortunately, there was one circumstance which 
created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which 
was, as we have related, that his sword had been in his first conflict 
broken in two, and which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted 
when d'Artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself
 purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten 
inches in length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. 
As to the rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side 
to make himself a larding pin.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But this deception would probably not have 
stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the 
reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But, after all," said he, lowering the point of his spit, "where is this letter?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, where is this letter?" cried d'Artagnan. 
"In the first place, I warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de 
Treville, and it must be found, he will know how to find it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>His threat completed the intimidation of the 
host. After the king and the cardinal, M. de Treville was the man whose 
name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military, and even by 
citizens. There was, to be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never 
pronounced but with a subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his
 Gray Eminence, as the cardinal's familiar was called.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Throwing down his spit, and ordering his wife to 
do the same with her broom handle, and the servants with their sticks, 
he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost 
letter.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Does the letter contain anything valuable?" demanded the host, after a few minutes of useless investigation.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Zounds! I think it does indeed!" cried the 
Gascon, who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court. "It 
contained my fortune!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Bills upon Spain?" asked the disturbed host.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Bills upon his Majesty's private treasury," 
answered d'Artagnan, who, reckoning upon entering into the king's 
service in consequence of this recommendation, believed he could make 
this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The devil!" cried the host, at his wit's end.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But it's of no importance," continued 
d'Artagnan, with natural assurance; "it's of no importance. The money is
 nothing; that letter was everything. I would rather have lost a 
thousand pistoles than have lost it." He would not have risked more if 
he had said twenty thousand; but a certain juvenile modesty restrained 
him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That letter is not lost!" cried he.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What!" cried d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, it has been stolen from you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Stolen? By whom?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"By the gentleman who was here yesterday. He came
 down into the kitchen, where your doublet was. He remained there some 
time alone. I would lay a wager he has stolen it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you think so?" answered d'Artagnan, but 
little convinced, as he knew better than anyone else how entirely 
personal the value of this letter was, and was nothing in it likely to 
tempt cupidity. The fact was that none of his servants, none of the 
travelers present, could have gained anything by being possessed of this
 paper.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you say," resumed d'Artagnan, "that you suspect that impertinent gentleman?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I tell you I am sure of it," continued the host.
 "When I informed him that your lordship was the protege of Monsieur de 
Treville, and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman,
 he appeared to be very much disturbed, and asked me where that letter 
was, and immediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your 
doublet was."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then that's my thief," replied d'Artagnan. "I 
will complain to Monsieur de Treville, and Monsieur de Treville will 
complain to the king." He then drew two crowns majestically from his 
purse and gave them to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to 
the gate, and remounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any 
further accident to the gate of St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner 
sold him for three crowns, which was a very good price, considering that
 d'Artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage. Thus the dealer 
to whom d'Artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the
 young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of
 the originality of his color.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Thus d'Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying 
his little packet under his arm, and walked about till he found an 
apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means. This
 chamber was a sort of garret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near 
the Luxembourg.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>As soon as the earnest money was paid, d'Artagnan
 took possession of his lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in 
sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his 
mother had taken off an almost-new doublet of the elder M. d'Artagnan, 
and which she had given her son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de 
Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword, and then returned toward 
the Louvre, inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of
 the hotel of M. de Treville, which proved to be in the Rue du 
Vieux-Colombier; that is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the 
chamber hired by d'Artagnan--a circumstance which appeared to furnish a 
happy augury for the success of his journey.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>After this, satisfied with the way in which he 
had conducted himself at Meung, without remorse for the past, confident 
in the present, and full of hope for the future, he retired to bed and 
slept the sleep of the brave.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to 
nine o'clock in the morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair 
to the residence of M. de Treville, the third personage in the kingdom, 
in the paternal estimation.</span></p><br>

<div class="level-2 section" id="the-antechamber-of-m-de-treville">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>2 THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TREVILLE</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">M</span><span class="dropspan"> de Troisville, as</span><span>
 his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de Treville, as he has 
ended by styling himself in Paris, had really commenced life as 
d'Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in his pocket, but 
with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence which makes the 
poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal
 inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan gentleman derives
 in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still more insolent 
success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had borne him to the
 top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which he had climbed 
four steps at a time.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was the friend of the king, who honored 
highly, as everyone knows, the memory of his father, Henry IV. The 
father of M. de Treville had served him so faithfully in his wars 
against the league that in default of money--a thing to which the 
Bearnais was accustomed all his life, and who constantly paid his debts 
with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing, that is to say, 
with ready wit--in default of money, we repeat, he authorized him, after
 the reduction of Paris, to assume for his arms a golden lion passant 
upon gules, with the motto FIDELIS ET FORTIS. This was a great matter in
 the way of honor, but very little in the way of wealth; so that when 
the illustrious companion of the great Henry died, the only inheritance 
he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto. Thanks to this
 double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it, M. de Treville 
was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such 
good use of his sword, and was so faithful to his motto, that Louis 
XIII, one of the good blades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that 
if he had a friend who was about to fight, he would advise him to choose
 as a second, himself first, and Treville next--or even, perhaps, before
 himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Thus Louis XIII had a real liking for Treville--a
 royal liking, a self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking.
 At that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be 
surrounded by such men as Treville. Many might take for their device the
 epithet STRONG, which formed the second part of his motto, but very few
 gentlemen could lay claim to the FAITHFUL, which constituted the first.
 Treville was one of these latter. His was one of those rare 
organizations, endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the 
dog; with a blind valor, a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight 
appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with 
anyone, and the hand to strike this displeasing personage, whether a 
Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltiot de Mere, or a Vitry. In short, up to this 
period nothing had been wanting to Treville but opportunity; but he was 
ever on the watch for it, and he faithfully promised himself that he 
would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within 
reach of his hand. At last Louis XIII made Treville the captain of his 
Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII in devotedness, or rather in 
fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to Henry III, and his Scotch 
Guard to Louis XI.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king
 in this respect. When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which 
Louis XIII had surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first 
king of France, became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He 
had his Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two 
powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the
 provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most 
celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII 
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their 
servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people. 
While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them 
secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine 
regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn this
 from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these 
defeats and in many of these victories.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Treville had grasped the weak side of his master;
 and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a
 king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful 
in his friendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand
 Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his 
Eminence curl with ire. Treville understood admirably the war method of 
that period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy 
must live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a 
legion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all but
 himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Loose, half-drunk, imposing, the king's 
Musketeers, or rather M. de Treville's, spread themselves about in the 
cabarets, in the public walks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting
 their mustaches, clanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in 
annoying the Guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with 
them; then drawing in the open streets, as if it were the best of all 
possible sports; sometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept
 and avenged; often killing others, but then certain of not rotting in 
prison, M. de Treville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Treville 
was praised to the highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, 
ruffians as they were, trembled before him like scholars before their 
master, obedient to his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to
 wash out the smallest insult.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville employed this powerful weapon for 
the king, in the first place, and the friends of the king--and then for 
himself and his own friends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this 
period, which has left so many memoirs, one does not find this worthy 
gentleman blamed even by his enemies; and he had many such among men of 
the pen as well as among men of the sword. In no instance, let us say, 
was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from 
the cooperation of his minions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue 
which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an 
honest man. Still further, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and 
painful exercises which fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant 
frequenters of revels, one of the most insinuating lady's men, one of 
the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the BONNES 
FORTUNES of de Treville
were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been talked of twenty 
years before, and that was not saying a little. The captain of the 
Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and this 
constitutes the zenith of human fortune.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Louis XIV absorbed all the smaller stars of his 
court in his own vast radiance; but his father, a sun PLURIBUS IMPAR, 
left his personal splendor to each of his favorites, his individual 
value to each of his courtiers. In addition to the leeves of the king 
and the cardinal, there might be reckoned in Paris at that time more 
than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy leeves. Among these two 
hundred leeves, that of Treville was one of the most sought.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The court of his hotel, situated in the Rue du 
Vieux-Colombier, resembled a camp from by six o'clock in the morning in 
summer and eight o'clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who 
appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing 
number, paraded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. 
On one of those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization
 would build a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of
 Paris, who ran after any sort of favor--gentlemen from the provinces 
anxious to be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing 
and carrying messages between their masters and M. de Treville. In the 
antechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to 
say, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing 
prevailed from morning till night, while M. de Treville, in his office 
contiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to complaints,
 gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the Louvre, had 
only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The day on which d'Artagnan presented himself the
 assemblage was imposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving 
from his province. It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and 
that, particularly at this period, the compatriots of d'Artagnan had the
 reputation of not being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the
 massive door covered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the 
midst of a troop of swordsmen, who crossed one another in their passage,
 calling out, quarreling, and playing tricks one with another. In order 
to make one's way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves, it was 
necessary to be an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was, then, into the midst of this tumult and 
disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heat, ranging his 
long rapier up his lanky leg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his 
cap, with that half-smile of the embarrassed a provincial who wishes to 
put on a good face. When he had passed one group he began to breathe 
more freely; but he could not help observing that they turned round to 
look at him, and for the first time in his life d'Artagnan, who had till
 that day entertained a very good opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Arrived at the staircase, it was still worse. 
There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with 
the following exercise, while ten or twelve of their comrades waited 
upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked 
sword in hand, prevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three 
others from ascending.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>These three others fenced against him with their agile swords.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils,
 and believed them to be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain 
scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each 
of these scratches not only the spectators, but even the actors 
themselves, laughed like so many madmen.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept
 his adversaries marvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. 
The conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit 
the game, yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit
 him. In five minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, 
another on the ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained 
intact--a piece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules 
agreed upon, three turns of favor.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>However difficult it might be, or rather as he 
pretended it was, to astonish our young traveler, this pastime really 
astonished him. He had seen in his province--that land in which heads 
become so easily heated--a few of the preliminaries of duels; but the 
daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever 
heard of even in Gascony. He believed himself transported into that 
famous country of giants into which Gulliver afterward went and was so 
frightened; and yet he had not gained the goal, for there were still the
 landing place and the antechamber.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>On the landing they were no longer fighting, but 
amused themselves with stories about women, and in the antechamber, with
 stories about the court. On the landing d'Artagnan blushed; in the 
antechamber he trembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in 
Gascony had rendered formidable to young chambermaids, and even 
sometimes their mistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of 
delirium, of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of 
gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best 
known and with details the least concealed. But if his morals were 
shocked on the landing, his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in 
the antechamber. There, to his great astonishment, d'Artagnan heard the 
policy which made all Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly, as 
well as the private life of the cardinal, which so many great nobles had
 been punished for trying to pry into. That great man who was so revered
 by d'Artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the 
Musketeers of Treville, who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and 
his crooked back. Some sang ballads about Mme. d'Aguillon, his mistress,
 and Mme. Cambalet, his niece; while others formed parties and plans to 
annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke--all things which 
appeared to d'Artagnan monstrous impossibilities.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nevertheless, when the name of the king was now 
and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of 
gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They 
looked hesitatingly around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of 
the partition between them and the office of M. de Treville; but a fresh
 allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then 
the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from 
any of his actions.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Certes, these fellows will all either be 
imprisoned or hanged," thought the terrified d'Artagnan, "and I, no 
doubt, with them; for from the moment I have either listened to or heard
 them, I shall be held as an accomplice. What would my good father say, 
who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he
 knew I was in the society of such pagans?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>We have no need, therefore, to say that 
d'Artagnan dared not join in the conversation, only he looked with all 
his eyes and listened with all his ears, stretching his five senses so 
as to lose nothing; and despite his confidence on the paternal 
admonitions, he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his 
instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard-of things which 
were taking place.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Although he was a perfect stranger in the court 
of M. de Treville's courtiers, and this his first appearance in that 
place, he was at length noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he
 wanted. At this demand d'Artagnan gave his name very modestly, 
emphasized the title of compatriot, and begged the servant who had put 
the question to him to request a moment's audience of M. de Treville--a 
request which the other, with an air of protection, promised to transmit
 in due season.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The center of the most animated group was a 
Musketeer of great height and haughty countenance, dressed in a costume 
so peculiar as to attract general attention. He did not wear the uniform
 cloak--which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more 
independence--but a cerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and 
over this a magnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water 
ripples in the sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful 
folds from his shoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from
 which was suspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off
 guard, complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time 
affectedly. It was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that
 he had put on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and 
twisted his mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, 
and d'Artagnan more than anyone.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What would you have?" said the Musketeer. "This 
fashion is coming in. It is a folly, I admit, but still it is the 
fashion. Besides, one must lay out one's inheritance somehow."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, Porthos!" cried one of his companions, 
"don't try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal 
generosity. It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the 
other Sunday, near the gate St. Honor."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I
 bought it with the contents of my own purse," answered he whom they 
designated by the name Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes; about in the same manner," said another 
Musketeer, "that I bought this new purse with what my mistress put into 
the old one."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's true, though," said Porthos; "and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Is it not true, Aramis?" said Porthos, turning toward another Musketeer.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to
 his interrogator, who had just designated him by the name of Aramis. He
 was a stout man, of about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, 
ingenuous countenance, a black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as 
an autumn peach. His delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line 
upon his upper lip; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their 
veins should swell, and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to 
time to preserve their delicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke 
little and slowly, bowed frequently, laughed without noise, showing his 
teeth, which were fine and of which, as the rest of his person, he 
appeared to take great care. He answered the appeal of his friend by an 
affirmative nod of the head.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts 
with regard to the baldric. They continued to admire it, but said no 
more about it; and with a rapid change of thought, the conversation 
passed suddenly to another subject.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What do you think of the story Chalais's esquire
 relates?" asked another Musketeer, without addressing anyone in 
particular, but on the contrary speaking to everybody.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And what does he say?" asked Porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort, 
the AME DAMNEE of the cardinal disguised as a Capuchin, and that this 
cursed Rochefort, thanks to his disguise, had tricked Monsieur de 
Laigues, like a ninny as he is."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A ninny, indeed!" said Porthos; "but is the matter certain?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I had it from Aramis," replied the Musketeer.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, you knew it, Porthos," said Aramis. "I told you of it yesterday. Let us say no more about it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Say no more about it? That's YOUR opinion!" replied Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Say no more about it! PESTE! You come to your 
conclusions quickly. What! The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has
 his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a 
rascal-has, with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence,
 Chalais's throat cut, under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill 
the king and marry Monsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this 
enigma. You unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and
 while we are still gaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us
 today, 'Let us say no more about it.'"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it," replied Aramis, patiently.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This Rochefort," cried Porthos, "if I were the 
esquire of poor Chalais, should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably 
with me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you--you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke," replied Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, the Red Duke! Bravo! Bravo! The Red Duke!" 
cried Porthos, clapping his hands and nodding his head. "The Red Duke is
 capital. I'll circulate that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. Who 
says this Aramis is not a wit? What a misfortune it is you did not 
follow your first vocation; what a delicious abbe you would have made!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, it's only a temporary postponement," replied
 Aramis; "I shall be one someday. You very well know, Porthos, that I 
continue to study theology for that purpose."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He will be one, as he says," cried Porthos; "he will be one, sooner or later."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Sooner." said Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock, which hangs behind his uniform," said another Musketeer.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What is he waiting for?" asked another.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No jesting upon that subject, gentlemen," said Porthos; "thank God the queen is still of an age to give one!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"They say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in 
France," replied Aramis, with a significant smile which gave to this 
sentence, apparently so simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Aramis, my good friend, this time you are 
wrong," interrupted Porthos. "Your wit is always leading you beyond 
bounds; if Monsieur de Treville heard you, you would repent of speaking 
thus."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Are you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?" cried Aramis, from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbe. Be 
one or the other, but not both," replied Porthos. "You know what Athos 
told you the other day; you eat at everybody's mess. Ah, don't be angry,
 I beg of you, that would be useless; you know what is agreed upon 
between you, Athos and me. You go to Madame d'Aguillon's, and you pay 
your court to her; you go to Madame de Bois-Tracy's, the cousin of 
Madame de Chevreuse, and you pass for being far advanced in the good 
graces of that lady. Oh, good Lord! Don't trouble yourself to reveal 
your good luck; no one asks for your secret-all the world knows your 
discretion. But since you possess that virtue, why the devil don't you 
make use of it with respect to her Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of 
the king and the cardinal, and how he likes; but the queen is sacred, 
and if anyone speaks of her, let it be respectfully."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Porthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly
 tell you so," replied Aramis. "You know I hate moralizing, except when 
it is done by Athos. As to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a 
baldric to be strong on that head. I will be an abbe if it suits me. In 
the meanwhile I am a Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and
 at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Aramis!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Porthos!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" cried the surrounding group.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur de Treville awaits Monsieur d'Artagnan," cried a servant, throwing open the door of the cabinet.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this announcement, during which the door 
remained open, everyone became mute, and amid the general silence the 
young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber, and entered the
 apartment of the captain of the Musketeers, congratulating himself with
 all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange 
quarrel.</span></p><br>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>3 THE AUDIENCE</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">M</span><span class="dropspan"> de Treville</span><span>
 was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he saluted the 
young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he smiled on 
receiving d'Artagnan's response, the Bearnese accent of which recalled 
to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double remembrance 
which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the antechamber
 and making a sign to d'Artagnan with his hand, as if to ask his 
permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called 
three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through 
the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry 
accent.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Athos! Porthos! Aramis!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two Musketeers with whom we have already made
 acquaintance, and who answered to the last of these three names, 
immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part, and 
advanced toward the cabinet, the door of which closed after them as soon
 as they had entered. Their appearance, although it was not quite at 
ease, excited by its carelessness, at once full of dignity and 
submission, the admiration of d'Artagnan, who beheld in these two men 
demigods, and in their leader an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his 
thunders.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the two Musketeers had entered; when the 
door was closed behind them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber,
 to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh 
food, had recommenced; when M. de Treville had three or four times paced
 in silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, 
passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and 
silent as if on parade--he stopped all at once full in front of them, 
and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, "Do you know 
what the king said to me," cried he, "and that no longer ago than 
yesterday evening--do you know, gentlemen?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," replied the two Musketeers, after a moment's silence, "no, sir, we do not."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us," added Aramis, in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The Guards of the cardinal! And why so?" asked Porthos, warmly.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of 
their eyes. d'Artagnan did not know where he was, and wished himself a 
hundred feet underground.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes," continued M. de Treville, growing 
warmer as he spoke, "and his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it 
is true that the Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The 
cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of 
condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those 
DAMNED MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an 
ironical tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, 
glancing at me with his tiger-cat's eye, had made a riot in the Rue 
Ferou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was 
going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! 
MORBLEU! You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were 
among them--you were! Don't deny it; you were recognized, and the 
cardinal named you. But it's all my fault; yes, it's all my fault, 
because it is myself who selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did 
you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a 
cassock? And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric 
to suspend a sword of straw from it? And Athos--I don't see Athos. Where
 is he?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ill--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very ill, say you? And of what malady?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir," 
replied Porthos, desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; "and 
what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The smallpox! That's a great story to tell me, 
Porthos! Sick of the smallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without 
doubt, killed, perhaps. Ah, if I knew! S'blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I 
will not have this haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the 
streets, this swordplay at the crossways; and above all, I will not have
 occasion given for the cardinal's Guards, who are brave, quiet, 
skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested, and 
who, besides, never allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I 
am sure of it--they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or 
taking back a step. To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee--that 
is good for the king's Musketeers!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could
 willingly have strangled M. de Treville, if, at the bottom of all this,
 they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him 
speak thus. They stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their
 lips till the blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with 
all their might. All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos,
 and Aramis called, and had guessed, from M. de Treville's tone of 
voice, that he was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were 
glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely
 applied to the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while 
their mouths repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the 
captain to all the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the 
door of the cabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! The king's Musketeers are arrested by the 
Guards of the cardinal, are they?" continued M. de Treville, as furious 
at heart as his soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, 
one by one, so to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms
 of his auditors. "What! Six of his Eminence's Guards arrest six of his 
Majesty's Musketeers! MORBLEU! My part is taken! I will go straight to 
the louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king's 
Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal's Guards, and if he 
refuses me, MORBLEU! I will turn abbe."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At these words, the murmur without became an 
explosion; nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The 
MORBLEUS, the SANG DIEUS, the MORTS TOUTS LES DIABLES, crossed one 
another in the air. D'Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he 
might hide himself, and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the 
table.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, my Captain," said Porthos, quite beside 
himself, "the truth is that we were six against six. But we were not 
captured by fair means; and before we had time to draw our swords, two 
of our party were dead, and Athos, grievously wounded, was very little 
better. For you know Athos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get 
up, and fell again twice. And we did not surrender--no! They dragged us 
away by force. On the way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to
 be dead, and left him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking 
it worth the trouble to carry him away. That's the whole story. What the
 devil, Captain, one cannot win all one's battles! The great Pompey lost
 that of Pharsalia; and Francis the First, who was, as I have heard say,
 as good as other folks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And I have the honor of assuring you that I 
killed one of them with his own sword," said Aramis; "for mine was 
broken at the first parry. Killed him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most
 agreeable to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I did not know that," replied M. de Treville, in a somewhat softened tone. "The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But pray, sir," continued Aramis, who, seeing 
his captain become appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, "do not say that
 Athos is wounded. He would be in despair if that should come to the 
ears of the king; and as the wound is very serious, seeing that after 
crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest, it is to be 
feared--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head, but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Athos!" cried the two Musketeers.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Athos!" repeated M. de Treville himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have sent for me, sir," said Athos to M. de 
Treville, in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice, "you have sent for me, 
as my comrades inform me, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I 
am here; what do you want with me?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And at these words, the Musketeer, in 
irreproachable costume, belted as usual, with a tolerably firm step, 
entered the cabinet. M. de Treville, moved to the bottom of his heart by
 this proof of courage, sprang toward him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I was about to say to these gentlemen," added 
he, "that I forbid my Musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for 
brave men are very dear to the king, and the king knows that his 
Musketeers are the bravest on the earth. Your hand, Athos!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And without waiting for the answer of the 
newcomer to this proof of affection, M. de Treville seized his right 
hand and pressed it with all his might, without perceiving that Athos, 
whatever might be his self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to 
escape him, and if possible, grew paler than he was before.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The door had remained open, so strong was the 
excitement produced by the arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as
 a secret, was known to all. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last 
words of the captain; and two or three heads, carried away by the 
enthusiasm of the moment, appeared through the openings of the tapestry.
 M. de Treville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of 
etiquette, when he felt the hand of Athos, who had rallied all his 
energies to contend against pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon 
the floor as if he were dead.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A surgeon!" cried M. de Treville, "mine! The king's! The best! A surgeon! Or, s'blood, my brave Athos will die!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the cries of M. de Treville, the whole 
assemblage rushed into the cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door 
against anyone, and all crowded round the wounded man. But all this 
eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called 
for had not chanced to be in the hotel. He pushed through the crowd, 
approached Athos, still insensible, and as all this noise and commotion 
inconvenienced him greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent 
thing, that the Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. 
Immediately M. de Treville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and 
Aramis, who bore their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked 
the surgeon; and behind the surgeon the door closed.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The cabinet of M. de Treville, generally held so 
sacred, became in an instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone 
spoke, harangued, and vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the
 cardinal and his Guards to all the devils.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de Treville alone remaining with the wounded.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At length, M. de Treville himself returned. The 
injured man had recovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the 
situation of the Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends 
uneasy, his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of 
blood.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then M. de Treville made a sign with his hand, 
and all retired except d'Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an 
audience, and with the tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>When all had gone out and the door was closed, M.
 de Treville, on turning round, found himself alone with the young man. 
The event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his
 ideas. He inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. 
d'Artagnan then repeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his 
remembrances of the present and the past, M. de Treville grasped the 
situation.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Pardon me," said he, smiling, "pardon me my dear
 compatriot, but I had wholly forgotten you. But what help is there for 
it! A captain is nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a 
greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers 
are big children; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and 
more particularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this 
smile M. de Treville judged that he had not to deal with a fool, and 
changing the conversation, came straight to the point.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I respected your father very much," said he. "What can I do for the son? Tell me quickly; my time is not my own."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur," said d'Artagnan, "on quitting Tarbes 
and coming hither, it was my intention to request of you, in remembrance
 of the friendship which you have not forgotten, the uniform of a 
Musketeer; but after all that I have seen during the last two hours, I 
comprehend that such a favor is enormous, and tremble lest I should not 
merit it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is indeed a favor, young man," replied M. de 
Treville, "but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or
 rather as you appear to believe. But his majesty's decision is always 
necessary; and I inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer 
without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant 
actions, or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored 
than ours."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his 
desire to don the Musketeer's uniform vastly increased by the great 
difficulties which preceded the attainment of it.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But," continued M. de Treville, fixing upon his 
compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read 
the thoughts of his heart, "on account of my old companion, your father,
 as I have said, I will do something for you, young man. Our recruits 
from Bearn are not generally very rich, and I have no reason to think 
matters have much changed in this respect since I left the province. I 
dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, "I ask alms of no man."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, that's very well, young man," continued M. 
de Treville, "that's all very well. I know these airs; I myself came to 
Paris with four crowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone 
who dared to tell me I was not in a condition to purchase the Louvre."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan's bearing became still more imposing. 
Thanks to the sale of his horse, he commenced his career with four more 
crowns than M. de Treville possessed at the commencement of his.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you
 have, however large the sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to 
perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a 
letter today to the Director of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will 
admit you without any expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little 
service. Our best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it 
without being able to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, 
swordsmanship in all its branches, and dancing. You will make some 
desirable acquaintances; and from time to time you can call upon me, 
just to tell me how you are getting on, and to say whether I can be of 
further service to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Alas, sir," said he, "I cannot but perceive how 
sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to 
present to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I certainly am surprised," replied M. de 
Treville, "that you should undertake so long a journey without that 
necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor Bearnese."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish," cried d'Artagnan; "but it was perfidiously stolen from me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He then related the adventure of Meung, described
 the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness, and all with a 
warmth and truthfulness that delighted M. de Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is all very strange," said M. de Treville, after meditating a minute; "you mentioned my name, then, aloud?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence;
 but why should I have done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a 
buckler to me on my way. Judge if I should not put myself under its 
protection."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Flattery was at that period very current, and M. 
de Treville loved incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He 
could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile 
soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of Meung, "Tell me," 
continued he, "had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Was he not a fine-looking man?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of lofty stature."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of complexion and brown hair?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you 
are acquainted with this man? If I ever find him again--and I will find 
him, I swear, were it in hell!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He was waiting for a woman," continued Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You know not the subject of their conversation?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Was this woman English?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He called her Milady."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is he; it must be he!" murmured Treville. "I believed him still at Brussels."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, sir, if you know who this man is," cried 
d'Artagnan, "tell me who he is, and whence he is. I will then release 
you from all your promises--even that of procuring my admission into the
 Musketeers; for before everything, I wish to avenge myself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Beware, young man!" cried Treville. "If you see 
him coming on one side of the street, pass by on the other. Do not cast 
yourself against such a rock; he would break you like glass."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That will not prevent me," replied d'Artagnan, "if ever I find him."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In the meantime," said Treville, "seek him not--if I have a right to advise you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a
 sudden suspicion. This great hatred which the young traveler manifested
 so loudly for this man, who--a rather improbable thing--had stolen his 
father's letter from him--was there not some perfidy concealed under 
this hatred? Might not this young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he 
not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended 
d'Artagnan--was he not an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal 
sought to introduce into Treville's house, to place near him, to win his
 confidence, and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand 
other instances? He fixed his eyes upon d'Artagnan even more earnestly 
than before. He was moderately reassured however, by the aspect of that 
countenance, full of astute intelligence and affected humility. "I know 
he is a Gascon," reflected he, "but he may be one for the cardinal as 
well as for me. Let us try him."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My friend," said he, slowly, "I wish, as the son
 of an ancient friend--for I consider this story of the lost letter 
perfectly true--I wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may 
have remarked in my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of 
our policy. The king and the cardinal are the best of friends; their 
apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing 
that a compatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make
 his way, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into 
the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by 
it. Be assured that I am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and
 that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the 
king, and also the cardinal--one of the most illustrious geniuses that 
France has ever produced.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now, young man, regulate your conduct 
accordingly; and if you entertain, whether from your family, your 
relations, or even from your instincts, any of these enmities which we 
see constantly breaking out against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let 
us separate. I will aid you in many ways, but without attaching you to 
my person. I hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend; 
for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have 
done to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Treville said to himself: "If the cardinal has 
set this young fox upon me, he will certainly not have failed--he, who 
knows how bitterly I execrate him--to tell his spy that the best means 
of making his court to me is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all 
my protestations, if it be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure 
me that he holds his Eminence in horror."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It, however, proved otherwise. D'Artagnan 
answered, with the greatest simplicity: "I came to Paris with exactly 
such intentions. My father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, 
the cardinal, and yourself--whom he considered the first three 
personages in France."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan added M. de Treville to the others, as may be perceived; but he thought this addition would do no harm.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have the greatest veneration for the 
cardinal," continued he, "and the most profound respect for his actions.
 So much the better for me, sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with 
frankness--for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance 
of our opinions; but if you have entertained any doubt, as naturally you
 may, I feel that I am ruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still
 trust you will not esteem me the less for it, and that is my object 
beyond all others."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville was surprised to the greatest 
degree. So much penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but 
did not entirely remove his suspicions. The more this young man was 
superior to others, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive
 him; "You are an honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do 
for you that which I just now offered. My hotel will be always open to 
you. Hereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently 
to take advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that 
which you desire."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is to say," replied d'Artagnan, "that you 
will wait until I have proved myself worthy of it. Well, be assured," 
added he, with the familiarity of a Gascon, "you shall not wait long." 
And he bowed in order to retire, and as if he considered the future in 
his own hands.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But wait a minute," said M. de Treville, 
stopping him. "I promised you a letter for the director of the Academy. 
Are you too proud to accept it, young gentleman?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, sir," said d'Artagnan; "and I will guard it 
so carefully that I will be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and 
woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville smiled at this flourish; and 
leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window, where 
they had talked together, he seated himself at a table in order to write
 the promised letter of recommendation. While he was doing this, 
d'Artagnan, having no better employment, amused himself with beating a 
march upon the window and with looking at the Musketeers, who went away,
 one after another, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville, after having written the letter, 
sealed it, and rising, approached the young man in order to give it to 
him. But at the very moment when d'Artagnan stretched out his hand to 
receive it, M. de Treville was highly astonished to see his protege make
 a sudden spring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet
 crying, "S'blood, he shall not escape me this time!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And who?" asked M. de Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He, my thief!" replied d'Artagnan. "Ah, the traitor!" and he disappeared.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The devil take the madman!" murmured M. de 
Treville, "unless," added he, "this is a cunning mode of escaping, 
seeing that he had failed in his purpose!"</span></p><br>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>4 THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF ARAMIS</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">D</span><span class="dropspan">'Artagnan</span><span>,
 in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds, and was 
darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending four at a 
time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost against a 
Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de Treville's private rooms, 
and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a cry, or rather a 
howl.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Excuse me," said d'Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, "excuse me, but I am in a hurry."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are in a hurry?" said the Musketeer, as pale
 as a sheet. "Under that pretense you run against me! You say. 'Excuse 
me,' and you believe that is sufficient? Not at all my young man. Do you
 fancy because you have heard Monsieur de Treville speak to us a little 
cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? 
Undeceive yourself, comrade, you are not Monsieur de Treville."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My faith!" replied d'Artagnan, recognizing 
Athos, who, after the dressing performed by the doctor, was returning to
 his own apartment. "I did not do it intentionally, and not doing it 
intentionally, I said 'Excuse me.' It appears to me that this is quite 
enough. I repeat to you, however, and this time on my word of honor--I 
think perhaps too often--that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your 
hold, then, I beg of you, and let me go where my business calls me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur," said Athos, letting him go, "you are not polite; it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos's last remark he stopped short.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"MORBLEU, monsieur!" said he, "however far I may come, it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Perhaps," said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after someone," said d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running--ME, you understand?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And where, I pray you?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Near the Carmes-Deschaux."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At what hour?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"About noon."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"About noon? That will do; I will be there."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut off your ears as you run."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good!" cried d'Artagnan, "I will be there ten 
minutes before twelve." And he set off running as if the devil possessed
 him, hoping that he might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could 
not have carried him far.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But at the street gate, Porthos was talking with 
the soldier on guard. Between the two talkers there was just enough room
 for a man to pass. D'Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he 
sprang forward like a dart between them. But d'Artagnan had reckoned 
without the wind. As he was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos's 
long cloak, and d'Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. 
Without doubt, Porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his 
vestments, for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he 
pulled it toward him, so that d'Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet
 by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished 
to escape from the cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way 
from under the folds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring
 the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on
 timidly opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between 
the two shoulders of Porthos--that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Alas, like most things in this world which have 
nothing in their favor but appearances, the baldric was glittering with 
gold in the front, but was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious 
as he was, Porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, 
but had at least half. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold 
and the urgency of the cloak.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Bless me!" cried Porthos, making strong efforts 
to disembarrass himself of d'Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back;
 "you must be mad to run against people in this manner."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Excuse me," said d'Artagnan, reappearing under 
the shoulder of the giant, "but I am in such haste--I was running after 
someone and--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And do you always forget your eyes when you run?" asked Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," replied d'Artagnan, piqued, "and thanks to my eyes, I can see what other people cannot see."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Whether Porthos understood him or did not 
understand him, giving way to his anger, "Monsieur," said he, "you stand
 a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Chastised, Monsieur!" said d'Artagnan, "the expression is strong."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, PARDIEU! I know full well that you don't turn your back to yours."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Presently, presently," cried the latter, "when you haven't your cloak on."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At one o'clock, then, behind the Luxembourg."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very well, at one o'clock, then," replied d'Artagnan, turning the angle of the street.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But neither in the street he had passed through, 
nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; 
however slowly the stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or 
perhaps had entered some house. D'Artagnan inquired of everyone he met 
with, went down to the ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the
 Red Cross; but nothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, 
advantageous to him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration 
broke from his forehead, his heart began to cool.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He began to reflect upon the events that had 
passed; they were numerous and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven 
o'clock in the morning, and yet this morning had already brought him 
into disgrace with M. de Treville, who could not fail to think the 
manner in which d'Artagnan had left him a little cavalier.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good 
duels with two men, each capable of killing three d'Artagnans--with two 
Musketeers, in short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so 
greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by 
Athos, it may easily be understood that the young man was not very 
uneasy about Porthos. As hope, however, is the last thing extinguished 
in the heart of man, he finished by hoping that he might survive, even 
though with terrible wounds, in both these duels; and in case of 
surviving, he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct:</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I 
am! That brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder 
against which I must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that 
astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good 
cause to do so; the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to 
Porthos--oh, as to Porthos, faith, that's a droll affair!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And in spite of himself, the young man began to 
laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary 
laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"As to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am
 not the less a giddy fool. Are people to be run against without 
warning? No! And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to 
see what is not there? He would have pardoned me, he would certainly 
have pardoned me, if I had not said anything to him about that cursed 
baldric--in ambiguous words, it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. 
Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I get from one hobble into another. Friend 
d'Artagnan," continued he, speaking to himself with all the amenity that
 he thought due himself, "if you escape, of which there is not much 
chance, I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the 
future. You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it. To 
be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward. Look at
 Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness and grace personified. Well, did 
anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward? No, certainly not, and 
from this moment I will endeavor to model myself after him. Ah! That's 
strange! Here he is!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had 
arrived within a few steps of the hotel d'Arguillon and in front of that
 hotel perceived Aramis, chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he 
had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that M. de 
Treville had been so angry in the morning, and as a witness of the 
rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all 
agreeable, he pretended not to see him. D'Artagnan, on the contrary, 
quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy, approached the 
young men with a profound bow, accompanied by a most gracious smile. All
 four, besides, immediately broke off their conversation.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive 
that he was one too many; but he was not sufficiently broken into the 
fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly 
from a false position, like that of a man who begins to mingle with 
people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does 
not concern him. He was seeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward
 means of retreat, when he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief
 fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had placed his foot upon it. This 
appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion. He 
stooped, and with the most gracious air he could assume, drew the 
handkerchief from under the foot of the Musketeer in spite of the 
efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out to him, said, 
"I believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to 
lose?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, 
and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed 
excessively, and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the 
hand of the Gascon.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, ah!" cried one of the Guards, "will you 
persist in saying, most discreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms 
with Madame de Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to 
lend you one of her handkerchiefs?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Aramis darted at d'Artagnan one of those looks 
which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming 
his mild air, "You are deceived, gentlemen," said he, "this handkerchief
 is not mine, and I cannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head
 to offer it to me rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I 
say, here is mine in my pocket."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, 
likewise a very elegant handkerchief, and of fine cambric--though 
cambric was dear at the period--but a handkerchief without embroidery 
and without arms, only ornamented with a single cipher, that of its 
proprietor.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This time d'Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived 
his mistake; but the friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his 
denial, and one of them addressed the young Musketeer with affected 
seriousness. "If it were as you pretend it is," said he, "I should be 
forced, my dear Aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well 
know, Bois-Tracy is an intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the 
property of his wife to be sported as a trophy."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You make the demand badly," replied Aramis; "and
 while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on 
account of the form."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The fact is," hazarded d'Artagnan, timidly, "I 
did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He
 had his foot upon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot 
upon it the handkerchief was his."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you were deceived, my dear sir," replied 
Aramis, coldly, very little sensible to the reparation. Then turning 
toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of 
Bois-Tracy, "Besides," continued he, "I have reflected, my dear intimate
 of Bois-Tracy, that I am not less tenderly his friend than you can 
possibly be; so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have 
fallen from your pocket as mine."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, upon my honor!" cried his Majesty's Guardsman.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are about to swear upon your honor and I 
upon my word, and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will 
have lied. Now, here, Montaran, we will do better than that--let each 
take a half."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of the handkerchief?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Perfectly just," cried the other two Guardsmen, "the judgment of King Solomon! Aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The young men burst into a laugh, and as may be 
supposed, the affair had no other sequel. In a moment or two the 
conversation ceased, and the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer, after 
having cordially shaken hands, separated, the Guardsmen going one way 
and Aramis another.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now is my time to make peace with this gallant 
man," said d'Artagnan to himself, having stood on one side during the 
whole of the latter part of the conversation; and with this good feeling
 drawing near to Aramis, who was departing without paying any attention 
to him, "Monsieur," said he, "you will excuse me, I hope."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, monsieur," interrupted Aramis, "permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What, monsieur!" cried d'Artagnan, "and do you suppose--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I suppose, monsieur that you are not a fool, and
 that you knew very well, although coming from Gascony, that people do 
not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason. What the devil! Paris is 
not paved with cambric!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to 
mortify me," said d'Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit 
began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions. "I am from 
Gascony, it is true; and since you know it, there is no occasion to tell
 you that Gascons are not very patient, so that when they have begged to
 be excused once, were it even for a folly, they are convinced that they
 have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter," 
said Aramis, "is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel. Thank God, I am 
not a bravo! And being a Musketeer but for a time, I only fight when I 
am forced to do so, and always with great repugnance; but this time the 
affair is serious, for here is a lady compromised by you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"By US, you mean!" cried d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why did you so awkwardly let it fall?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will teach you how to behave yourself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And I will send you back to your Mass book, Master Abbe. Draw, if you please, and instantly--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not so, if you please, my good friend--not here,
 at least. Do you not perceive that we are opposite the Hotel 
d'Arguillon, which is full of the cardinal's creatures? How do I know 
that this is not his Eminence who has honored you with the commission to
 procure my head? Now, I entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, 
it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly. I wish to kill you, be at 
rest as to that, but to kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where 
you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. 
Take your handkerchief; whether it belongs to you or another, you may 
perhaps stand in need of it."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur is a Gascon?" asked Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes. Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently 
useless to Musketeers, I know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as I 
am only a Musketeer provisionally, I hold it good to be prudent. At two 
o'clock I shall have the honor of expecting you at the hotel of Monsieur
 de Treville. There I will indicate to you the best place and time."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two young men bowed and separated, Aramis 
ascending the street which led to the Luxembourg, while d'Artagnan, 
perceiving the appointed hour was approaching, took the road to the 
Carmes-Deschaux, saying to himself, "Decidedly I can't draw back; but at
 least, if I am killed, I shall be killed by a Musketeer."</span></p><br>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>5 THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">D</span><span class="dropspan">'Artagnan</span><span>
 was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to his 
appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with
 those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was formed to
 make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness 
or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally 
results from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man 
fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened--if conquered, he 
doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of 
foul play and want of courage.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now, we must have badly painted the character of 
our adventure seeker, or our readers must have already perceived that 
d'Artagnan was not an ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to 
himself that his death was inevitable, he did not make up his mind to 
die quietly, as one less courageous and less restrained might have done 
in his place. He reflected upon the different characters of men he had 
to fight with, and began to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, 
by means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air 
and austere bearing pleased him much. He flattered himself he should be 
able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he 
might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which,
 well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the astute 
Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should 
be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at
 least, by hitting him in the face, as Caesar recommended his soldiers 
do to those of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so 
proud.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In addition to this, d'Artagnan possessed that 
invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had 
implanted in his heart: "Endure nothing from anyone but the king, the 
cardinal, and Monsieur de Treville." He flew, then, rather than walked, 
toward the convent of the Carmes Dechausses, or rather Deschaux, as it 
was called at that period, a sort of building without a window, 
surrounded by barren fields--an accessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and 
which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had 
no time to lose.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>When d'Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot
 of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had 
been waiting about five minutes, and twelve o'clock was striking. He 
was, then, as punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous 
casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos, who still suffered grievously from his 
wound, though it had been dressed anew by M. de Treville's surgeon, was 
seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his 
feather even touching the ground.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur," said Athos, "I have engaged two of my
 friends as seconds; but these two friends are not yet come, at which I 
am astonished, as it is not at all their custom."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have no seconds on my part, monsieur," said 
d'Artagnan; "for having only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know 
no one but Monsieur de Treville, to whom I was recommended by my father,
 who has the honor to be, in some degree, one of his friends."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos reflected for an instant. "You know no one but Monsieur de Treville?" he asked.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, monsieur, I know only him."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, but then," continued Athos, speaking half to himself, "if I kill you, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not too much so," replied d'Artagnan, with a bow
 that was not deficient in dignity, "since you do me the honor to draw a
 sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me
 devilishly, I can tell you. But I will take the left hand--it is my 
custom in such circumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use 
either hand easily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a 
left-handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for 
it. I regret I did not inform you sooner of this circumstance."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have truly, monsieur," said d'Artagnan, bowing again, "a courtesy, for which, I assure you, I am very grateful."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You confuse me," replied Athos, with his 
gentlemanly air; "let us talk of something else, if you please. Ah, 
s'blood, how you have hurt me! My shoulder quite burns."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If you would permit me--" said d'Artagnan, with timidity.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What, monsieur?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have a miraculous balsam for wounds--a balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, I am sure that in less than three days 
this balsam would cure you; and at the end of three days, when you would
 be cured--well, sir, it would still do me a great honor to be your 
man."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity 
that did honor to his courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon 
his courage.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"PARDIEU, monsieur!" said Athos, "that's a 
proposition that pleases me; not that I can accept it, but a league off 
it savors of the gentleman. Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of 
the time of Charlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model.
 Unfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great emperor, we 
live in the times of the cardinal; and three days hence, however well 
the secret might be guarded, it would be known, I say, that we were to 
fight, and our combat would be prevented. I think these fellows will 
never come."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If you are in haste, monsieur," said d'Artagnan,
 with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to 
him to put off the duel for three days, "and if it be your will to 
dispatch me at once, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There is another word which pleases me," cried 
Athos, with a gracious nod to d'Artagnan. "That did not come from a man 
without a heart. Monsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee 
plainly that if we don't kill each other, I shall hereafter have much 
pleasure in your conversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so 
please you; I have plenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here
 is one of them, I believe."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What!" cried d'Artagnan, "is your first witness Monsieur Porthos?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, that disturbs you?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"By no means."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And here is the second."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What!" cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before, "your second witness is Monsieur Aramis?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Doubtless! Are you not aware that we are never 
seen one without the others, and that we are called among the Musketeers
 and the Guards, at court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, 
or the Three Inseparables? And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"From Tarbes," said d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact," said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My faith!" replied d'Artagnan, "you are well 
named, gentlemen; and my adventure, if it should make any noise, will 
prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then turning toward d'Artagnan, stood quite astonished.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, ah!" said he, "what does this mean?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is the gentleman I am going to fight with,"
 said Athos, pointing to d'Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with 
the same gesture.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, it is with him I am also going to fight," said Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But not before one o'clock," replied d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And I also am to fight with this gentleman," said Aramis, coming in his turn onto the place.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But not until two o'clock," said d'Artagnan, with the same calmness.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But what are you going to fight about, Athos?" asked Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Faith! I don't very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Faith! I am going to fight--because I am going to fight," answered Porthos, reddening.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a 
faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, 
"We had a short discussion upon dress."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you, Aramis?" asked Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, ours is a theological quarrel," replied Aramis, making a sign to d'Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d'Artagnan.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed?" said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree," said the Gascon.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Decidedly, this is a clever fellow," murmured Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And now you are assembled, gentlemen," said d'Artagnan, "permit me to offer you my apologies."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this word APOLOGIES, a cloud passed over the 
brow of Athos, a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative
 sign was the reply of Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You do not understand me, gentlemen," said 
d'Artagnan, throwing up his head, the sharp and bold lines of which were
 at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun. "I asked to be excused
 in case I should not be able to discharge my debt to all three; for 
Monsieur Athos has the right to kill me first, which must much diminish 
the face-value of your bill, Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost 
null, Monsieur Aramis. And now, gentlemen, I repeat, excuse me, but on 
that account only, and--on guard!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At these words, with the most gallant air possible, d'Artagnan drew his sword.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The blood had mounted to the head of d'Artagnan, 
and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the 
Musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos, 
Porthos, and Aramis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its 
zenith, and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its
 full ardor.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is very hot," said Athos, drawing his sword 
in its turn, "and yet I cannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt 
my wound begin to bleed again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur 
with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is true, Monsieur," replied d'Artagnan, 
"and whether drawn by myself or another, I assure you I shall always 
view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman. I will therefore 
fight in my doublet, like yourself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, come, enough of such compliments!" cried Porthos. "Remember, we are waiting for our turns."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Speak for yourself when you are inclined to 
utter such incongruities," interrupted Aramis. "For my part, I think 
what they say is very well said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"When you please, monsieur," said Athos, putting himself on guard.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I waited your orders," said d'Artagnan, crossing swords.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a 
company of the Guards of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned
 the corner of the convent.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The cardinal's Guards!" cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time. "Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Halloo!" cried Jussac, advancing toward them and
 making a sign to his men to do so likewise, "halloo, Musketeers? 
Fighting here, are you? And the edicts? What is become of them?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,"
 said Athos, full of rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the
 preceding day. "If we were to see you fighting, I can assure you that 
we would make no effort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you 
will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Gentlemen," said Jussac, "it is with great 
regret that I pronounce the thing impossible. Duty before everything. 
Sheathe, then, if you please, and follow us."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur," said Aramis, parodying Jussac, "it 
would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it 
depended upon ourselves; but unfortunately the thing is 
impossible--Monsieur de Treville has forbidden it. Pass on your way, 
then; it is the best thing to do."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This raillery exasperated Jussac. "We will charge upon you, then," said he, "if you disobey."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There are five of them," said Athos, half aloud,
 "and we are but three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the 
spot, for, on my part, I declare I will never appear again before the 
captain as a conquered man."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while Jussac drew up his soldiers.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This short interval was sufficient to determine 
d'Artagnan on the part he was to take. It was one of those events which 
decide the life of a man; it was a choice between the king and the 
cardinal--the choice made, it must be persisted in. To fight, that was 
to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was to make at one 
blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself. All 
this young man perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not
 hesitate a second. Turning towards Athos and his friends, "Gentlemen," 
said he, "allow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you 
were but three, but it appears to me we are four."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But you are not one of us," said Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's true," replied d'Artagnan; "I have not 
the uniform, but I have the spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I 
feel it, monsieur, and that impels me on."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Withdraw, young man," cried Jussac, who 
doubtless, by his gestures and the expression of his countenance, had 
guessed d'Artagnan's design. "You may retire; we consent to that. Save 
your skin; begone quickly."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan did not budge.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Decidedly, you are a brave fellow," said Athos, pressing the young man's hand.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, come, choose your part," replied Jussac.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well," said Porthos to Aramis, "we must do something."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur is full of generosity," said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But all three reflected upon the youth of d'Artagnan, and dreaded his inexperience.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We should only be three, one of whom is wounded,
 with the addition of a boy," resumed Athos; "and yet it will not be the
 less said we were four men."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, but to yield!" said Porthos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That IS difficult," replied Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Try me, gentlemen," said he, "and I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are conquered."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What is your name, my brave fellow?" said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"d'Artagnan, monsieur."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan, forward!" cried Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, gentlemen, have you decided?" cried Jussac for the third time.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is done, gentlemen," said Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And what is your choice?" asked Jussac.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are about to have the honor of charging you,"
 replied Aramis, lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword 
with the other.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! You resist, do you?" cried Jussac.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"S'blood; does that astonish you?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of
 the cardinal's. Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed 
to two adversaries. As to d'Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would
 burst through his side--not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the 
shade of it, but with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning
 ten times round his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard 
twenty times. Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had 
much practice; nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself 
against an adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant 
from received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet 
parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This contest at length exhausted Jussac's 
patience. Furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a
 boy, he became warm and began to make mistakes. D'Artagnan, who though 
wanting in practice had a sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, 
anxious to put an end to this, springing forward, aimed a terrible 
thrust at his adversary, but the latter parried it; and while Jussac was
 recovering himself, glided like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed
 his sword through his body. Jussac fell like a dead mass.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the
 other pressed him warmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation,
 and able to defend himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. 
Porthos had received a thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through 
his thigh. But neither of these two wounds was serious, and they only 
fought more earnestly.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently 
paler, but did not give way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and 
fought with his left hand.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>According to the laws of dueling at that period, 
d'Artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was 
endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need, 
he caught a glance from Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. 
Athos would have died rather than appeal for help; but he could look, 
and with that look ask assistance. D'Artagnan interpreted it; with a 
terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac, crying, "To me, 
Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay you!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Cahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone supported him, sank upon his knee.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"S'blood!" cried he to d'Artagnan, "do not kill 
him, young man, I beg of you. I have an old affair to settle with him 
when I am cured and sound again. Disarm him only--make sure of his 
sword. That's it! Very well done!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing 
the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from him. D'Artagnan and Cahusac 
sprang forward at the same instant, the one to recover, the other to 
obtain, the sword; but d'Artagnan, being the more active, reached it 
first and placed his foot upon it.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom 
Aramis had killed, seized his rapier, and returned toward d'Artagnan; 
but on his way he met Athos, who during his relief which d'Artagnan had 
procured him had recovered his breath, and who, for fear that d'Artagnan
 would kill his enemy, wished to resume the fight.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging
 Athos not to leave him alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a
 sword thrust through his throat.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. 
Porthos made a thousand flourishes, asking Bicarat what o'clock it could
 be, and offering him his compliments upon his brother's having just 
obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he
 gained nothing. Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The 
watch might come up and take all the combatants, wounded or not, 
royalists or cardinalists. Athos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan surrounded 
Bicarat, and required him to surrender. Though alone against all and 
with a wound in his thigh, Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who 
had risen upon his elbow, cried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a 
Gascon, as d'Artagnan was; he turned a deaf ear, and contented himself 
with laughing, and between two parries finding time to point to a spot 
of earth with his sword, "Here," cried he, parodying a verse of the 
Bible, "here will Bicarat die; for I only am left, and they seek my 
life."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But there are four against you; leave off, I command you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, if you command me, that's another thing," 
said Bicarat. "As you are my commander, it is my duty to obey." And 
springing backward, he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the 
necessity of surrendering it, threw the pieces over the convent wall, 
and crossed him arms, whistling a cardinalist air.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. 
The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to 
their sheaths. D'Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the 
only one left standing, he bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis's 
adversaries who was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The 
fourth, as we have said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying
 away four swords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with 
joy, toward the hotel of M. de Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width
 of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the 
end it became a triumphal march. The heart of d'Artagnan swam in 
delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If I am not yet a Musketeer," said he to his new
 friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville's hotel, 
"at least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven't I?"</span></p><br>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 3.00em">T</span><span class="dropspan">his</span><span>
 affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in 
public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost
 in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the 
Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the 
cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and 
could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville 
attended the king's gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was 
very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville
 at a distance--</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come here, Monsieur Captain," said he, "come 
here, that I may growl at you. Do you know that his Eminence has been 
making fresh complaints against your Musketeers, and that with so much 
emotion, that this evening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these 
Musketeers of yours are very devils--fellows to be hanged."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, sire," replied Treville, who saw at the 
first glance how things would go, "on the contrary, they are good 
creatures, as meek as lambs, and have but one desire, I'll be their 
warranty. And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards 
but in your majesty's service. But what are they to do? The Guards of 
Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them, and for 
the honor of the corps even, the poor young men are obliged to defend 
themselves."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Listen to Monsieur de Treville," said the king; 
"listen to him! Would not one say he was speaking of a religious 
community? In truth, my dear Captain, I have a great mind to take away 
your commission and give it to Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I 
promised an abbey. But don't fancy that I am going to take you on your 
bare word. I am called Louis the Just, Monsieur de Treville, and by and 
by, by and by we will see."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Wait, then, monsieur, wait," said the king; "I will not detain you long."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began 
to lose what he had won, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing 
Charlemagne--if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess 
our ignorance. The king therefore arose a minute after, and putting the 
money which lay before him into his pocket, the major part of which 
arose from his winnings, "La Vieuville," said he, "take my place; I must
 speak to Monsieur de Treville on an affair of importance. Ah, I had 
eighty louis before me; put down the same sum, so that they who have 
lost may have nothing to complain of. Justice before everything."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then turning toward M. de Treville and walking 
with him toward the embrasure of a window, "Well, monsieur," continued 
he, "you say it is his Eminence's Guards who have sought a quarrel with 
your Musketeers?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sire, as they always do."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear Captain, a judge must hear both sides."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good Lord! In the most simple and natural manner
 possible. Three of my best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, 
and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated, and who have,
 I dare affirm to the king, his service much at heart--three of my best 
soldiers, I say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of 
pleasure with a young fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them
 the same morning. The party was to take place at St. Germain, I 
believe, and they had appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when 
they were disturbed by de Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other 
Guardsmen, who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company 
without some ill intention against the edicts."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, ah! You incline me to think so," said the king. "There is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your 
Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in 
such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, you are right, Treville, you are right!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed 
their minds, and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred; for 
your Majesty cannot be ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the 
king and nobody but the king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, 
who belong to the cardinal."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, Treville, yes," said the king, in a 
melancholy tone; "and it is very sad, believe me, to see thus two 
parties in France, two heads to royalty. But all this will come to an 
end, Treville, will come to an end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen 
sought a quarrel with the Musketeers?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I say that it is probable that things have 
fallen out so, but I will not swear to it, sire. You know how difficult 
it is to discover the truth; and unless a man be endowed with that 
admirable instinct which causes Louis XIII to be named the Just--"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are right, Treville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers. They had a youth with them?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of
 the king's Musketeers--one of whom was wounded--and a youth not only 
maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the 
cardinal's Guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, this is a victory!" cried the king, all radiant, "a complete victory!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"One hardly a young man; but who, however, 
behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the 
liberty of recommending him to your Majesty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How does he call himself?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"d'Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my 
oldest friends--the son of a man who served under the king your father, 
of glorious memory, in the civil war."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you say this young man behaved himself well?
 Tell me how, Treville--you know how I delight in accounts of war and 
fighting."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>And Louis XIII twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his hip.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Sire," resumed Treville, "as I told you, 
Monsieur d'Artagnan is little more than a boy; and as he has not the 
honor of being a Musketeer, he was dressed as a citizen. The Guards of 
the cardinal, perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the 
corps, invited him to retire before they attacked."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"So you may plainly see, Treville," interrupted the king, "it was they who attacked?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is true, sire; there can be no more doubt 
on that head. They called upon him then to retire; but he answered that 
he was a Musketeer at heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that 
therefore he would remain with Messieurs the Musketeers."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Brave young man!" murmured the king.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, he did remain with them; and your Majesty 
has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the 
terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He who wounded Jussac!" cried the king, "he, a boy! Treville, that's impossible!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, sire, for once he found his master."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I will see this young man, Treville--I will see him; and if anything can be done--well, we will make it our business."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"When will your Majesty deign to receive him?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Tomorrow, at midday, Treville."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Shall I bring him alone?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, bring me all four together. I wish to thank 
them all at once. Devoted men are so rare, Treville, by the back 
staircase. It is useless to let the cardinal know."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sire."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You understand, Treville--an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden to fight, after all."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But this encounter, sire, is quite out of the 
ordinary conditions of a duel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that 
there were five of the cardinal's Guardsmen against my three Musketeers 
and Monsieur d'Artagnan."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is true," said the king; "but never mind, Treville, come still by the back staircase."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Treville smiled; but as it was indeed something 
to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master, he 
saluted the king respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of 
him.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>That evening the three Musketeers were informed 
of the honor accorded them. As they had long been acquainted with the 
king, they were not much excited; but d'Artagnan, with his Gascon 
imagination, saw in it his future fortune, and passed the night in 
golden dreams. By eight o'clock in the morning he was at the apartment 
of Athos.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready 
to go out. As the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had
 made a party with Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a 
tennis court situated near the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited 
d'Artagnan to follow them; and although ignorant of the game, which he 
had never played, he accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from
 nine o'clock in the morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two Musketeers were already there, and were 
playing together. Athos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, 
passed with d'Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them; but at 
the first effort he made, although he played with his left hand, he 
found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion. 
D'Artagnan remained, therefore, alone; and as he declared he was too 
ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving 
balls to one another without counting. But one of these balls, launched 
by Porthos' herculean hand, passed so close to d'Artagnan's face that he
 thought that if, instead of passing near, it had hit him, his audience 
would have been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him 
to present himself before the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his 
Gascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and 
Porthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he 
should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and 
took his place near the cord and in the gallery.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Unfortunately for d'Artagnan, among the 
spectators was one of his Eminence's Guardsmen, who, still irritated by 
the defeat of his companions, which had happened only the day before, 
had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He 
believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: "It 
is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for 
he is doubtless a Musketeer apprentice."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>D'Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung
 him, and fixed his eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made 
this insolent speech.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"PARDIEU," resumed the latter, twisting his 
mustache, "look at me as long as you like, my little gentleman! I have 
said what I have said."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And as since that which you have said is too 
clear to require any explanation," replied d'Artagnan, in a low voice, 
"I beg you to follow me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And when?" asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At once, if you please."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you know who I am, without doubt?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I? I am completely ignorant; nor does it much disquiet me."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You're in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would not be so pressing."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What is your name?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Bernajoux, at your service."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, then, Monsieur Bernajoux," said d'Artagnan, tranquilly, "I will wait for you at the door."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Go, monsieur, I will follow you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be 
observed that we go out together. You must be aware that for our 
undertaking, company would be in the way."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's true," said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Indeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all 
the world, d'Artagnan alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those 
which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts 
of the cardinal could not repress.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their 
game, and Athos was watching them with so much attention, that they did 
not even perceive their young companion go out, who, as he had told the 
Guardsman of his Eminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, 
the Guardsman descended in his turn. As d'Artagnan had no time to lose, 
on account of the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he 
cast his eyes around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his 
adversary, "My faith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is 
Bernajoux, to have only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never 
mind; be content, I will do my best. On guard!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But," said he whom d'Artagnan thus provoked, "it
 appears to me that this place is badly chosen, and that we should be 
better behind the Abbey St. Germain or in the Pre-aux-Clercs."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What you say is full of sense," replied 
d'Artagnan; "but unfortunately I have very little time to spare, having 
an appointment at twelve precisely. On guard, then, monsieur, on guard!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment
 paid to him twice. In an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and 
he sprang upon his adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he
 hoped to intimidate.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>But d'Artagnan had on the preceding day served 
his apprenticeship. Fresh sharpened by his victory, full of hopes of 
future favor, he was resolved not to recoil a step. So the two swords 
were crossed close to the hilts, and as d'Artagnan stood firm, it was 
his adversary who made the retreating step; but d'Artagnan seized the 
moment at which, in this movement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from 
the line. He freed his weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary 
on the shoulder. d'Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised 
his sword; but Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing 
blindly upon him, absolutely spitted himself upon d'Artagnan's sword. 
As, however, he did not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, 
but only broke away toward the hotel of M. de la Tremouille, in whose 
service he had a relative, d'Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of
 the last wound his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, 
without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when
 the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, 
two of the friends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after 
exchanging some words with d'Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the 
court, and fell upon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis 
quickly appeared in their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen 
attacked their young companion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and
 as the Guardsmen were only two against four, they began to cry, "To the
 rescue! The Hotel de la Tremouille!" At these cries, all who were in 
the hotel rushed out and fell upon the four companions, who on their 
side cried aloud, "To the rescue, Musketeers!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers
 were known to be enemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account 
of the hatred they bore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other 
companies than those which belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had 
called him, often took part with the king's Musketeers in these 
quarrels. Of three Guardsmen of the company of M. Dessessart who were 
passing, two came to the assistance of the four companions, while the 
other ran toward the hotel of M. de Treville, crying, "To the rescue, 
Musketeers! To the rescue!" As usual, this hotel was full of soldiers of
 this company, who hastened to the succor of their comrades. The MELEE 
became general, but strength was on the side of the Musketeers. The 
cardinal's Guards and M. de la Tremouille's people retreated into the 
hotel, the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their 
enemies from entering with them. As to the wounded man, he had been 
taken in at once, and, as we have said, in a very bad state.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers
 and their allies, and they even began to deliberate whether they should
 not set fire to the hotel to punish the insolence of M. de la 
Tremouille's domestics in daring to make a SORTIE upon the king's 
Musketeers. The proposition had been made, and received with enthusiasm,
 when fortunately eleven o'clock struck. D'Artagnan and his companions 
remembered their audience, and as they would very much have regretted 
that such an opportunity should be lost, they succeeded in calming their
 friends, who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones 
against the gates; but the gates were too strong. They soon tired of the
 sport. Besides, those who must be considered the leaders of the 
enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hotel
 of M. de Treville, who was waiting for them, already informed of this 
fresh disturbance.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Quick to the Louvre," said he, "to the Louvre 
without losing an instant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he
 is prejudiced by the cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a 
consequence of the affair of yesterday, and the two will pass off 
together."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville, accompanied by the four young 
fellows, directed his course toward the Louvre; but to the great 
astonishment of the captain of the Musketeers, he was informed that the 
king had gone stag hunting in the forest of St. Germain. M. de Treville 
required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice, and each time 
his companions saw his brow become darker.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Had his Majesty," asked he, "any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, your Excellency," replied the valet de 
chambre, "the Master of the Hounds came this morning to inform him that 
he had marked down a stag. At first the king answered that he would not 
go; but he could not resist his love of sport, and set out after 
dinner."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And the king has seen the cardinal?" asked M. de Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In all probability he has," replied the valet, 
"for I saw the horses harnessed to his Eminence's carriage this morning,
 and when I asked where he was going, they told me, 'To St. Germain.'"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He is beforehand with us," said M. de Treville. 
"Gentlemen, I will see the king this evening; but as to you, I do not 
advise you to risk doing so."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This advice was too reasonable, and moreover came
 from a man who knew the king too well, to allow the four young men to 
dispute it. M. de Treville recommended everyone to return home and wait 
for news.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>On entering his hotel, M. de Treville thought it 
best to be first in making the complaint. He sent one of his servants to
 M. de la Tremouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject 
the cardinal's Guardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for
 their audacity in making SORTIE against the king's Musketeers. But M. 
de la Tremouille--already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as 
we already know, Bernajoux was--replied that it was neither for M. de 
Treville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him, 
whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had 
endeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might 
last a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own 
opinion, M. de Treville thought of an expedient which might terminate it
 quietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Tremouille.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>He repaired, therefore, immediately to his hotel, and caused himself to be announced.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The two nobles saluted each other politely, for 
if no friendship existed between them, there was at least esteem. Both 
were men of courage and honor; and as M. de la Tremouille--a Protestant,
 and seeing the king seldom--was of no party, he did not, in general, 
carry any bias into his social relations. This time, however, his 
address, although polite, was cooler than usual.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur," said M. de Treville, "we fancy that 
we have each cause to complain of the other, and I am come to endeavor 
to clear up this affair."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have no objection," replied M. de la 
Tremouille, "but I warn you that I am well informed, and all the fault 
is with your Musketeers."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!" said Treville, "not to accept the proposal I am about to make to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Make it, monsieur, I listen."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How is Monsieur Bernajoux, your esquire's relative?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to 
the sword thrust in his arm, which is not dangerous, he has received 
another right through his lungs, of which the doctor says bad things."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But has the wounded man retained his senses?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Perfectly."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Does he talk?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"With difficulty, but he can speak."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure 
him, in the name of the God before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak
 the truth. I will take him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and 
will believe what he will say."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de la Tremouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Both descended to the chamber in which the 
wounded man lay. The latter, on seeing these two noble lords who came to
 visit him, endeavored to raise himself up in his bed; but he was too 
weak, and exhausted by the effort, he fell back again almost senseless.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de la Tremouille approached him, and made him 
inhale some salts, which recalled him to life. Then M. de Treville, 
unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded 
man, requested M. de la Tremouille to interrogate him himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>That happened which M. de Treville had foreseen. 
Placed between life and death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a 
moment of concealing the truth; and he described to the two nobles the 
affair exactly as it had passed.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was all that M. de Treville wanted. He 
wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence, took leave of M. de la 
Tremouille, returned to his hotel, and immediately sent word to the four
 friends that he awaited their company at dinner.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville entertained good company, wholly 
anticardinalist, though. It may easily be understood, therefore, that 
the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks 
that his Eminence's Guardsmen had received. Now, as d'Artagnan had been 
the hero of these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations
 fell, which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as 
good comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that could 
very well afford him his.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Toward six o'clock M. de Treville announced that 
it was time to go to the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by 
his Majesty was past, instead of claiming the ENTREE by the back stairs,
 he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber. The king 
had not yet returned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about 
half an hour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown 
open, and his Majesty was announced.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>At his announcement d'Artagnan felt himself 
tremble to the very marrow of his bones. The coming instant would in all
 probability decide the rest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed 
in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Louis XIII appeared, walking fast. He was in 
hunting costume covered with dust, wearing large boots, and holding a 
whip in his hand. At the first glance, d'Artagnan judged that the mind 
of the king was stormy.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This disposition, visible as it was in his 
Majesty, did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his
 pathway. In royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an 
angry eye than not to be seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did
 not hesitate to make a step forward. D'Artagnan on the contrary 
remained concealed behind them; but although the king knew Athos, 
Porthos, and Aramis personally, he passed before them without speaking 
or looking--indeed, as if he had never seen them before. As for M. de 
Treville, when the eyes of the king fell upon him, he sustained the look
 with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes; after 
which his Majesty, grumbling, entered his apartment.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Matters go but badly," said Athos, smiling; "and we shall not be made Chevaliers of the Order this time."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Wait here ten minutes," said M. de Treville; 
"and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out, 
return to my hotel, for it will be useless for you to wait for me 
longer."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter 
of an hour, twenty minutes; and seeing that M. de Treville did not 
return, went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>M de Treville entered the king's cabinet boldly, 
and found his Majesty in a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, 
beating his boot with the handle of his whip. This, however, did not 
prevent his asking, with the greatest coolness, after his Majesty's 
health.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Bad, monsieur, bad!" replied the king; "I am bored."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis 
XIII, who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say,
 "Monsieur So-and-so, let us weary ourselves together."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul,
 everything degenerates; and I don't know whether it is the game which 
leaves no scent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of 
ten branches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being 
taken--when St.-Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound
 the mort--crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a
 two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I have given 
up hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de Treville! I had 
but one gerfalcon, and he died day before yesterday."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your 
disappointment. The misfortune is great; but I think you have still a 
good number of falcons, sparrow hawks, and tiercets."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And not a man to instruct them. Falconers are 
declining. I know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art
 of venery. After me it will all be over, and people will hunt with 
gins, snares, and traps. If I had but the time to train pupils! But 
there is the cardinal always at hand, who does not leave me a moment's 
repose; who talks to me about Spain, who talks to me about Austria, who 
talks to me about England! Ah! A PROPOS of the cardinal, Monsieur de 
Treville, I am vexed with you!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was the chance at which M. de Treville 
waited for the king. He knew the king of old, and he knew that all these
 complaints were but a preface--a sort of excitation to encourage 
himself--and that he had now come to his point at last.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And in what have I been so unfortunate as to 
displease your Majesty?" asked M. de Treville, feigning the most 
profound astonishment.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?" 
continued the king, without directly replying to de Treville's question.
 "Is it for this I name you captain of my Musketeers, that they should 
assassinate a man, disturb a whole quarter, and endeavor to set fire to 
Paris, without your saying a word? But yet," continued the king, 
"undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters 
are in prison, and you come to tell me justice is done."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Sire," replied M. de Treville, calmly, "on the contrary, I come to demand it of you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And against whom?" cried the king.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Against calumniators," said M. de Treville.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! This is something new," replied the king. 
"Will you tell me that your three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and
 Aramis, and your youngster from Bearn, have not fallen, like so many 
furies, upon poor Bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a 
fashion that probably by this time he is dead? Will you tell me that 
they did not lay siege to the hotel of the Duc de la Tremouille, and 
that they did not endeavor to burn it?--which would not, perhaps, have 
been a great misfortune in time of war, seeing that it is nothing but a 
nest of Huguenots, but which is, in time of peace, a frightful example. 
Tell me, now, can you deny all this?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And who told you this fine story, sire?" asked Treville, quietly.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who 
should it be but he who watches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse 
myself, who conducts everything at home and abroad--in France as in 
Europe?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Your Majesty probably refers to God," said M. de Treville; "for I know no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of my only friend--of the cardinal."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"His Eminence is not his holiness, sire."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What do you mean by that, monsieur?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to
 say that he betrays me? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely 
that you accuse him!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I 
say that he is ill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your 
Majesty's Musketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not 
obtained his information from good sources."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Tremouille, from the duke himself. What do you say to that?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply 
interested in the question to be a very impartial witness; but so far 
from that, sire, I know the duke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer 
the matter to him--but upon one condition, sire."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is that your Majesty will make him come here,
 will interrogate him yourself, TETE-A-TETE, without witnesses, and that
 I shall see your Majesty as soon as you have seen the duke."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What, then! You will bind yourself," cried the king, "by what Monsieur de la Tremouille shall say?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sire."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You will accept his judgment?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Undoubtedly."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Any you will submit to the reparation he may require?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Certainly."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"La Chesnaye," said the king. "La Chesnaye!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Louis XIII's confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in reply to the call.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"La Chesnaye," said the king, "let someone go 
instantly and find Monsieur de la Tremouille; I wish to speak with him 
this evening."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between Monsieur de la Tremouille and myself?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Nobody, by the faith of a gentleman."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Tomorrow, then, sire?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Tomorrow, monsieur."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At what o'clock, please your Majesty?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At any hour you will."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Awaken me! Do you think I ever sleep, then? I 
sleep no longer, monsieur. I sometimes dream, that's all. Come, then, as
 early as you like--at seven o'clock; but beware, if you and your 
Musketeers are guilty."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If my Musketeers are guilty, sire, the guilty 
shall be placed in your Majesty's hands, who will dispose of them at 
your good pleasure. Does your Majesty require anything further? Speak, I
 am ready to obey."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason. Tomorrow, then, monsieur--tomorrow."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Till then, God preserve your Majesty!"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>However ill the king might sleep, M. de Treville 
slept still worse. He had ordered his three Musketeers and their 
companion to be with him at half past six in the morning. He took them 
with him, without encouraging them or promising them anything, and 
without concealing from them that their luck, and even his own, depended
 upon the cast of the dice.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>Arrived at the foot of the back stairs, he 
desired them to wait. If the king was still irritated against them, they
 would depart without being seen; if the king consented to see them, 
they would only have to be called.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>On arriving at the king's private antechamber, M.
 de Treville found La Chesnaye, who informed him that they had not been 
able to find M. de la Tremouille on the preceding evening at his hotel, 
that he returned too late to present himself at the Louvre, that he had 
only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the 
king.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>This circumstance pleased M. de Treville much, as
 he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate 
itself between M. de la Tremouille's testimony and himself.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away 
when the door of the king's closet opened, and M. de Treville saw M. de 
la Tremouille come out. The duke came straight up to him, and said: 
"Monsieur de Treville, his Majesty has just sent for me in order to 
inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my 
hotel. I have told him the truth; that is to say, that the fault lay 
with my people, and that I was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I 
have the good fortune to meet you, I beg you to receive them, and to 
hold me always as one of your friends."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur the Duke," said M. de Treville, "I was 
so confident of your loyalty that I required no other defender before 
his Majesty than yourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I 
thank you that there is still one man in France of whom may be said, 
without disappointment, what I have said of you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's well said," cried the king, who had heard
 all these compliments through the open door; "only tell him, Treville, 
since he wishes to be considered your friend, that I also wish to be one
 of his, but he neglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have 
seen him, and that I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him 
all this for me, for these are things which a king cannot say for 
himself."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Thanks, sire, thanks," said the duke; "but your 
Majesty may be assured that it is not those--I do not speak of Monsieur 
de Treville--whom your Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are 
most devoted to you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! You have heard what I said? So much the 
better, Duke, so much the better," said the king, advancing toward the 
door. "Ah! It is you, Treville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you 
the day before yesterday to bring them with you; why have you not done 
so?"</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"They are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid them come up."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is 
nearly eight o'clock, and at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, 
and return often. Come in, Treville."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he 
opened the door, the three Musketeers and d'Artagnan, conducted by La 
Chesnaye, appeared at the top of the staircase.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come in, my braves," said the king, "come in; I am going to scold you."</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Musketeers advanced, bowing, d'Artagnan following closely behind them.</span></p><br>
<p class="pnext"><span>"W
