 <h2>
 CHAPTER I. THE ARRIVAL OF VAL
 </h2>
 <p>
 In northern Montana there lies a great, lonely stretch of prairie land,
 gashed deep where flows the Missouri. Indeed, there are many such?big,
 impassive, impressive in their very loneliness, in summer given over to
 the winds and the meadow larks and to the shadows fleeing always over the
 hilltops. Wild range cattle feed there and grow sleek and fat for the fall
 shipping of beef. At night the coyotes yap quaveringly and prowl abroad
 after the long-eared jack rabbits, which bounce away at their
 hunger-driven approach. In winter it is not good to be there; even the
 beasts shrink then from the bleak, level reaches, and shun the still
 bleaker heights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But men will live anywhere if by so doing there is money to be gained, and
 so a town snuggled up against the northern rim of the bench land, where
 the bleakness was softened a bit by the sheltering hills, and a
 willow-fringed creek with wild rosebushes and chokecherries made a vivid
 green background for the meager huddle of little, unpainted buildings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the passengers on the through trains which watered at the red tank near
 the creek, the place looked crudely picturesque?interesting, so long
 as one was not compelled to live there and could retain a perfectly
 impersonal viewpoint. After five or ten minutes spent hi watching
 curiously the one little street, with the long hitching poles planted
 firmly and frequently down both sides?usually within a very few
 steps of a saloon door?and the horses nodding and stamping at the
 flies, and the loitering figures that appeared now and then in desultory
 fashion, many of them imagined that they understood the West and
 sympathized with it, and appreciated its bigness and its freedom from
 conventions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One slim young woman had just told the thin-faced school teacher on a
 vacation, with whom she had formed one of those evanescent traveling
 acquaintances, that she already knew the West, from instinct and from
 Manley's letters. She loved it, she said, because Manley loved it, and
 because it was to be her home, and because it was so big and so free. Out
 here one could think and grow and really live, she declared, with
 enthusiasm. Manley had lived here for three years, and his letters, she
 told the thin-faced teacher, were an education in themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The teacher had already learned that the slim young woman, with the
 yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, was going to marry
 Manley?she had forgotten his other name, though the young woman had
 mentioned it?and would live on a ranch, a cattle ranch. She smiled
 with somewhat wistful sympathy, and hoped the young woman would be happy;
 and the young woman waved her hand, with the glove only half pulled on,
 toward the shadow-dappled prairie and the willow-fringed creek, and the
 hills beyond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Happy!" she echoed joyously. "Could one be anything else, in such a
 country? And then?you don't know Manley, you see. It's horribly bad
 form, and undignified and all that, to prate of one's private affairs, but
 I just can't help bubbling over. I'm not looking for heaven, and I expect
 to have plenty of bumpy places in the trail?trail is anything that
 you travel over, out here; Manley has coached me faithfully?but I'm
 going to be happy. My mind is quite made up. Well, good-by?I'm so
 glad you happened to be on this train, and I wish I might meet you again.
 Isn't it a funny little depot? Oh, yes?thank you! I almost forgot
 that umbrella, and I might need it. Yes, I'll write to you?I should
 hate to drop out of your mind completely. Address me Mrs. Manley
 Fleetwood, Hope, Montana. Good-by?I wish?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She trailed off down the aisle with eyes shining, in the wake of the
 grinning porter. She hurried down the steps, glanced hastily along the
 platform, up at the car window where the faded little school teacher was
 smiling wearily down at her, waved her hand, threw a dainty little kiss,
 nodded a gay farewell, smiled vaguely at the conductor, who had been
 respectfully pleasant to her?and then she was looking at the rear
 platform of the receding train mechanically, not yet quite realizing why
 it was that her heart went heavy so suddenly. She turned then and looked
 about her in a surprised, inquiring fashion. Manley, it would seem, was
 not at hand to welcome her. She had expected his face to be the first she
 looked upon in that town, but she tried not to be greatly perturbed at his
 absence; so many things may detain one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that moment a young fellow, whose clothes emphatically proclaimed him a
 cowboy, came diffidently up to her, tilted his hat backward an inch or so,
 and left it that way, thereby unconsciously giving himself an air of
 candor which should have been reassuring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fleetwood was detained. You were expecting to?you're the lady he
 was expecting, aren't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had been looking questioningly at her violin box and two trunks
 standing on their ends farther down the platform, and she smiled vaguely
 without glancing at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I hope he isn't sick, or?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll take you over to the hotel, and go tell him you're here," he
 volunteered, somewhat curtly, and picked up her bag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thank you." This time her eyes grazed his face inattentively. She
 followed him down the rough steps of planking and up an extremely dusty
 road?one could scarcely call it a street?to an uninviting
 building with crooked windows and a high, false front of unpainted boards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young fellow opened a sagging door, let her pass into a narrow
 hallway, and from there into a stuffy, hopelessly conventional fifth-rate
 parlor, handed her the bag, and departed with another tilt of the hat
 which placed it at a different angle. The sentence meant for farewell she
 did not catch, for she was staring at a wooden-faced portrait upon an
 easel, the portrait of a man with a drooping mustache, and porky cheeks,
 and dead-looking eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I expected bearskin rugs, and antlers on the walls, and big
 fireplaces!" she remarked aloud, and sighed. Then she turned and pulled
 aside a coarse curtain of dusty, machine-made lace, and looked after her
 guide. He was just disappearing into a saloon across the street, and she
 dropped the curtain precipitately, as if she were ashamed of spying. "Oh,
 well?I've heard all cowboys are more or less intemperate," she
 excused, again aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down upon an atrocious red plush chair, and wrinkled her nose
 spitefully at the porky-cheeked portrait. "I suppose you're the
 proprietor," she accused, "or else the proprietor's son. I wish you
 wouldn't squint like that. If I have to stop here longer than ten minutes,
 I shall certainly turn you face to the wall." Whereupon, with another
 grimace, she turned her back upon it and looked out of the window. Then
 she stood up impatiently, looked at her watch, and sat down again upon the
 red plush chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He didn't tell me whether Manley is sick," she said suddenly, with some
 resentment. "He was awfully abrupt in his manner. Oh, you?" She
 rose, picked up an old newspaper from the marble-topped table with
 uncertain legs, and spread it ungently over the portrait upon the easel.
 Then she went to the window and looked out again. "I feel perfectly sure
 that cowboy went and got drunk immediately," she complained, drumming
 pettishly upon the glass. "And I don't suppose he told Manley at all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cowboy was innocent of the charge, however, and he was doing his
 energetic best to tell Manley. He had gone straight through the saloon and
 into the small room behind, where a man lay sprawled upon a bed in one
 corner. He was asleep, and his clothes were wrinkled as if he had lain
 there long. His head rested upon his folded arms, and he was snoring
 loudly. The young fellow went up and took him roughly by the shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here! I thought I told you to straighten up," he cried disgustedly. "Come
 alive! The train's come and gone, and your girl's waiting for you over to
 the hotel. D' you hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Uh-huh!" The man opened one eye, grunted, and closed it again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other yanked him half off the bed, and swore. This brought both eyes
 open, glassy with whisky and sleep. He sat wobbling upon the edge of the
 bed, staring stupidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't you get anything through you?" his tormentor exclaimed. "You want
 your girl to find out you're drunk? You got the license in your pocket.
 You're supposed to get spliced this evening?and look at you!" He
 turned and went out to the bartender.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you pour that coffee into him, like I told you?" he demanded.
 "We've got to get him steady on his pins <i>somehow!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bartender was sprawled half over the bar, apathetically reading the
 sporting news of a torn Sunday edition of an Eastern paper. He looked up
 from under his eyebrows and grunted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you going to pour coffee down a man that lays flat on his belly and
 won't open his mouth?" he inquired, in an injured tone. "Sleep's all he
 needs, anyway. He'll be all right by morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other snorted dissent. "He'll be all right by dark?or he'll feel
 a whole lot worse," he promised grimly. "Dig up some ice. And a good jolt
 of bromo, if you've got it?and a towel or two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bartender wearily pushed the paper to one side, reached languidly
 under the bar, and laid hold of a round blue bottle. Yawning
 uninterestedly, he poured a double portion of the white crystals into a
 glass, half filled another under the faucet of the water cooler, and held
 them out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dump that into him, then," he advised. "It'll help some, if you get it
 down. What's the sweat to get him married off to-day? Won't the girl
 wait?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never asked her. You pound up some ice and bring it in, will you?" The
 volunteer nurse kicked open the door into the little room and went in,
 hastily pouring the bromo seltzer from one glass to the other to keep it
 from foaming out of all bounds. His patient was still sitting upon the
 edge of the bed where he had left him, slumped forward with his head in
 his hands. He looked up stupidly, his eyes bloodshot and swollen of lid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'S the train come in yet?" he asked thickly. "'S you, is it, Kent?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The train's come, and your girl is waiting for you at the hotel. Here,
 throw this into you?and for God's sake, brace up! You make me tired.
 Drink her down quick?the foam's good for you. Here, you take the
 stuff in the bottom, too. Got it? Take off your coat, so I can get at you.
 You don't look much like getting married, and that's no josh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood shook his head with drunken gravity, and groaned. "I ought to be
 killed. Drunk to-day!" He sagged forward again, and seemed disposed to
 shed tears. "She'll never forgive me; she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent jerked him to his feet peremptorily. "Aw, look here! I'm trying to
 sober you up. You've got to do your part?see? Here's some ice in a
 towel?you get it on your head. Open up your shirt, so I can bathe
 your chest. Don't do any good to blubber around about it. Your girl can't
 hear you, and Jim and I ain't sympathetic. Set down in this chair, where
 we can get at you." He enforced his command with some vigor, and Fleetwood
 groaned again. But he shed no more tears, and he grew momentarily more
 lucid, as the treatment took effect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tears were being shed in the stuffy little hotel parlor. The young
 woman looked often at her watch, went into the hallway, and opened the
 outer door several times, meditating a search of the town, and drew back
 always with a timid fluttering of heart because it was all so crude and
 strange, and the saloons so numerous and terrifying in their very bald
 simplicity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was worried about Manley, and she wished that cowboy would come out of
 the saloon and bring her lover to her. She had never dreamed of being
 treated in this way. No one came near her?and she had secretly
 expected to cause something of a flutter in this little town they called
 Hope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Surely, young girls from the East, come out to get married to their
 sweethearts, weren't so numerous that they should be ignored. If there
 were other people in the hotel, they did not manifest their presence, save
 by disquieting noises muffled by intervening partitions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She grew thirsty, but she hesitated to explore the depths of this dreary
 abode, in fear of worse horrors than the parlor furniture, and all the
 places of refreshment which she could see from the window or the door
 looked terribly masculine and unmoral, and as if they did not know there
 existed such things as ice cream, or soda, or sherbet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was after an hour of this that the tears came, which is saying a good
 deal for her courage. It seemed to her then that Manley must be dead. What
 else could keep him so long away from her, after three years of
 impassioned longing written twice a week with punctilious regularity?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He knew that she was coming. She had telegraphed from St. Paul, and had
 received a joyful reply, lavishly expressed in seventeen words instead of
 the ten-word limit. And they were to have been married immediately upon
 her arrival.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That cowboy had known she was coming; he must also have known why Manley
 did not meet her, and she wished futilely that she had questioned him,
 instead of walking beside him without a word. He should have explained. He
 would have explained if he had not been so very anxious to get inside that
 saloon and get drunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had always heard that cowboys were chivalrous, and brave, and
 fascinating in their picturesque dare-deviltry, but from the lone specimen
 which she had met she could not see that they possessed any of those
 qualities. If all cowboys were like that, she hoped that she would not be
 compelled to meet any of them. And <i>why</i> didn't Manley come?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was then that an inner door?a door which she had wanted to open,
 but had lacked courage?squeaked upon its hinges, and an ill-kept
 bundle of hair was thrust in, topping a weather-beaten face and a scrawny
 little body. Two faded, inquisitive eyes looked her over, and the woman
 sidled in, somewhat abashed, but too curious to remain outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh yes!" She seemed to be answering some inner question. "I didn't know
 you was here." She went over and removed the newspaper from the portrait.
 "That breed girl of mine ain't got the least idea of how to straighten up
 a room," she observed complainingly. "I guess she thinks this picture was
 made to hang things on. I'll have to round her up again and tell her a few
 things. This is my first husband. He was in politics and got beat, and so
 he killed himself. He couldn't stand to have folks give him the laugh."
 She spoke with pride. "He was a real handsome man, don't you think? You
 mighta took off the paper; it didn't belong there, and he does brighten up
 the room. A good picture is real company, seems to me. When my old man
 gets on the rampage till I can't stand it no longer, I come in here and
 set, and look at Walt. 'T ain't every man that's got nerve to kill himself?with
 a shotgun. It was turrible! He took and tied a string to the trigger?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, please!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady stopped short and stared at her. "What? Oh, I won't go into
 details?it was awful messy, and that's a fact. I didn't git over it
 for a couple of months. He coulda killed himself with a six-shooter; it's
 always been a mystery why he dug up that old shotgun, but he did. I always
 thought he wanted to show his nerve." She sighed, and drew her fingers
 across her eyes. "I don't s'pose I ever will git over it," she added
 complacently. "It was a turrible shock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know," the girl began desperately, "if Mr. Manley Fleetwood is in
 town? I expected him to meet me at the train."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! I kinda <i>thought</i> you was Man Fleetwood's girl. My name's
 Hawley. You going to be married to-night, ain't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I haven't seen Mr. Fleetwood yet," hesitated the girl, and her
 eyes filled again with tears. "I'm afraid something may have happened to
 him. He?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Hawley glimpsed the tears, and instantly became motherly in her
 manner. She even went up and patted the girl on the shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, now, don't you worry none. Man's all right; I seen him at dinner
 time. He was?" She stopped short, looked keenly at the delicate
 face, and at the yellow-brown eyes which gazed back at her, innocent of
 evil, trusting, wistful. "He spoke about your coming, and said he'd want
 the use of the parlor this evening, for the wedding. I had an idea you was
 coming on the six-twenty train. Maybe he thought so, too. I never heard
 you come in?I was busy frying doughnuts in the kitchen?and I
 just happened to come in here after something. You'd oughta rapped on that
 door. Then I'd 'a' known you was here. I'll go and have my old man hunt
 him up. He must be around town somewheres. Like as not he'll meet the
 six-twenty, expecting you to be on it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She smiled reassuringly as she turned to the inner door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You take off your hat and jacket, and pretty soon I'll show you up to a
 room. I'll have to round up my old man first?and that's liable to
 take time." She turned her eyes quizzically to the porky-cheeked portrait.
 "You jest let Walt keep you company till I get back. He was real good
 company when he was livin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She smiled again and went out briskly, came back, and stood with her hand
 upon the cracked doorknob.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I clean forgot your name," she hinted. "Man told me, at dinner time, but
 I'm no good on earth at remembering names till after I've seen the person
 it belongs to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Valeria Peyson?Val, they call me usually, at home." The
 homesickness of the girl shone in her misty eyes, haunted her voice. Mrs.
 Hawley read it, and spoke more briskly than she would otherwise have done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we're plumb strangers, but we ain't going to stay that way, because
 every time you come to town you'll have to stop here; there ain't any
 other place to stop. And I'm going to start right in calling you Val. We
 don't use no ceremony with folk's names, out here. Val's a real nice name,
 short and easy to say. Mine's Arline. You can call me by it if you want
 to. I don't let everybody?so many wants to cut it down to Leen, and
 I won't stand for that; I'm <i>lean</i> enough, without havin' it throwed
 up to me. We might jest as well start in the way we're likely to keep it
 up, and you won't feel so much like a stranger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm awful glad you're going to settle here?there ain't so awful
 many women in the country; we have to rake and scrape to git enough for
 three sets when we have a dance?and more likely we can't make out
 more 'n two. D' you dance? Somebody said they seen a fiddle box down to
 the depot, with a couple of big trunks; d' you play the fiddle?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little," Valeria smiled faintly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that'll come in awful handy at dances. We'd have 'em real often in
 the winter if it wasn't such a job to git music. Well, I got too much to
 do to be standin' here talkin'. I have to keep right after that breed girl
 all the time, or she won't do nothing. I'll git my old man after your
 fellow right away. Jest make yourself to home, and anything you want ask
 for it in the kitchen." She smiled in friendly fashion and closed the door
 with a little slam to make sure that it latched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valeria stood for a moment with her hands hanging straight at her sides,
 staring absently at the door. Then she glanced at Walt, staring
 wooden-faced from his gilt frame upon his gilt easel, and shivered. She
 pushed the red plush chair as far away from him as possible, sat down with
 her back to the picture, and immediately felt his dull, black eyes boring
 into her back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a fool I must be!" she said aloud, glancing reluctantly over her
 shoulder at the portrait. She got up resolutely, placed the chair where it
 had stood before, and stared deliberately at Walt, as if she would prove
 how little she cared. But in a moment more she was crying dismally.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER II. WELL-MEANT ADVICE
 </h2>
 <p>
 Kent Burnett, bearing over his arm a coat newly pressed in the Delmonico
 restaurant, dodged in at the back door of the saloon, threw the coat down
 upon the tousled bed, and pushed back his hat with a gesture of relief at
 an onerous duty well performed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I had one hell of a time," he announced plaintively, "and that Chink will
 likely try to poison me if I eat over there, after this?but I got
 her ironed, all right. Get into it, Man, and chase yourself over there to
 the hotel. Got a clean collar? That one's all-over coffee."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood stifled a groan, reached into a trousers pocket, and brought up
 a dollar. "Get me one at the store, will you, Kent? Fifteen and a half?and
 a tie, if they've got any that's decent. And hurry! Such a
 triple-three-star fool as I am ought to be taken out and shot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went on cursing himself audibly and bitterly, even after Kent had
 hurried out. He was sober now?was Manley Fleetwood?sober and
 self-condemnatory and penitent. His head ached splittingly; his eyes were
 heavy-lidded and bloodshot, and his hands trembled so that he could
 scarcely button his coat. But he was sober. He did not even carry the odor
 of whisky upon his breath or his person; for Kent had been very thoughtful
 and very thorough. He had compelled his patient to crunch and swallow many
 nauseous tablets of "whisky killer," and he had sprinkled his clothes
 liberally with Jockey Club; Fleetwood, therefore, while he emanated odors
 in plenty, carried about him none of the aroma properly belonging to
 intoxication.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In ten minutes Kent was back, with a celluloid collar and two ties of
 questionable taste. Manley just glanced at them, waved them away with
 gloomy finality, and swore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're just about the limit, and that's no dream," sympathized Kent,
 "but they're clean, and they don't look like they'd been slept in for a
 month. You've got to put 'em on?by George, I sized up the layout in
 both those imitation stores, and I drew the highest in the deck. And for
 the Lord's sake, get a move on. Here, I'll button it for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Behind Fleetwood's back, when collar and tie were in place, Kent grinned
 and lowered an eyelid at Jim, who put his head in from the saloon to see
 how far the sobering had progressed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You look fine!" he encouraged heartily. "That green-and-blue tie's just
 what you need to set you off. And the collar sure is shiny and nice?your
 girl will be plumb dazzled. She won't see anything wrong?believe <i>me</i>.
 Now, run along and get married. Here, you better sneak out the back way;
 if she happened to be looking out, she'd likely wonder what you were
 doing, coming out of a saloon. Duck out past the coal shed and cut into
 the street by Brinberg's. Tell her you're sick?got a sick headache.
 Your looks'll swear it's the truth. Hike!" He opened the door and pushed
 Fleetwood out, watched him out of sight around the corner of Brinberg's
 store, and turned back into the close-smelling little room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know," he remarked to Jim, "I never thought of it before, but I've
 been playing a low-down trick on that poor girl. I kinda wish now I'd put
 her next, and given her a chance to draw outa the game if she wanted to.
 It's stacking the deck on her, if you ask <i>me</i>!" He pushed his hat
 back upon his head, gave his shoulders a twist of dissatisfaction, and
 told Jim to dig up some Eastern beer; drank it meditatively, and set down
 the glass with some force.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir," he said disgustedly, "darn my fool soul, I stacked the deck on
 that girl?and she looked to be real nice. Kinda innocent and
 trusting, like she hasn't found out yet how rotten mean men critters can
 be." He took the bottle and poured himself another glass. "She's sure due
 to wise up a lot," he added grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet your sweet life!" Jim agreed, and then he reconsidered. "Still, I
 dunno; Man ain't so worse. He ain't what you can call a real booze
 fighter. This here's what I'd call an accidental jag; got it in the
 exuberance of the joyful moment when he knew his girl was coming. He'll
 likely straighten up and be all right. He?" Jim broke off there and
 looked to see who had opened the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Polly," he greeted carelessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man came forward, grinning skinnily. Polycarp Jenks was the outrageous
 name of him. He was under the average height, and he was lean to the point
 of emaciation. His mouth was absolutely curveless?a straight gash
 across his face; a gash which simply stopped short without any tapering or
 any turn at the corners, when it had reached as far as was decent. His
 nose was also straight and high, and owned no perceptible slope; indeed,
 it seemed merely a pendant attached to his forehead, and its upper
 termination was indefinite, except that somewhere between his eyebrows one
 felt impelled to consider it forehead rather than nose. His eyes also were
 rather long and narrow, like buttonholes cut to match the mouth. When he
 grinned his face appeared to break up into splinters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was intensely proud of his name, and his pleasure was almost pathetic
 when one pronounced it without curtailment in his presence. His skinniness
 was also a matter of pride. And when you realize that he was an
 indefatigable gossip, and seemed always to be riding at large, gathering
 or imparting trivial news, you should know fairly well Polycarp Jenks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see Man Fleetwood's might' near sober enough to git married," Polycarp
 began, coming up to the two and leaning a sharp elbow upon the bar beside
 Kent. "By granny, gitting married'd sober anybody! Dinner time he was so
 drunk he couldn't find his mouth. I met him up here a little ways just
 now, and he was so sober he remembered to pay me that ten I lent him t'
 other day?<i>he-he!</i> Open up a bottle of pop, James.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His girl's been might' near crying her eyes out, 'cause he didn't show
 up. Mis' Hawley says she looked like she was due at a funeral 'stid of a
 weddin'. 'Clined to be stuck up, accordin' to Mis' Hawley?shied at
 hearin' about Walt?<i>he-he!</i> I'll bet there ain't been a
 transient to that hotel in the last five year, man or woman, that ain't
 had to hear about Walt and the shotgun?Pop's all right on a hot day,
 you bet!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's got two trunks and a fiddle over to the depot?don't see how
 'n the world Man's going to git 'em out to the ranch; they're might' near
 as big as claim shacks, both of 'em. Time she gits 'em into Man's shack
 she'll have to go outside every time she wants to turn around?<i>he-he!</i>
 By granny?two trunks, to one woman! Have some pop, Kenneth, on me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The boys are talkin' about a shivaree t'-night. On the quiet, y' know.
 Some of 'em's workin' on a horse fiddle now, over in the lumber yard.
 Wanted me to play a coal-oil can, but I dunno. I'm gittin' a leetle old
 for sech doings. Keeps you up nights too much. Man had any sense, he'd
 marry and pull outa town. 'Bout fifteen or twenty in the bunch, and a
 string of cans and irons to reach clean across the street. By granny, I'm
 going to plug m' ears good with cotton when it comes off?<i>he-he!</i>
 'Nother bottle of pop, James."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's running the show, Polycarp?" Kent asked, accepting the glass of
 soda because he disliked to offend. "Funny I didn't hear about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp twisted his slit of a mouth knowingly, and closed one slit of an
 eye to assist the facial elucidation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't funny?not when I tell you Fred De Garmo's handing out the <i>in</i>vites,
 and he sure aims to have plenty of excitement?<i>he-he!</i> Betcher
 Manley won't be able to set on the wagon seat an' hold the lines t'-morrow?not
 if he comes out when he's called and does the thing proper?<i>he-he!</i>
 An' if he don't show up, they aim to jest about pull the old shebang down
 over his ears. Hope'll think it's the day of judgment, sure?<i>he-he!</i>
 Reckon I might's well git in on the fun?they won't be no sleepin'
 within ten mile of the place, nohow, and a feller always sees the joke
 better when he's lendin' a hand. Too bad you an' Fred's on the outs,
 Kenneth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know?it suits me fine," Kent declared easily, setting
 down his glass with a sigh of relief; he hated "pop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's it all about, anyway?" quizzed Polycarp, hungering for the details
 which had thus far been denied him. "De Garmo sees red whenever anybody
 mentions your name, Kenneth?but I never did hear no particulars."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?" Kent was turning toward the door. "Well, you see, Fred claims he can
 holler louder than I can, and I say he can't." He opened the door and
 calmly departed, leaving Polycarp looking exceedingly foolish and a bit
 angry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Straight to the hotel, without any pretense at disguising his destination,
 marched Kent. He went into the office?which was really a saloon?invited
 Hawley to drink with him, and then wondered audibly if he could beg some
 pie from Mrs. Hawley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Supper'll be ready in a few minutes," Hawley informed him, glancing up at
 the round, dust-covered clock screwed to the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want supper?I want pie," Kent retorted, and opened a door
 which led into the hallway. He went down the narrow passage to another
 door, opened it without ceremony, and was assailed by the odor of many
 things?the odor which spoke plainly of supper, or some other
 assortment of food. No one was in sight, so he entered the dining room
 boldly, stepped to another door, tapped very lightly upon it, and went in.
 By this somewhat roundabout method he invaded the parlor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley Fleetwood was lying upon an extremely uncomfortable couch, of the
 kind which is called a sofa. He had a lace-edged handkerchief folded upon
 his brow, and upon his face was an expression of conscious unworthiness
 which struck Kent as being extremely humorous. He grinned understandingly
 and Manley flushed?also understandingly. Valeria hastily released
 Manley's hand and looked very prim and a bit haughty, as she regarded the
 intruder from the red plush chair, pulled close to the couch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Fleetwood's head is very bad yet," she informed Kent coldly. "I
 really do not think he ought to see?anybody."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent tapped his hat gently against his leg and faced her unflinchingly,
 quite unconscious of the fact that she regarded him as a dissolute,
 drunken cowboy with whom Manley ought not to associate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's too bad." His eyes failed to drop guiltily before hers, but
 continued to regard her calmly. "I'm only going to stay a minute. I came
 to tell you that there's a scheme to raise?to 'shivaree' you two,
 tonight. I thought you might want to pull out, along about dark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley looked up at him inquiringly with the eye which was not covered by
 the lace-edged handkerchief. Valeria seemed startled, just at first. Then
 she gave Kent a little shock of surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have read about such things. A <i>charivari</i>, even out here in this
 uncivilized section of the country, can hardly be dangerous. I really do
 not think we care to run away, thank you." Her lip curled unmistakably.
 "Mr. Fleetwood is suffering from a sick headache. He needs rest?not
 a cowardly night ride."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Naturally Kent admired the spirit she showed, in spite of that eloquent
 lip, the scorn of which seemed aimed directly at him. But he still faced
 her steadily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. But if I had a headache?like that?I'd certainly burn
 the earth getting outa town to-night. <i>Shivarees</i>"?he stuck
 stubbornly to his own way of saying it?"are bad for the head. They
 aren't what you could call silent?not out here in this uncivilized
 section of the country. They're plumb?" He hesitated for just a
 fraction of a second, and his resentment of her tone melted into a twinkle
 of the eyes. "They've got fifty coal-oil cans strung with irons on a rope,
 and there'll be about ninety-five six-shooters popping, and eight or ten
 horse-fiddles, and they'll all be yelling to beat four of a kind. They're
 going," he said quite gravely, "to play the full orchestra. And I don't
 believe," he added ironically, "it's going to help Mr. Fleetwood's head
 any."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valeria looked at him doubtingly with steady, amber-colored eyes before
 she turned solicitously to readjust the lace-edged handkerchief. Kent
 seized the opportunity to stare fixedly at Fleetwood and jerk his head
 meaningly backward, but when, warned by Manley's changing expression, she
 glanced suspiciously over her shoulder, Kent was standing quietly by the
 door with his hat in his hand, gazing absently at Walt in his gilt-edged
 frame upon the gilt easel, and waiting, evidently, for their decision.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall tell them that Mr. Fleetwood is sick?that he has a horrible
 headache, and mustn't be disturbed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent forgot himself so far as to cough slightly behind his hand. Valeria's
 eyes sparkled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Even out here," she went on cuttingly, "there must be some men who are
 gentlemen!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent refrained from looking at her, but the blood crept darkly into his
 tanned cheeks. Evidently she "had it in for him," but he could not see
 why. He wondered swiftly if she blamed him for Manley's condition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood suddenly sat up, spilling the handkerchief to the floor. When
 Valeria essayed to push him back he put her hand gently away. He rose and
 came over to Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is this straight goods?" he demanded. "Why don't you stop it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fred De Garmo's running this show. My influence wouldn't go as far?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood turned to the girl, and his manner was masterful. "I'm going out
 with Kent?oh, Val, this is Mr. Burnett. Kent, Miss Peyson. I forgot
 you two aren't acquainted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From Valeria's manner, they were in no danger of becoming friends. Her
 acknowledgment was barely perceptible. Kent bowed stiffly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to see about this, Val," continued Fleetwood. "Oh, my head's
 better?a lot better, really. Maybe we'd better leave town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If your head is better, I don't see why we need run away from a lot of
 silly noise," Valeria interposed, with merciless logic. "They'll think
 we're awful cowards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll try and find out?I won't be gone a minute, dear." After
 that word, spoken before another, he appeared to be in great haste, and
 pushed Kent rather unceremoniously through the door. In the dining room,
 Kent diplomatically included the landlady in the conference, by a gesture
 of much mystery bringing her in from the kitchen, where she had been
 curiously peeping out at them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got to let her in," he whispered to Manley, "to keep her face closed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They murmured together for five minutes. Kent seemed to meet with some
 opposition from Fleetwood?an aftermath of Valeria's objections to
 flight?and became brutally direct.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go ahead?do as you please," he said roughly. "But you know that
 bunch. You'll have to show up, and you'll have to set 'em up, and?aw,
 thunder! By morning you'll be plumb laid out. You'll be headed into one of
 your four-day jags, and you know it. I was thinking of the girl?but
 if you don't care, I guess it's none of my funeral. Go to it?but
 darned if I'd want to start my honeymoon out like that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood weakened, but still he hesitated. "If I didn't show up?"
 he began hopefully. But Kent wittered him with a look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That bunch will be two-thirds full before they start out. If you don't
 show up, they'll go up and haul you outa bed?hell, Man! You'd likely
 start in to kill somebody off. Fred De Garmo don't love you much better
 than he loves me. You know what him and his friends would do then, I
 should think." He stopped, and seemed to consider briefly a plan, but
 shook his head over it. "I could round up a bunch and stand 'em off, maybe?but
 we'd be shooting each other up, first rattle of the box. It's a whole lot
 easier for you to get outa town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell somebody you got the bridal chamber," hissed Arline, in a very
 loud whisper. "That's number two, in front. I can keep a light going and
 pass back 'n' forth once in a while, to look like you're there. That'll
 fool 'em good. They'll wait till the light's been out quite a while before
 they start in. You go ahead and git married at seven, jest as you was
 going to?and if Kent'll have the team ready somewheres, I can easy
 sneak you out the back way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I couldn't get the team out of town without giving the whole deal away,"
 Kent objected. "You'll have to go horseback.".
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val can't ride," Fleetwood stated, as if that settled the matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Damn it, she's got to ride!" snapped Kent, losing patience. "Unless you
 want to stay and go on a toot that'll last a week, most likely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val belongs to the W.C.T.U.," shrugged Fleetwood. "She'd never?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's that or have a fight on your hands you maybe can't handle. I
 don't see any sense in haggling about going, now you know what to expect.
 But, of course," he added, with some acrimony, "it's your own business. I
 don't know what the dickens I'm getting all worked up over it for. Suit
 yourself." He turned toward the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She could ride my Mollie?and I got a sidesaddle hanging up in the
 coal shed. She could use that, or a stock saddle, either one," planned
 Mrs. Hawley anxiously. "You better pull out, Man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on, Kent! Don't rush off?we'll go," Fleetwood surrendered.
 "Val won't like it, but I'll explain as well as I can, without?Say!
 you stay and see us married, won't you? It's at seven, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent's fingers curled around the doorknob. "No, thanks. Weddings and
 funerals are two bunches of trouble I always ride 'way around. Time enough
 when you've got to be <i>it</i>. Along about nine o'clock you try and get
 out to the stockyards without letting the whole town see you go, and I'll
 have the horses there; just beyond the wings, by that pile of ties. You
 know the place. I'll wait there till ten, and not a minute longer. That'll
 give you an hour, and you won't need any more time than that if you get
 down to business. You find out from her what saddle she wants, and you can
 tell me while I'm eating supper, Mrs. Hawley. I'll 'tend to the rest." He
 did not wait to hear whether they agreed to the plan, but went moodily
 down the narrow passage, and entered frowningly the "office." Several men
 were gathered there, waiting the supper summons. Hawley glanced up from
 wiping a glass, and grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, did you git the pie?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Naw. She said I'd got to wait for mealtime. She plumb chased me out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fred De Garmo, sprawled in an armchair and smoking a cigar, lazily fanned
 the smoke cloud from before his face and looked at Kent attentively.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER III. A LADY IN A TEMPER
 </h2>
 <p>
 To saddle two horses when the night has grown black and to lead them,
 unobserved, so short a distance as two hundred yards or so seems a simple
 thing; and for two healthy young people with full use of their wits and
 their legs to steal quietly away to where those horses are waiting would
 seem quite as simple. At the same time, to prevent the successful
 accomplishment of these things is not difficult, if one but fully
 understands the designs of the fugitives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hawley Hotel did a flourishing business that night. The two long tables in
 the dining room, usually not more than half filled by those who hungered
 and were not over-nice concerning the food they ate, were twice filled to
 overflowing. Mrs. Hawley and the "breed" girl held hasty consultations in
 the kitchen over the supply, and never was there such a rattling of dishes
 hurriedly cleansed for the next comer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent managed to find a chair at the first table, and eyed the landlady
 unobtrusively. But Fred De Garmo sat down opposite, and his eyes were
 bright and watchful, so that there seemed no possible way of delivering a
 message undetected?until, indeed, Mrs. Hawley in desperation
 resorted to strategy, and urged Kent unnecessarily to take another slice
 of bacon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have some more?it's <i>side</i>!" she hissed in his ear, and
 watched anxiously his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," said Kent, and speared a slice with his fork, although his
 plate was already well supplied with bacon. Then, glancing up, he detected
 Fred in a thoughtful stare which seemed evenly divided between the
 landlady and himself. Kent was conscious of a passing, mental discomfort,
 which he put aside as foolish, because De Garmo could not possibly know
 what Mrs. Hawley meant. To ease his mind still further he glared
 insolently at Fred, and then at Polycarp Jenks <i>te-hee</i>ing a few
 chairs away. After that he finished as quickly as possible without
 exciting remark, and went his way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had not, however, been two minutes in the office before De Garmo
 entered. From that time on through the whole evening Fred was never far
 distant; wherever he went, Kent could not shake him off though De Garmo
 never seemed to pay any attention to him, and his presence was always
 apparently accidental.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon I'll have to lick that son of a gun yet," sighed Kent, when a
 glance at the round clock in the hotel office told him that in just twenty
 minutes it would strike nine; and not a move made toward getting those
 horses saddled and out to the stockyards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was much talk of the wedding, which had taken place quietly in the
 parlor at the appointed hour, but not a man mentioned a <i>charivari</i>.
 There were many who wished openly that Fleetwood would come out and be
 sociable about it, but not a hint that they intended to take measures to
 bring him among them. He had caused a box of cigars to be placed upon the
 bar of every saloon in town, where men might help themselves at his
 expense. Evidently he had considered that with the cigars his social
 obligations were canceled. They smoked the cigars, and, with the same
 breath, gossiped of him and his affairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At just fourteen minutes to nine Kent went out, and, without any attempt
 at concealment, hurried to the Hawley stables. Half a minute behind him
 trailed De Garmo, also without subterfuge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Half an hour later the bridal couple stole away from the rear of the
 hotel, and, keeping to the shadows, went stumbling over the uneven ground
 to the stockyards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's the tie pile," Fleetwood announced, in an undertone, when they
 reached the place. "You stay here, Val, and I'll look farther along the
 fence; maybe the horses are down there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valeria did not reply, but stood very straight and dignified in the shadow
 of the huge pile of rotting railroad ties. He was gone but a moment, and
 came anxiously back to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're not here," he said, in a low voice. "Don't worry, dear. He'll
 come?I know Kent Burnett."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you sure?" queried Val sweetly. "From what I have seen of the
 gentleman, your high estimate of him seems quite unauthorized. Aside from
 escorting me to the hotel, he has been anything but reliable. Instead of
 telling you that I was here, or telling me that you were sick, he went
 straight into a saloon and forgot all about us both. You know that. If he
 were your friend, why should he immediately begin carousing, instead of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He didn't," Fleetwood defended weakly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No? Then perhaps you can explain his behavior. Why didn't he tell me you
 were sick? Why didn't he tell you I came on that train? Can you tell me
 that, Manley?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, for a very good reason, could not; so he put his arms around her
 and tried to coax her into good humor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sweetheart, let's not quarrel so soon?why, we're only two hours
 married! I want you to be happy, and if you'll only be brave and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Brave!" Mrs. Fleetwood laughed rather contemptuously, for a bride.
 "Please to understand, Manley, that I'm not frightened in the least. It's
 you and that horrid cowboy?<i>I</i> don't see why we need run away,
 like criminals. Those men don't intend to <i>murder</i> us, do they?" Her
 mood softened a little, and she squeezed his arm between her hands. "You
 dear old silly, I'm not blaming <i>you</i>. With your head in such a
 state, you can't think things out properly, and you let that cowboy
 influence you against your better judgment. You're afraid I might be
 annoyed?but, really, Manley, this silly idea of running away annoys
 me much more than all the noise those fellows could possibly make. Indeed,
 I don't think I would mind?it would give me a glimpse of the real
 West; and, perhaps, if they grew too boisterous, and I spoke to them and
 asked them not to be quite so rough?and, really, they only mean it
 as a sort of welcome, in their crude way. We could invite some of the
 nicest in to have cake and coffee?or maybe we might get some ice
 cream somewhere?and it might turn out a very pleasant little affair.
 I don't mind meeting them, Manley. The worst of them can't be as bad as
 that?but, of course, if he's your friend, I suppose I oughtn't to
 speak too freely my opinion of him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood held her closely, patted her cheek absently, and tried to think
 of some effective argument.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll be drunk, sweetheart," he told her, after a silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think so," she returned firmly. "I have been watching the street
 all the evening. I saw any number of men passing back and forth, and I
 didn't see one who staggered. And they were all very quiet, considering
 their rough ways, which one must expect. Why, Manley, you always wrote
 about these Western men being such fine fellows, and so generous and
 big-hearted, under their rough exterior. Your letters were full of it?and
 how chivalrous they all are toward nice women."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laid her head coaxingly against his shoulder. "Let's go back, Manley.
 I?<i>want</i> to see a <i>charivari</i>, dear. It will be fun. I
 want to write all about it to the girls. They'll be perfectly wild with
 envy." She struggled with her conventional upbringing. "And even if some
 of them are slightly under the influence?of liquor, we needn't <i>meet</i>
 them. You needn't introduce those at all, and I'm sure they will
 understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be silly, Val!" Fleetwood did not mean to be rude, but a faint
 glimmer of her romantic viewpoint?a viewpoint gained chiefly from
 current fiction and the stage?came to him and contrasted rather
 brutally with the reality. He did not know how to make her understand,
 without incriminating himself. His letters had been rather idealistic, he
 admitted to himself. They had been written unthinkingly, because he wanted
 her to like this big land; naturally he had not been too baldly truthful
 in picturing the place and the people. He had passed lightly over their
 faults and thrown the limelight on their virtues; and so he had aided
 unwittingly the stage and the fiction she had read, in giving her a false
 impression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Offended at his words and his tone, she drew away from him and glanced
 wistfully back toward the town, as if she meditated a haughty return to
 the hotel. She ended by seating herself upon a projecting tie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well, my lord," she retorted, "I shall try and not be silly, but
 merely idiotic, as you would have me. You and your friend!" She was very
 angry, but she was perfectly well-bred, she hoped. "If I might venture a
 word," she began again ironically, "it seems to me that your friend has
 been playing a practical joke upon you. He evidently has no intention of
 bringing any fleet steeds to us. No doubt he is at this moment laughing
 with his dissolute companions, because we are sitting out here in the dark
 like two silly chickens!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think he's coming now," Manley said rather stiffly. "Of course, I don't
 ask you to like him; but he's putting himself to a good deal of trouble
 for us, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wasted effort, so far as I am concerned," Valeria put in, with a chirpy
 accent which was exasperating, even to a bridegroom very much in love with
 his bride.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the darkness that muffled the land, save where the yellow flare of
 lamps in the little town made a misty brightness, came the click of shod
 hoofs. Another moment and a man, mounted upon a white horse, loomed
 indistinct before them, seeming to take substance from the night. Behind
 him trailed another horse, and for the first time in her life Valeria
 heard the soft, whispering creak of saddle leather, the faint clank of
 spur chains, and the whir of a horse mouthing the "cricket" in his bit.
 Even in her anger, she was conscious of an answering tingle of blood,
 because this was life in the raw?life such as she had dreamed of in
 the tight swaddlings of a smug civilization, and had longed for intensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent swung down close beside them, his form indistinct but purposeful.
 "I'm late, I guess," he remarked, turning to Fleetwood. "Fred got next,
 somehow, and?I was detained."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is he?" asked Manley, going up and laying a questioning hand upon
 the horse, by that means fully recognizing it as Kent's own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the oats box," said Kent laconically. He turned to the girl. "I
 couldn't get the sidesaddle," he explained apologetically. "I looked where
 Mrs. Hawley said it was, but I couldn't find it?and I didn't have
 much time. You'll have to ride a stock saddle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valeria drew back a step. "You mean?a man's saddle?" Her voice was
 carefully polite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, yes." And he added: "The horse is dead gentle?and a
 sidesaddle's no good, anyhow. You'll like this better." He spoke, as was
 evident, purely from a man's viewpoint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That viewpoint Mrs. Fleetwood refused to share. "Oh, I couldn't ride a
 man's saddle," she protested, still politely, and one could imagine how
 her lips were pursed. "Indeed, I'm not sure that I care to leave town at
 all." To her the declaration did not seem unreasonable or abrupt but she
 felt that Kent was very much shocked. She saw him turn his head and look
 back toward the town, as if he half expected a pursuit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't reckon the oats box will hold Fred very long," he observed
 meditatively. He added reminiscently to Manley: "I had a deuce of a time
 getting the cover down and fastened."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm very sorry," said Valeria, with sweet dignity, "that you gave
 yourself so much trouble?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm kinda sorry myself," Kent agreed mildly, and Valeria blushed hotly,
 and was glad he could not see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, Val?you can ride this saddle, all right. All the girls out
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did not come West to imitate all the girls. Indeed, I could never think
 of such a thing. I couldn't possibly?really, Manley! And, you know,
 it does seem so childish of us to run away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent moved restlessly, and felt to see if the cinch was tight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fleetwood took her coaxingly by the arm. "Come, sweetheart, don't be
 stubborn. You know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, really! If it's a question of obstinacy?You see, I look at
 the matter in this way: You believe that you are doing what is best for my
 sake; I don't agree with you?and it does seem as if I should be
 permitted to judge what I desire." Then her dignity and her sweet calm
 went down before a flash of real, unpolished temper. "You two can take
 those nasty horses and ride clear to Dakota, if you want to. I'm going
 back to the hotel. And I'm going to tell somebody to let that poor fellow
 out of that box. I think you're acting perfectly horrid, both of you, when
 I don't want to go!" She actually started back toward the scattered points
 of light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not, however, get so faraway that she failed to hear Kent's "Well,
 I'll be damned!" uttered in a tone of intense disgust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't care," she assured herself, because of the thrill of compunction
 caused by that one forcible sentence. She had never before in her life
 heard a man really swear. It affected her very much as would the
 accidental touch of an electric battery. She walked on slowly, stumbling a
 little and trying to hear what it was they were saying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Kent passed her, loping back to the town, the led horse shaking his
 saddle so that it rattled the stirrups like castanets as he galloped. "I
 don't care," she told herself again very emphatically, because she was
 quite sure that she did care?or that she would care if only she
 permitted herself to be so foolish. Manley overtook her then, and drew her
 hand under his arm to lead her. But he seemed quite sullen, and would not
 say a word all the way back.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV. THE "SHIVAREE"
 </h2>
 <p>
 Kent jerked open the stable door, led in his horses, turned them into
 their stalls, and removed the saddles with quick, nervous movements which
 told plainly how angry he was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll get myself all excited trying to do her a favor again?I don't
 think!" he growled in the ear of Michael, his gray gelding. "Think of me
 getting let down on my face like that! By a woman!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He felt along the wall in the intense darkness until his fingers touched a
 lantern, took it down from the nail where it hung, and lighted it. He
 carried it farther down the rude passage between the stalls, hung it high
 upon another nail, and turned to the great oats box, from within which
 came a vigorous thumping and the sound of muttered cursing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent was not in the mood to see the humor of anything in particular. Had
 he known anything about Pandora's box he might have drawn a comparison
 very neatly while he stood scowling down at the oats box, for certainly he
 was likely to release trouble in plenty when he unfastened that lid. He
 felt of the gun swinging at his hip, just to assure himself that it was
 there and ready for business in case Fred wanted to shoot, and rapped with
 his knuckles upon the box, producing instant silence within.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't make so much noise in there," he advised grimly, "not unless you
 want the whole town to know where you are, and have 'em give you the
 laugh. And, listen here: I ain't apologizing for what I done, but, all the
 same, I'm sorry I did it. It wasn't any use. I'd rather be shut up in an
 oats box all night than get let down like I was?and I'm telling you
 this so as to start us off even. If you want to fight about it when you
 come out, all right; you're the doctor. But I'm just as sorry as you are
 it happened. I lay down my hand right here. I hope you shivaree Man and
 his wife?and shivaree 'em good. I hope you bust the town wide open."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why this sudden change of heart?" came muffled from within.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah?that's my own business. Well, I don't like you a little bit, and
 you know it; but I'll tell you, just to give you a fair show. I wanted to
 keep Man sober, and I tried to get him and his wife out of town before
 that shivaree of yours was pulled off. But the lady wouldn't have it that
 way. I got let right down on my face, and I'm done. Now you know just
 where I stand. Maybe I'm a fool for telling you, but I seem to be in the
 business to-night. Come on out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He unfastened the big iron hasp, which was showing signs of the strain put
 upon it, and stepped back watchfully. The thick, oaken lid was pushed up,
 and Fred De Garmo, rather dusty and disheveled and purple from the close
 atmosphere of the box and from anger as well, came up like a
 jack-in-the-box and glared at Kent. When he had stepped out upon the
 stable floor, however, he smiled rather unpleasantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 {Illustration: He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his crowd}
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you've told the truth," he said maliciously, "I guess the lady has
 pretty near evened things up. If you haven't?if I don't find them
 both at the hotel?well?Anyway," he added, with an ominous
 inflection, "there'll be other days to settle this in!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, sure. Help yourself, Fred," Kent retorted cheerfully, and stood
 where he was until Fred had gone out. Then he turned and closed the box.
 "Between that yellow-eyed dame and the chump that went and left this box
 wide open for me to tip Fred into," he soliloquized, while he took down
 the lantern, and so sent the shadows dancing weirdly about him, "I've got
 a bunch of trouble mixed up, for fair. I wish the son of a gun would fight
 it out now, and be done with it; but no, that ain't Fred. He'd a heap
 rather wait and let it draw interest!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Over in the hotel the "yellow-eyed dame" was doing her unsophisticated
 best to meet the situation gracefully, and to realize certain vague and
 rather romantic dreams of her life out West. She meant to be very
 gracious, for one thing, and to win the chivalrous friendship of every man
 who came to participate in the rude congratulations that had been planned.
 Just how she meant to do this she did not know?except that the
 graciousness would certainly prove a very important factor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to remain downstairs," she told Manley, when they reached the
 hotel. It was the first sentence she had spoken since he overtook her.
 "I'm so glad, dear," she added diplomatically, "that you decided to stay.
 I want to see that funny landlady now, please, and get her to serve coffee
 and cake to our guests in the parlor. I wish I might have had one of my
 trunks brought over here; I should like to wear a pretty gown." She
 glanced down at her tailored suit with true feminine dissatisfaction. "But
 everything was so?so confused, with your being late, and sick?is
 your head better, dear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, in very few words, assured her that it was. Manley was struggling
 with his inner self, trying to answer one very important question, and to
 answer it truthfully: Could he meet "the boys," do his part among them,
 and still remain sober? That seemed to be the only course open to him now,
 and he knew himself just well enough to doubt his own strength. But if
 Kent would help him?He felt an immediate necessity to find Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll find Mrs. Hawley somewhere around," he said hurriedly. "I've got
 to see Kent?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Manley! Don't have anything to do with that horrid cowboy! He's not?nice.
 He?he swore, when he must have known I could hear him; and he was
 swearing about <i>me</i>, Manley. Didn't you hear him?" She stood in the
 doorway and clung to his arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," lied Manley. "You must have been mistaken, sweetheart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I wasn't; I heard him quite plainly." She must have thought it a
 terrible thing, for she almost whispered the last words, and she released
 him with much reluctance. It seemed to her that Manley was in danger of
 falling among low associates, and that she must protect him in spite of
 himself. It failed to occur to her that Manley had been exposed to that
 danger for three years, without any protection whatever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was thankful, when he came to her later in the parlor, to learn from
 him that he had not held any speech with Kent. That was some comfort?and
 she felt that she needed a little comforting, just then. Her consultation
 with Arline had been rather unsatisfactory. Arline had told her bluntly
 that "the bunch" didn't want any coffee and cake. Whisky and cigars, said
 Arline, without so much as a blush, was what appealed to them fellows. If
 Manley handed it out liberal enough, they wouldn't bother his bride. Very
 likely, Arline had assured her, she wouldn't see one of them. That, on the
 whole, had been rather discouraging. How was she to show herself a
 gracious lady, forsooth, if no one came near her? But she kept these
 things jealously tucked away in the remotest corner of her own mind, and
 managed to look the relief she did not feel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, after all, the <i>charivari</i>, as is apt to be the case when the
 plans are laid so carefully, proved a very tame affair. Valeria, sitting
 rather dismally in the parlor with Mrs. Hawley for company, at midnight
 heard a banging of tin cans somewhere outside, a fitful popping of
 six-shooters, and an abortive attempt at a procession coming up the
 street. But the lines seemed to waver and then break utterly at the first
 saloon, where drink was to be had for the asking and Manley Fleetwood was
 pledged to pay, and the rattle of cans was all but drowned in the shouts
 of laughter and talk which came from the "office," across the hall. For
 where is the pleasure or the profit in <i>charivaring</i> a bridal couple
 which stays up and waits quite openly for the clamor?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it always so noisy here at night?" asked Valeria faintly when Mrs.
 Hawley had insisted upon her lying down upon the uncomfortable sofa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, no?unless a round-up pulls in, or there's a dance, or it's
 Christmas, or something. It's liable to keep up till two or three o'clock,
 so the sooner you git used to it, the better off you'll be. I'm going to
 leave you here, and go to bed?unless you want to go upstairs
 yourself. Only it'll be noisier than ever up in your room, for it's right
 over the office, and the way sound travels up is something fierce. Don't
 you be afraid?I'll lock this door, and if your husband wants to come
 in he can come through the dining room." She looked at Valeria and
 hesitated before she spoke the next sentence. "And don't you worry a bit
 over him, neither. My old man was in the kitchen a minute ago, when I was
 out there, and he says Man ain't drinking a drop to-night. He's keeping as
 straight as?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valeria sat up suddenly, quite scandalized. "Oh?why, of course
 Manley wouldn't drink with them! Why?who ever heard of such a thing?
 The idea!" She stared reproachfully at her hostess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, sure! I didn't say such a thing was liable to happen. I just thought
 you might be?worrying?they're making so much racket in there,"
 stammered Arline.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed, no. I'm not at all worried, thank you. And please don't let me
 keep you up any longer, Mrs. Hawley. I am quite comfortable?mentally
 and physically, I assure you. Good night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not even Mrs. Hawley could remain after that. She went out and closed the
 door carefully behind her, without even finding voice enough to return
 Valeria's sweetly modulated good night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's got a whole lot to learn," she relieved her feelings somewhat by
 muttering as she mounted the stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What it cost Manley Fleetwood to abstain absolutely and without even the
 compromise of "soft" drinks that night, who can say? Three years of free
 living in Montana had lowered his standard of morality without giving him
 that rugged strength of mind which makes a man master of himself first of
 all. He had that day lain, drunken and sleeping, when he should have been
 at his mental and physical best to meet the girl who would marry him. It
 was that very defection, perhaps, which kept him sober in the midst of his
 taunting fellows. Now that Valeria was actually here, and was his wife, he
 was possessed by the desire to make some sacrifice by which he might prove
 his penitence. At any cost he would spare her pain and humiliation, he
 told himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did it, and he did it under difficulty. He was denied the moral support
 of Kent Burnett, for Kent was sulking over his slight, and would have
 nothing to say to him. He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his
 crowd. He was "baptized" by some drunken reveler, so that the stench of
 spilled whisky filled his nostrils and tortured him the night through. He
 was urged, he was bullied, he was ridiculed. His head throbbed, his
 eyeballs burned. But through it all he stayed among them because he feared
 that if he left them and went to Val, some drunken fool might follow him
 and shock her with his inebriety. He stayed, and he stayed sober. Val was
 his wife. She trusted him, and she was ignorant of his sins. If he went to
 her staggering and babbling incoherent foolishness, he knew it would break
 her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the sky was at last showing faint dawn tints and the clamor had worn
 itself out perforce?because even the leaders were, after all, but
 men, and there was a limit to their endurance?Manley entered the
 parlor, haggard enough, it is true, and bearing with him the stale odor of
 cigars long since smoked, and of the baptism of bad whisky, but also with
 the air of conscious rectitude which sits so comically upon a man unused
 to the feeling of virtue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As is so often the case when one fights alone the good fight and manages
 to win, he was chagrined to find himself immediately put upon the
 defensive. Val, as she speedily demonstrated, declined to look upon him as
 a hero, or as being particularly virtuous. She considered herself rather
 neglected and abused. She believed that he had stayed away because he was
 angry with her on account of her refusal to leave town, and she thought
 that was rather brutal of him. Also, her head ached from tears and lack of
 sleep, and she hated the town, the hotel?almost she hated Manley
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley felt the rebuff of her chilling silence when he came in, and when
 she twitched herself loose from his embrace he came near regretting his
 extreme virtue. He spent ten minutes trying to explain, without telling
 all of the truth, and he felt his good opinion of himself slipping from
 him before her inexorable disfavor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't blame you for not liking the town, Val," he said at last,
 rather desperately. "But you mustn't judge the whole country by it. You'll
 like the ranch, dear. You'll feel as if you were in another world?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope so," Val interrupted quellingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll drive out there just as soon as we have breakfast." He laid his
 hand diffidently upon her tumbled hair. "I <i>had</i> to stay out there
 with those fellows. I didn't want to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want any breakfast," said Val, getting up and going over to the
 window?it would seem to avoid his caress. "The odor of that dining
 room is enough to make one fast forever." She lifted the grimy lace
 curtain with her finger tips and looked disconsolately out upon the
 street. "It's just a dirty, squalid little hamlet. I don't suppose the
 streets have been cleaned or the garbage removed from the back yards since
 the place was first?founded." She laughed shortly at the idea of
 "founding" a wretched village like that, but she had no other word at
 hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Arline</i>," she remarked, in a tone of drawling recklessness. "Arline
 swears. Did you know it? I suppose, of course, you do. She said something
 that struck me as being shockingly true. She said I'm 'sure having a hell
 of a honeymoon.'" Then she bit her lips hard, because her eyelids were
 stinging with the tears she refused to shed in his presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Val!" From the sofa Manley stared contritely at her back. She must
 feel terrible, he thought, to bring herself to repeat that sentence?Val,
 so icily pure in her thoughts and her speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was blinking her tawny eyes?like the eyes of a lion in color?at
 the street. Not for the world would she let him see that she wanted to
 cry! A figure, blurred to indistinctness, appealed in a doorway nearly
 opposite, stood for a moment looking up at the reddened sky, and came
 across the street. As the tears were beaten back she saw and recognized
 him, with a curl of the lip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here comes your cowboy friend?from a saloon, of course." Her voice
 was lazily contemptuous. "Only his presence in the street was needed to
 complete the picture of desolation. He has been in a fight, judging from
 his face. It is all bruised and skinned, and one eye is swollen?ugh!
 My guide, my adviser?is it possible, Manley, that you couldn't find
 a <i>nice</i> man to meet me at the train?" She turned from the
 disagreeable sight of Kent and faced her husband. "Are all the men like
 that? And are all the women like?Arline?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley looked at her dumbly from the sofa. Would Val ever come to
 understand the place, and the people, he was wondering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed suddenly. "I'm beginning to feel very sorry for Walt," she
 said irrelevantly, pointing to the easel and the expressionless crayon
 portrait staring out from the gilt frame. "He has to stay in this room
 always. And I believe another two hours would drive me hopelessly insane."
 The word caught her attention. "Hope!" she laughed ironically. "What
 imbecile ever thought of hope in the same breath with this place? What
 they really ought to do is paint that 'Abandon-hope' admonition across the
 whole front of the depot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, because he had lifted his head too suddenly and so sent white-hot
 irons of pain clashing through his brain, turned sullen. "If you hate it
 as bad as all that," he said, "why, there'll be a train for the East in
 about two hours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stiffened perceptibly, though the petulance in her face changed to
 something wistful. "Do you mean?do you want me to go?" she asked
 very calmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley pressed his fingers hard against his temples. "You know I don't. I
 want you to stay and like the country, and be happy. But?the way you
 have been talking makes it seem?a-ah!" He dropped his tortured head
 upon his hands and did not trouble to finish what he had intended to say.
 Nervous strain, lack of sleep, and a headache to begin with, were taking
 heavy toll of him. He could not argue with her; he could not do anything
 except wish he were dead, or that his head would stop aching.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val took one of her unexpected changes of mood. She went up and laid her
 cold fingers lightly upon his temples, where she could see the blood
 beating savagely in the swollen veins. "What a little beast I am!" she
 murmured contritely. "Shall I get you some coffee, dear? Or some headache
 tablets, or?You know a cold cloth helped you last evening. Lie down
 for a little while. There's no hurry about starting, is there? I?I
 don't hate the place so awfully, Manley. I'm just cross because I couldn't
 sleep for the noise. Here's a cushion, dear. I think it's stuffed with
 scrap iron, for there doesn't seem to be anything soft about it except the
 invitation to 'slumber sweetly,' in red and green silk; but anything is
 better than the head of that sofa in its natural state."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She arranged the cushion to her own liking, if not to his, and when it was
 done she bent down impulsively and kissed him on the cheek, blushing
 vividly the while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't be nasty and cross any more," she promised. "Now, I'm going to
 interview Arline. I hear dishes rattling somewhere; perhaps I can get a
 cup of real coffee for you." At the door she shook her finger at him
 playfully. "Don't you dare stir off that sofa while I'm gone," she
 admonished. "And, remember, we're not going to leave town until your head
 stops aching?not if we stay here a week!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She insisted upon bringing him coffee and toast upon a tray?a
 battered old tray, purloined for that purpose from the saloon, if she had
 only known it?and she informed him, with a pretty, domestic pride,
 that she had made the toast herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Arline was going to lay slices of bread on top of the stove," she
 explained. "She said she always makes toast that way, and no one could
 tell the difference! I never heard of such a thing?did you, Manley?
 But I've been attending a cooking school ever since you left Fern Hill. I
 didn't tell you?I wanted it for a surprise. I could have done better
 with the toast before a wood fire?I think poor Arline was nearly
 distracted at the way I poked coals down from the grate; but she didn't
 say anything. Isn't it funny, to have cream in cans! I don't suppose it
 ever saw a cow?do you? The coffee's pretty bad, isn't it? But wait
 until we get home! I can make lovely coffee?if you'll get me a
 percolator. You will, won't you? And I learned now to make the most
 delicious fruit salad, just before I left. A cousin of Mrs. Forman's
 taught me how. Could you drink another cup, dear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley could not, and she deplored the poor quality, although she
 generously absolved Arline from blame, because there seemed so much to do
 in that kitchen. She refused to take any breakfast herself, telling him
 gayly that the odor in the kitchen was both food and drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Because he understood a little of her loathing for the place, Manley lied
 heroically about his headache, so that within an hour they were leaving
 town, with the two great trunks roped securely to the buckboard behind the
 seat, and with Val's suitcase placed flat in the front, where she could
 rest her feet upon it. Val was so happy at the prospect of getting away
 from the town that she actually threw a kiss in the direction of Arline,
 standing with her frowsy head, her dough-spotted apron, and her tired face
 in the parlor door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her mood changed immediately, however, for she had no more than turned
 from waving her hand at Arline, when they met Kent, riding slowly up the
 street with his hat tilted over the eye most swollen. Without a doubt he
 had seen her waving and smiling, and so he must have observed the instant
 cooling of her manner. He nodded to Manley and lifted his hat while he
 looked at her full; and Val, in the arrogant pride of virtuous young
 womanhood, let her golden-brown eyes dwell impersonally upon his face; let
 her white, round chin dip half an inch downward, and then looked past him
 as if he were a post by the roadside. Afterwards she smiled maliciously
 when she saw, with a swift, sidelong glance, how he scowled and spurred
 unnecessarily his gray gelding.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V. COLD SPRING RANCH
 </h2>
 <p>
 For almost three years the letters from Manley had been headed "Cold
 Spring Ranch." For quite as long Val had possessed a mental picture of the
 place?a picture of a gurgly little brook with rocks and watercress
 and distracting little pools the size of a bathtub, and with a great,
 frowning boulder?a cliff, almost?at the head. The brook
 bubbled out and formed a basin in the shadow of the rock. Around it grew
 trees, unnamed in the picture, it is true, but trees, nevertheless. Below
 the spring stood a picturesque little cottage. A shack, Manley had
 written, was but a synonym for a small cottage, and Val had many small
 cottages in mind, from which she sketched one into her picture. The sun
 shone on it, and the western breezes flapped white curtains in the
 windows, and there was a porch where she would swing her hammock and gaze
 out over the great, beautiful country, fascinating in its very immensity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somewhere beyond the cottage?"shack," she usually corrected herself?were
 the corrals; they were as yet rather impressionistic; high, round,
 mysterious inclosures forming an effective, if somewhat hazy, background
 to the picture. She left them to work out their attractive details upon
 closer acquaintance, for at most they were merely the background. The
 front yard, however, she dwelt upon, and made aglow with sturdy,
 bright-hued flowers. Manley had that spring planted sweet peas, and
 poppies, and pansies, and other things, he wrote her, and they had come up
 very nicely. Afterward, in a postscript, he answered her oft-repeated
 questions about the flower garden:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The flowers aren't doing as well as they might. They need your tender
 care. I don't have much time to pet them along. The onions are doing
 pretty well, but they need weeding badly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In spite of that, the flowers bloomed luxuriantly in her mental picture,
 though she conscientiously remembered that they weren't doing as well as
 they might. They were weedy and unkempt, she supposed, but a little time
 and care would remedy that; and was she not coming to be the mistress of
 all this, and to make everything beautiful? Besides, the spring, and the
 brook which ran from it, and the trees which shaded it, were the chief
 attractions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps she betrayed a lack of domesticity because she had not been able
 to "see" the interior of the cottage?"shack"?very clearly.
 Sunny rooms, white curtains, bright cushions and books, pictures and rugs
 mingled together rather confusingly in her mind when she dwelt upon the
 inside of her future home. It would be bright, and cozy, and "homy," she
 knew. She would love it because it would be hers and Manley's, and she
 could do with it what she would. She bothered about that no more than she
 did about the dresses she would be wearing next year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cold Spring Ranch! Think of the allurement of that name, just as it
 stands, without any disconcerting qualification whatever! Any girl with
 yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, and a dreamy temperament
 that beautifies everything her imagination touches, would be sure to build
 a veritable Eve's garden around those three small words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that picture still before her mental vision, clear as if she had all
 her life been familiar with it in reality, she rode beside Manley for
 three weary hours, across a wide, wide prairie which looked perfectly
 level when you viewed it as a whole, but which proved all hills and
 hollows when you drove over it. During those three hours they passed not
 one human habitation after the first five miles were behind them. There
 had been a ranch, back there against a reddish-yellow bluff. Val had gazed
 upon it, and then turned her head away, distressed because human beings
 could consent to live in such unattractive surroundings. It was bad in its
 way as Hope, she thought, but did not say, because Manley was talking
 about his cattle, and she did not want to interrupt him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After that there had been no houses of any sort. There was a barbed-wire
 fence stretching away and away until the posts were mere pencil lines
 against the blue, where the fence dipped over the last hill before the sky
 bent down and kissed the earth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The length of that fence was appalling in a vague, wordless way, Val
 unconsciously drew closer to her husband when she looked at it, and
 shivered in spite of the midsummer heat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're getting tired." Manley put his arm around her and held her there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're over half-way now. A little longer and we'll be home." Then he
 bethought him that she might want some preparation for that home-coming.
 "You mustn't expect much, little wife. It's a bachelor's house, so far.
 You'll have to do some fixing before it will suit you. You don't look
 forward to anything like Fern Hill, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val laughed, and bent solicitously over the suitcase, which her feet had
 marred. "Of course I don't. Nothing out here is like Fern Hill. I know our
 ranch is different from anything I ever knew?but I know just how it
 will be, and how everything will look."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Do you?" Manley looked at her a bit anxiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For three years," Val reminded him, "you have been describing things to
 me. You told me what it was like when you first took the place. You
 described everything, from Cold Spring Coulee to the house you built, and
 the spring under the rock wall, and even the meadow lark's nest you found
 in the weeds. Of <i>course</i> I know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's going to seem pretty rough, at first," he observed rather
 apologetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but I shall not mind that. I want it to be rough. I'm tired to
 death of the smug smoothness of my life so far. Oh, if you only knew how I
 have hated Fern Hill, these last three years, especially since I
 graduated. Just the same petty little lives lived in the same petty little
 way, day in and day out. Every Sunday the class in Sunday school, and the
 bells ringing and the same little walk of four blocks there and back.
 Every Tuesday and Friday the club meeting?the Merry Maids, and the
 Mascot, both just alike, where you did the same things. And the same round
 of calls with mamma, on the same people, twice a month the year round. And
 the little social festivities?ah, Manley, if you only knew how I
 tong for something rough and real in my life!" It was very nearly what she
 said to the tired-faced teacher on the train.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if that's what you want, you've come to the right place," he told
 her dryly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later, when they drew close to a red coulee rim which he said was the far
 side of Cold Spring Coulee, she forgot how tired she was, and felt every
 nerve quiver with eagerness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later still, when in the glare of a July sun they drove around a low
 knoll, dipped into a wide, parched coulee, and then came upon a barren
 little habitation inclosed in a meager fence of the barbed wire she
 thought so detestable, she shut her eyes mentally to something she could
 not quite bring herself to face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lifted her out and tumbled the great trunks upon the ground before he
 drove on to the corrals. "Here's the key," he said, "if you want to go in.
 I won't be more than a minute or two." He did not look into her face when
 he spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stood just inside the gate and tried to adjust all this to her mental
 picture. There was the front yard, for instance. A few straggling vines
 against the porch, and a sickly cluster or two of blossoms?those
 were the sweet peas, surely. The sun-baked bed of pale-green plants
 without so much as a bud of promise, she recognized, after a second
 glance, as the poppies. For the rest, there were weeds against the fence,
 sun-ripened grass trodden flat, yellow, gravelly patches where nothing
 grew?and a glaring, burning sun beating down upon it all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cottage?never afterward did she think of it by that name, but
 always as a shack?was built of boards placed perpendicularly, with
 battens nailed over the cracks to keep out the wind and the snow. At one
 side was a "lean-to" kitchen, and on the other side was the porch that was
 just a narrow platform with a roof over it. It was not wide enough for a
 rocking-chair, to say nothing of swinging a hammock. In the first hasty
 inspection this seemed to be about all. She was still hesitating before
 the door when Manley came back from putting up the horses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid your flowers are a lost cause," he remarked cheerfully. "They
 were looking pretty good two or three weeks ago. This hot weather has
 dried them up. Next year we'll have water down here to the house. All
 these things take time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, of course they do." Val managed to smile into his eyes. "Let's see
 how many dishes you left dirty; bachelors always leave their dishes
 unwashed on the table, don't they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes?but I generally wash mine." He led the way into the
 house, which smelled hot and close, with the odor of food long since
 cooked and eaten, before he threw all the windows open. The front room was
 clean?after a man's idea of cleanliness. The floor was covered with
 an exceedingly dusty carpet, and a rug or two. Her latest photograph was
 nailed to the wall; and when Val saw it she broke into hysterical
 laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've nailed your colors to the mast," she cried, and after that it was
 all a joke. The home-made couch, with the calico cushions and the cowhide
 spread, was a matter for mirth. She sat down upon it to try it, and was
 informed that chicken wire makes a fine spring. The rickety table, with
 tobacco, magazines, and books placed upon it in orderly piles, was
 something to smile over. The chairs, and especially the one cane rocker
 which went sidewise over the floor if you rocked in it long enough, were
 pronounced original.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the kitchen the same masculine idea of cleanliness and order obtained.
 The stove was quite red, but it had been swept clean. The table was pushed
 against the only window there, and the back part was filled with glass
 preserve jars, cans, and a loaf of bread wrapped carefully in paper; but
 the oilcloth cover was clean?did it not show quite plainly the marks
 of the last washing? Two frying pans were turned bottom up on an obscure
 table in an obscure corner of the room, and a zinc water pail stood beside
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were other details which impressed themselves upon her shrinking
 brain, and though she still insisted upon smiling at everything, she stood
 in the middle of the room holding up her skirts quite unconsciously, as if
 she were standing at a muddy street crossing, wondering how in the world
 she was ever going to reach the Other side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Isn't it all?deliciously?primitive?" she asked, in a weak
 little voice, when the smile would stay no longer. "I?love it,
 dear." That was a lie; more, she was not in the habit of fibbing for the
 sake of politeness or anything else, so that the words stood for a good
 deal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley looked into the zinc water pail, took it up, and started for an
 outer door, rattling the tin dipper as he went. "Want to go up to the
 spring?" he queried, over his shoulder, "Water's the first thing?I'm
 horribly thirsty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val turned to follow him. "Oh, yes?the spring!" She stopped,
 however, as soon as she had spoken. "No, dear. There'll be plenty of other
 times. I'll stay here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave her a glance bright with love and blind happiness in her presence
 there, and went off whistling and rattling the pail at his side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val did not even watch him go. She stood still in the kitchen and looked
 at the table, and at the stove, and at the upturned frying pans. She
 watched two great horseflies buzzing against a window-pane, and when she
 could endure that no longer, she went into the front room and stared
 vacantly around at the bare walls. When she saw her picture again, nailed
 fast beside the kitchen door, her face lost a little of its frozen
 blankness?enough so that her lips quivered until she bit them into
 steadiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went then to the door and stood looking dully out into the parched
 yard, and at the wizened little pea vines clutching feebly at their
 white-twine trellis. Beyond stretched the bare hills with the wavering
 brown line running down the nearest one?the line that she knew was
 the trail from town. She was guilty of just one rebellious sentence before
 she struggled back to optimism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I said I wanted it to be rough, but I didn't mean?why, this is just
 squalid!" She looked down the coulee and glimpsed the river flowing calmly
 past the mouth of it, a majestic blue belt fringed sparsely with green. It
 must be a mile away, but it relieved wonderfully the monotony of brown
 hills, and the vivid coloring brightened her eyes. She heard Manley enter
 the kitchen, set down the pail of water, and come on to where she stood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd forgotten you said we could see the river from here," she told him,
 smiling over her shoulder. "It's beautiful, isn't it? I don't suppose,
 though, there's a boat within millions of miles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, there's a boat down there. It leaks, though. I just use it for ducks,
 close to shore. Admiring our view? Great, don't you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val clasped her hands before her and let her gaze travel again over the
 sweep of rugged hills. "It's?wonderful. I thought I knew, but I see
 I didn't. I feel very small, Manley; does one ever grow up to it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He seemed dimly to catch the note of utter desolation. "You'll get used to
 all that," he assured her. "I thought I'd reached the jumping-off place,
 at first. But now?you couldn't dog me outa the country."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was slipping into the vernacular, and Val noticed it, and wondered
 dully if she would ever do likewise. She had not yet admitted to herself
 that Manley was different. She had told herself many times that it would
 take weeks to wipe out the strangeness born of three years' separation. He
 was the same, of course; everything else was new and?different. That
 was all. He seemed intensely practical, and he seemed to feel that his
 love-making had all been done by letter, and that nothing now remained
 save the business of living. So, when he told her to rest, and that he
 would get dinner and show her how a bachelor kept house, she let him go
 with no reply save that vague, impersonal smile which Kent had encountered
 at the depot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While he rattled things about in the kitchen, she stood still in the
 doorway with her fingers doubled into tight little fists, and stared out
 over the great, treeless, unpeopled land which had swallowed her alive.
 She tried to think?and then, in another moment, she was trying not
 to think.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Glancing quickly over her shoulder, to make sure Manley was too busy to
 follow her, she went off the porch and stood uncertain in the parched
 inclosure which was the front yard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I may as well see it all, and be done," she whispered, and went
 stealthily around the corner of the house, holding up her skirts as she
 had done in the kitchen. There was a dim path beaten in the wiry grass?a
 path which started at the kitchen door and wound away up the coulee. She
 followed it. Undoubtedly it would lead her to the spring; beyond that she
 refused to let her thoughts travel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In five minutes?for she went slowly?she stopped beside a
 stock-trampled pool of water and yellow mud. A few steps farther on, a
 barrel had been sunk in the ground at the base of a huge gray rock; a
 barrel which filled slowly and spilled the overflow into the mud. There
 was also a trough, and there was a barrier made of poles and barbed wire
 to keep the cattle from the barrel. One crawled between two wires, it
 would seem, to dip up water for the house. There were no trees?not
 real trees. There were some chokecherry bushes higher than her head, and
 there were other bushes that did not look particularly enlivening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With a smile of bitter amusement, she tucked her skirts tightly around
 her, crept through the fence, and filled a chipped granite cup which stood
 upon a rock ledge, and drank slowly. Then she laughed aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The water really <i>is</i> cold," she said. "Anywhere else it would be
 delicious. And that's a spring, I suppose." Mercilessly she was stripping
 her mind of her illusions, and was clothing it in the harsher weave of
 reality. "All these hills are Manley's?our ranch." She took another
 sip and set down the cup. "And so Cold Spring Ranch means?all this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down the coulee she heard Manley call. She stood still, pushing back a
 fallen lock of fine, yellow hair. She turned toward the sound, and the sun
 in her eyes turned them yellow as the hair above them. She was beautiful,
 in an odd, white-and-gold way. If her eyes had been blue, or gray?or
 even brown?she would have been merely pretty; but as they were, that
 amber tint where one looked for something else struck one unexpectedly and
 made her whole face unforgettably lovely. However, the color of her eyes
 and her hair did not interest her then, or make life any easier. She was
 quite ordinarily miserable and homesick, as she went reluctantly back
 along the grassy trails The odor of fried bacon came up to her, and she
 hated bacon. She hated everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been to the spring," she called out, resolutely cheerful, as soon as
 she came in sight of Manley, waiting in the kitchen door; she ran toward
 him lightly. "However does the water keep so deliciously cool through this
 hot weather? I don't wonder you call this Cold Spring Ranch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley straightened proudly. "I'm glad you like it; I was afraid you might
 not, just at first. But you're the right stuff?I might have known
 it. Not every woman could come out here and appreciate this country right
 at the start."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stopped at the steps, panting a little from her run, and smiled
 unflinchingly up into his face.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI. MANLEY'S FIRE GUARD
 </h2>
 <p>
 Hot sunlight, winds as hot, a shimmering heat which distorted objects at a
 distance and made the sky line a dazzling, wavering ribbon of faded blue;
 and then the dull haze of smoke which hung over the land, and, without
 tempering the heat, turned the sun into a huge coppery balloon, which
 drifted imperceptibly from the east to the west, and at evening time
 settled softly down upon a parched hilltop and disappeared, leaving behind
 it an ominous red glow as of hidden fires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the wind blew, the touch of it seared the face, as the smoke tang
 assailed the nostrils. All the world was a weird, unnatural tint, hard to
 name, never to be forgotten. The far horizons drew steadily closer as the
 days passed slowly and thickened the veil of smoke. The distant mountains
 drew daily back into dimmer distance; became an obscure, formless blot
 against the sky, and vanished completely. The horizon crouched then upon
 the bluffs across the river, moved up to the line of trees along its
 banks, blotted them out one day, and impudently established itself
 half-way up the coulee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Time ceased to be measured accurately; events moved slowly in an unreal
 world of sultry heat and smoke and a red sun wading heavily through the
 copper-brown sky from the east to the west, and a moon as red which
 followed meekly after.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Men rode uneasily here and there, and when they met they talked of prairie
 fires and of fire guards and the direction of the wind, and of the faint
 prospect of rain. Cattle, driven from their accustomed feeding grounds,
 wandered aimlessly over the still-unburned range, and lowed often in the
 night as they drifted before the flame-heated wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fifteen miles to the east of Cold Spring Coulee, the Wishbone outfit
 watched uneasily the deepening haze. Kent and Bob Royden were put to
 riding the range from the river north and west, and Polycarp Jenks, who
 had taken a claim where were good water and some shelter, and who never
 seemed to be there for more than a few hours at a time, because of his
 boundless curiosity, wandered about on his great, raw-boned sorrel with
 the white legs, and seemed always to have the latest fire news on the tip
 of his tongue, and always eager to impart it to somebody.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the northwest there was the Double Diamond, also sleeping with both
 eyes open, so to speak. They also had two men out watching the range,
 though the fires were said to be all across the river. But there was the
 railroad seaming the country straight through the grassland, and though
 the company was prompt at plowing fire guards, contract work would always
 bear watching, said the stockmen, and with the high winds that prevailed
 there was no telling what might happen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Fred De Garmo and Bill Madison patrolled the country in rather
 desultory fashion, if the truth be known. They liked best to ride to the
 north and east?which, while following faithfully the railroad and
 the danger line, would bring them eventually to Hope, where they never
 failed to stop as long as they dared. For, although they never analyzed
 their feelings, they knew that as long as they kept their jobs and their
 pay was forthcoming, a few miles of blackened range concerned them
 personally not at all. Still, barring a fondness for the trail which led
 to town, they were not unfaithful to their trust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day Kent and Polycarp met on the brink of a deep coulee, and, as is
 the way of men who ride the dim trails, they stopped to talk a bit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp, cracking his face across the middle with his habitual grin,
 straightened his right leg to its full length, slid his hand with
 difficulty into his pocket, brought up a dirty fragment of "plug" tobacco,
 looked it over inquiringly, and pried off the corner with his teeth. When
 he had rolled it comfortably into his cheek and had straightened his leg
 and replaced the tobacco in his pocket, he was "all set" and ready for
 conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent had taken the opportunity to roll a cigarette, though smoking on the
 range was a weakness to be indulged in with much care. He pinched out the
 blaze of his match, as usual, and then spat upon it for added safety
 before throwing it away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If this heat doesn't let up," he remarked, "the grass is going to blaze
 up from sunburn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It won't need to, if you ask me. I wouldn't be su'prised to see this hull
 range afire any time. Between you an' me, Kenneth, them Double Diamond
 fellers ain't watching it as close as they might. I was away over Dry
 Creek way yesterday, and I seen where there was two different fires got
 through the company's guards, and kited off across the country. It jest <i>happened</i>
 that the grass give out in that red day soil, and starved 'em both out.
 They wa'n't <i>put</i> out. I looked close all around, and there wasn't
 nary a track of man or horse. That's their business?ridin' line on
 the railroad. The section men's been workin' off down the other way, where
 a culvert got scorched up pretty bad. By granny, Fred 'n' Bill Madison
 spend might' nigh all their time ridin' the trail to town. They're might'
 p'ticular about watchin' the railroad between the switches?<i>he-he!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's something for the Double Diamond to worry over," Kent rebuffed. He
 hated that sort of gossip which must speak ill of somebody. "Our winter
 range lays mostly south and east; we could stop a fire between here and
 the Double Diamond, even if they let one get past 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp regarded him cunningly with his little, slitlike eyes. "Mebbe you
 could," he said doubtfully. "And then again, mebbe you couldn't. Oncet it
 got past Cold Spring?" He shook his wizened head slowly, leaned, and
 expectorated gravely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man Fleetwood's keeping tab pretty close over that way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp gave a grunt that was half a chuckle. "Man Fleetwood's keeping
 tab on what runs down his gullet," he corrected. "I seen him an' his wife
 out burnin' guards t' other day?over on his west line?and, by
 granny, it wouldn't stop nothing! A toad could jump it?<i>he-he!</i>"
 He sent another stream of tobacco juice afar, with the grave air as
 before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I told him so. 'Man,' I says, 'what you think you're doing?'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Buildin' a fire guard,' he says. 'My wife, Mr. Jenks.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Polycarp Jenks is my cognomen,' I says. 'And I don't want no misterin'
 in mine. Polycarp's good enough for me,' I says, and I took off my hat and
 bowed to 'is wife. Funny kinda eyes, she's got?ever take notice?
 Yeller, by granny! first time I ever seen yeller eyes in a human's face.
 Mebbe it was the sun in 'em, but they sure was yeller. I dunno as they
 hurt her looks none, either. Kinda queer lookin', but when you git used to
 'em you kinda like 'em.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'N' I says: 'Tain't half wide enough, nor a third'?spoke right up
 to 'im! I was thinkin' of the hull blamed country, and I didn't care how
 he took it. 'Any good, able-bodied wind'll jump a fire across that guard
 so quick it won't reelize there was any there,' I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man didn't like it none too well, either. He says to me: 'That guard'll
 stop any fire I ever saw,' and I got right back at him?<i>he-he!</i>
 'Man,' I says, 'you ain't never saw a prairie fire'?just like that.
 'You wait,' I says, 'till the real thing comes along. We ain't had any
 fires since you come into the country,' I says, 'and you don't know what
 they're like. Now, you take my advice and plow another four or five
 furrows?and plow 'em out, seventy-five or a hundred feet from here,'
 I says, 'an' make sure you git all the grass burned off between?and
 do it on a still day,' I says. 'You'll burn up the hull country if you
 keep on this here way you're doing,' I told him?straight out, just
 like that. 'And when you do it,' I says, 'you better let somebody know,
 so's they can come an' help,' I says. ''Tain't any job a man oughta tackle
 alone,' I says to him. 'Git help, Man, git help.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, by granny?<i>he-he!</i> Man's wife brustled up at me like a?a?"
 He searched his brain for a simile, and failed to find one. "'I have been
 helping Manley, Mr. Polycarp Jenks,' she says to me, 'and I flatter myself
 I have done as well as any <i>man</i> could do.' And, by granny! the way
 them yeller eyes of hern blazed at me?<i>he-he!</i> I had to laugh,
 jest to look at her. Dressed jest like a city girl, by granny! with
 ruffles on her skirts?to ketch afire if she wasn't mighty keerful!?and
 a big straw hat tied down with a veil, and kid gloves on her hands, and
 her yeller hair kinda fallin' around her face?and them yeller eyes
 snappin' like flames?by granny! if she didn't make as purty a
 picture as I ever want to set eyes on! Slim and straight, jest like a
 storybook woman?<i>he-he!</i> 'Course, she was all smoke an' dirt; a
 big flake of burned grass was on her hair, I took notice, and them ruffles
 was black up to her knees?<i>he-he!</i> And she had a big smut on
 her cheek?but she was right there with her stack of blues, by
 granny! Settin' into the game like a?a?" He leaned and spat
 "But burnin' guards ain't no work for a woman to do, an' I told Man so?straight
 out. 'You git help,' I says. 'I see you're might' near through with this
 here strip,' I says, 'an' I'm in a hurry, or I'd stay, right now.' And, by
 granny! if that there wife of Man's didn't up an' hit me another biff?<i>he-he!</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Thank you very much,' she says to me, like ice water. 'When we need your
 help, we'll be sure to let you know?but at present,' she says, 'we
 couldn't think of troubling you.' And then, by granny! she turns right
 around and smiles up at me?<i>he-he!</i> Made me feel like
 somebody'd tickled m' ear with a spear of hay when I was asleep, by
 granny! Never felt anything like it?not jest with somebody smilin'
 at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Polycarp Jenks,' she says to me, 'we do appreciate what you've told us,
 and I believe you're right,' she says. 'But don't insiniwate I'm not as
 good a fighter as any man who ever breathed,' she says. 'Manley has
 another of his headaches to-day?going to town always gives him a
 sick headache,' she says, 'and I've done nearly all of this my own, lone
 self,' she says. 'And I'm horribly proud of it, and I'll never forgive you
 for saying I?' And then, by granny! if she didn't begin to blink
 them eyes, and I felt like a?a?" He put the usual period to
 his hesitation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Between you an' <i>me</i>, Kenneth," he added, looking at Kent slyly,
 "she ain't having none too easy a time. Man's gone back to drinkin'?I
 knowed all the time he wouldn't stay braced up very long?lasted
 about six weeks, from all I c'n hear. Mebbe she reely thinks it's jest
 headaches ails him when he comes back from town?I dunno. You can't
 never tell what idees a woman's got tacked away under her hair?from
 all I c'n gether. I don't p'tend to know nothing about 'em?don't
 want to know?<i>he-he!</i> But I guess," he hinted cunningly, "I
 know as much about 'em as you do?hey, Kenneth? You don't seem to
 chase after 'em none, yourself?<i>he-he!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whereabouts did Man run his guards?" asked Kent, passing over the
 invitation to personal confessions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp gave a grunt of disdain. "Just on the west rim of his coulee.
 About forty rod of six-foot guard, and slanted so it'll shoot a fire right
 into high grass at the head of the coulee and send it kitin' over this
 way. That's supposin' it turns a fire, which it won't. Six feet?a
 fall like this here! Why, I never see grass so thick on this range?did
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder, did he burn that extra guard?" Kent was keeping himself rigidly
 to the subject of real importance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, by granny! he didn't?not unless he done it since yest'day. He
 went to town for suthin, and he might' nigh forgot to go home?<i>he-he!</i>
 He was there yest'day about three o'clock, an' I says to him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, so-long; I got to, be moving." Kent gathered up the reins and went
 his way, leaving Polycarp just in the act of drawing his "plug" from his
 pocket, by his usual laborious method, in mental preparation for another
 half hour of talk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you're ridin' over that way, Kenneth, you better take a look at Man's
 guard," he called after him. "A good mile of guard, along there, would
 help a lot if a fire got started beyond. The way he fixed it, it ain't no
 account at all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent proved by a gesture that he heard him, and rode on without turning to
 look back. Already his form was blurred as Polycarp gazed after him, and
 in another minute or two he was blotted out completely by the smoke veil,
 though he rode upon the level. Polycarp watched him craftily, though there
 was no need, until he was completely hidden, then he went on, ruminating
 upon the faults of his acquaintances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent had no intention of riding over to Cold Spring. He had not been there
 since Manley's marriage, though he had been a frequent visitor before, and
 unless necessity drove him there, it would be long before he faced again
 the antagonism of Mrs. Fleetwood. Still, he was mentally uncomfortable,
 and he felt much resentment against Polycarp Jenks because he had caused
 that discomfort. What was it to him, if Manley had gone bock to drinking?
 He asked the question more than once, and he answered always that it was
 nothing to him, of course. Still, he wished futilely that he had not been
 quite so eager to cover up Manley's weakness and deceive the girl. He
 ought to have given her a chance?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A cinder like a huge black snowflake struck him suddenly upon the cheek.
 He looked up, startled, and tried to see farther into the haze which
 closed him round. It seemed to him, now that his mind was turned from his
 musings, that the smoke was thicker, the smell of burning grass stronger,
 and the breath of wind hotter upon his face. He turned, looked away to the
 west, fancied there a tumbled blackness new to his sight, and put his
 horse to a run. If there were fire close, then every second counted; and
 as he raced over the uneven prairie he fumbled with the saddle string that
 held a sodden sack tied fast to the saddle, that he might lose no time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cinders grew thicker, until the air was filled with them, like a
 snowstorm done in India ink. A little farther and he heard a faint
 crackling; topped a ridge and saw not far ahead, a dancing, yellow line.
 His horse was breathing heavily with the pace he was keeping, but Kent,
 swinging away from the onrush of flame and heat, spurred him to a greater
 speed. They neared the end of the crackling, red line, and as Kent swung
 in behind it upon the burned ground, he saw several men beating steadily
 at the flames.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was hardly at work when Polycarp came running up and took his place
 beside him; but beyond that Kent paid no attention to the others, though
 he heard and recognized the voice of Fred De Garmo calling out to some
 one. The smoke which rolled up in uneven volumes as the wind lifted it and
 bore it away, or let it suck backward as it veered for an instant, blinded
 him while he fought. He heard other men gallop up, and after a little some
 one clattered up with a wagon filled with barrels of water. He ran to wet
 his sack, and saw that it was Blumenthall himself, foreman of the Double
 Diamond, who drove the team.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lucky it ain't as windy as it was yesterday and the day before,"
 Blumenthall cried out, as Kent stepped upon the brake block to reach a
 barrel. "It'd sweep the whole country if it was."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent nodded, and ran back to the fire, trailing the dripping sack after
 him. As he passed Polycarp and another, he heard Polycarp saying something
 about Man Fleetwood's fire guard; but he did not stop to hear what it was.
 Polycarp was always talking, and he didn't always keep too closely to
 facts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, of a sudden, he saw men dimly when he glanced down the leaping fire
 line, and he knew that the fire was almost conquered. Another frenzied
 minute or two, and he was standing in a group of men, who dropped their
 charred, blackened fragments of blanket and bags, and began to feel for
 their smoking material, while they stamped upon stray embers which looked
 live enough to be dangerous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, she's out," said a voice, "But it did look for a while as if it'd
 get away in spite of us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent turned away, wiping an eye which held a cinder fast under the lid. It
 was Fred De Garmo who spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If somebody'd been watchin' the railroad a leetle might closer?"
 Polycarp began, in his thin, rasping voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fred cut him short. "I thought you laid it to Man Fleetwood, burning fire
 guards," he retorted. "Keep on, and you'll get it right pretty soon. This
 never come from the railroad; you can gamble on that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blumenthall had left his team and come among them. "If you want to know
 how it started, I can tell you. Somebody dropped a match, or a cigarette,
 or something, by the trail up here a ways. I saw where it started when I
 went to Cold Spring after the last load of water. And if I knew who it was?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp launched his opinion first, as usual. "Well, I don't <i>know</i>
 who done it?but, by granny! I can might' nigh guess who it was.
 There's jest one man that I know of been traveling that trail lately when
 he wa'n't in his sober senses?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here Manley Fleetwood rode up to them, coughing at the soot his horse
 kicked up. "Say! you fellows come on over to the house and have something
 to eat?and," he added significantly, "something <i>wet</i>. I told
 my wife, when I saw the fire, to make plenty of coffee, for fighting
 fire's hungry work, let me tell. Come on?no hanging back, you know.
 There'll be lots of coffee, and I've got a quart of something better
 cached in the haystack!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he had said, fighting fire is hungry work, and none save Blumenthall,
 who was dyspeptic and only ate twice a day, and then of certain foods
 prepared by himself, declined the invitation.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII. VAL'S NEW DUTIES
 </h2>
 <p>
 To Val the days of heat and smoke, and the isolation, had made life seem
 unreal, like a dream which holds one fast and yet is absurd and utterly
 improbable. Her past was pushed so far from her that she could not even
 long for it as she had done during the first few weeks. There were nights
 of utter desolation, when Manley was in town upon some errand which
 prevented his speedy return?nights when the coyotes howled much
 louder than usual, and she could not sleep for the mysterious snapping and
 creaking about the shack, but lay shivering with fear until dawn; but not
 for worlds would she have admitted to Manley her dread of staying alone.
 She believed it to be necessary, or he would not require it of her, and
 she wanted to be all that he expected her to be. She was very sensitive,
 in those days, about doing her whole duty as a wife?the wife of a
 Western rancher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For that reason, when Manley shouted to her the news of the fire as he
 galloped past the shack, and told her to have something for the men to eat
 when the fire was out, she never thought of demurring, or explaining to
 him that there was scarcely any wood, and that she could not cook a meal
 without fuel. Instead, she waved her hand to him and let him go; and when
 he was quite out of sight she went up to the corrals to see if she could
 find another useless pole, or a broken board or two which her slight
 strength would be sufficient to break up with the axe. Till she came to
 Montana, Val had never taken an axe in her hands; but its use was only one
 of the many things she must learn, of which she had all her life been
 ignorant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was an old post there, lying beside a rusty, overturned plow. More
 than once she had stopped and eyed it speculatively, and the day before
 she had gone so far as to lift an end of it tentatively; but she had found
 it very heavy, and she had also disturbed a lot of black bugs that went
 scurrying here and there, so that she was forced to gather her skirts
 close about her and run for her life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where Manley had built his hayrack she had yesterday discovered some ends
 of planking hidden away in the rank, ripened weeds and grass. She went
 there now, but there were no more, look closely as she might. She circled
 the evil-smelling stable in discouragement, picked up one short piece of
 rotten board, and came back to the post. As she neared it she
 involuntarily caught her skirts and held them close, in terror of the
 black bugs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She eyed it with extreme disfavor, and finally ventured to poke it with
 her slipper toe; one lone bug scuttled out and away in the tall weeds.
 With the piece of board she turned it over, stared hard at the yellowed
 grass beneath, discovered nothing so very terrifying after all, and, in
 pure desperation, dragged the post laboriously down to the place where had
 been the woodpile. Then, lifting the heavy axe, she went awkwardly to work
 upon it, and actually succeeded, in the course of half an hour or so, in
 worrying an armful of splinters off it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She started a fire, and then she had to take the big zinc pail and carry
 some water down from the spring before she could really begin to cook
 anything. Manley's work, every bit of it?but then Manley was so very
 busy, and he couldn't remember all these little things, and Val hated to
 keep reminding him. Theoretically, Manley objected to her chopping wood or
 carrying water, and always seemed to feel a personal resentment when he
 discovered her doing it. Practically, however, he was more and more often
 making it necessary for her to do these things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That is why he returned with the fire fighters and found Val just laying
 the cloth upon the table, which she had moved into the front room so that
 there would be space to seat her guests at all four sides. He frowned when
 he looked in and saw that they must wait indefinitely, and her cheeks took
 on a deeper shade of pink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything will be ready in ten minutes," she hurriedly assured him. "How
 many are there, dear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eight, counting myself," he answered gruffly. "Get some clean towels, and
 we'll go up to the spring to wash; and try and have dinner ready when we
 get back?we're half starved." With the towels over his arm, he led
 the way up to the spring. He must have taken the trail which led past the
 haystack, for he returned in much better humor, and introduced the men to
 his wife with the genial air of a host who loves to entertain largely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stood back and watched them file in to the table and seat themselves
 with a noisy confusion. Unpolished they were, in clothes and manner,
 though she dimly appreciated the way in which they refrained from looking
 at her too intently, and the conscious lowering of their voices while they
 talked among themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They did, however, glance at her surreptitiously while she was moving
 quietly about, with her flushed cheeks and her yellow-brown hair falling
 becomingly down at the temples because she had not found a spare minute in
 which to brush it smooth, and her dainty dress and crisp, white apron. She
 was not like the women they were accustomed to meet, and they paid her the
 high tribute of being embarrassed by her presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She poured coffee until all the cups were full, replenished the bread
 plate and brought more butter, and hunted the kitchen over for the can
 opener, to punch little holes in another can of condensed cream; and she
 rather astonished her guests by serving it in a beautiful cut-glass
 pitcher instead of the can in which it was bought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They handled the pitcher awkwardly because of their mental uneasiness, and
 Val shared with them their fear of breaking it, and was guilty of an
 audible sigh of relief when at last it found safety upon the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So perturbed was she that even when she decided that she could do no more
 for their comfort and retreated to the kitchen, she failed to realize that
 the one extra plate meant an absent guest, and not a miscount in placing
 them, as she fancied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She remembered that she would need plenty of hot water to wash all those
 dishes, and the zinc pail was empty; it always was, it seemed to her, no
 matter how often she filed it. She took the tin dipper out of it, so that
 it would not rattle and betray her purpose to Manley, sitting just inside
 the door with his back toward her, and tiptoed quite guiltily out of the
 kitchen. Once well away from the shack, she ran.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She reached the spring quite out of breath, and she actually bumped into a
 man who stood carefully rinsing a bloodstained handkerchief under the
 overflow from the horse trough. She gave a little scream, and the pail
 went rolling noisily down the steep bank and lay on its side in the mud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent turned and looked at her, himself rather startled by the unexpected
 collision. Involuntarily he threw out his hand to steady her. "How do you
 do, Mrs. Fleetwood?" he said, with all the composure he could muster to
 his aid. "I'm afraid I scared you. My nose got to bleeding?with the
 heat, I guess. I just now managed to stop it." He did not consider it
 necessary to explain his presence, but he did feel that talking would help
 her recover her breath and her color. "It's a plumb nuisance to have the
 nosebleed so much," he added plaintively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was still trembling and staring at him with her odd, yellow-brown
 eyes. He glanced at her swiftly, and then bent to squeeze the water from
 his handkerchief; but his trained eyes saw her in all her dainty
 allurement; saw how the coppery sunlight gave a strange glint to her hair,
 and how her eyes almost matched it in color, and how the pupils had
 widened with fright. He saw, too, something wistful in her face, as though
 life was none too kind to her, and she had not yet abandoned her first
 sensation of pained surprise that it should treat her so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what I get for running," she said, still panting a little as she
 watched him. "I thought all the men were at the table, you see. Your
 dinner will be cold, Mr. Burnett."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent was a bit surprised at the absence of cold hauteur in her manner; his
 memory of her had been so different.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm used to cold grub," he smiled over his shoulder. "And, anyway,
 when your nose gets to acting up with you, it's like riding a pitching
 horse; you've got to pass up everything and give it all your time and
 attention." Then, with the daring that sometimes possessed him like a
 devil, he looked straight at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure you intend to give me my dinner?" he quizzed, his lips' lifting
 humorously at the corners. "I kinda thought, from the way you turned me
 down cold when we met before, you'd shut your door in my face if I came
 pestering around. How <i>about</i> that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Little flames of light nickered in her eyes. "You are the guest of my
 husband, here by his invitation," she answered him coldly. "Of course I
 shall give you your dinner, if you want any."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He inspected his handkerchief critically, decided that it was not quite
 clean, and held it again under the stream of water. "If I want it?yes,"
 he drawled maliciously. "Maybe I'm not sure about that part. Are you a
 pretty fair cook?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps you'd better interview your friends," she retorted, "if you are
 so very fastidious. I?" She drew her brows together, as if she was
 in doubt as to the proper method of dealing with this impertinence. She
 suspected that he was teasing her purposely, but still?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I can eat 'most any old thing," he assured her, with calm effrontery.
 "You look as if you'd learn easy, and Man ain't the worst cook I ever ate
 after. If he's trained you faithful, maybe it'll be safe to take a change.
 How <i>about</i> that? Can you make sour-dough bread yet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" she flung the word at him. "And I don't want to learn," she added,
 at the expense of her dignity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent shook his head disapprovingly. "That sure ain't the proper spirit to
 show," he commented. "Man must have to beat you up a good deal, if you
 talk back to <i>him</i> that way." He eyed her sidelong. "You're a real
 little wolf, aren't you?" He shook his head again solemnly, and sighed. "A
 fellow sure must build himself lots of trouble when he annexes a wife?a
 wife that won't learn to make sour-dough bread, and that talks back. I'm
 plumb sorry for Man. We used to be pretty good friends?" He stopped
 short, his face contrite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was looking away, and she was winking very fast. Also, her lips were
 quivering unmistakably, though she was biting them to keep them steady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent stared at her helplessly. "Say! I never thought you'd mind a little
 joshing," he said gently, when the silence was growing awkward. "I ought
 to be killed! You?you must get awful lonesome?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned her face toward him quickly, as if he were the first person who
 had understood her blank loneliness. "That," she told him, in an odd,
 hesitating manner, "atones for the?the 'joshing.' No one seems to
 realize?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you get out and ride around, or do something beside stick right
 here in this coulee like a?a cactus?" he demanded, with a roughness
 that somehow was grateful to her. "I'll bet you haven't been a mile from
 the ranch since Man brought you here. Why don't you go to town with him
 when he goes? It'd be a whole lot better for you?for both of you.
 Have you got acquainted with any of the women here yet? I'll gamble you
 haven't!" He was waving the handkerchief gently like a flag, to dry it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val watched him; she had never seen any one hold a handkerchief by the
 corners and wave it up and down like that for quick drying, and the
 expedient interested her, even while she was wondering if it was quite
 proper for him to lecture her in that manner. His scolding was even more
 confusing than his teasing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been down to the river twice," she defended weakly, and was angry
 with herself that she could not find words with which to quell him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really?" He down at her indulgently. "How did you ever manage to get so
 far? It must be all of half a mile!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you're perfectly horrible!" she flashed suddenly. "I don't see how it
 can possibly concern you whether I go anywhere or not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It does, though. I'm a lot public-spirited. I hate to see taxes go up,
 and every lunatic that goes to the asylum costs the State just that much
 more. I don't know an easier recipe for going crazy than just to stay off
 alone and think. It's a fright the way it gets sheep-herders, and such."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm <i>such</i>, I suppose!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent glanced at her, approved mentally of the color in her cheeks and the
 angry light in her eyes, and laughed at her quite openly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's nothing like getting good and mad once in a while, to take the
 kinks out of your brain," he observed. "And there's nothing like
 lonesomeness to put 'em in. A good fighting mad is what you need, now and
 then; I'll have to put Man next, I guess. He's too mild."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No one could accuse you of that," she retorted, laughing a little in
 spite of herself. "If I were a man I should want to blacken your eyes?"
 And she blushed hotly at being betrayed into a personality which seemed to
 her undignified, and, what was worse, unrefined. She turned her back
 squarely toward him, started down the path, and remembered that she had
 not filled the water bucket, and that without it she could not
 consistently return to the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent interpreted her glance, went sliding down the steep bank and
 recovered the pail; he was laughing to himself while he rinsed and filled
 it at the spring, but he made no effort to explain his amusement. When he
 came back to where she stood watching him, Val gave her head a slight
 downward tilt to indicate her thanks, turned, and led the way back to the
 house without a word. And he, following after, watched her slim figure
 swinging lightly down the hill before him, and wondered vaguely what sort
 of a hell her life was going to be, out here where everything was
 different from what she had been accustomed to, and where she did not seem
 to "fit into the scenery," as he put it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ought to learn to ride horseback," he advised unexpectedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me?you ought to learn to wait until your advice is wanted,"
 she replied calmly, without turning her head. And she added, with a sort
 of defiance: "I do not feel the need of either society or diversion, I
 assure you; I am perfectly contented."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's real nice," he approved. "There's nothing like being satisfied
 with what's handed out to you." But, though he spoke with much unconcern,
 his tone betrayed his skepticism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others had finished eating and were sitting upon their heels in the
 shade of the house, smoking and talking in that desultory fashion common
 to men just after a good meal. Two or three glanced rather curiously at
 Kent and his companion, and he detected the covert smile on the
 scandal-hungry face of Polycarp Jenks, and also the amused twist of Fred
 De Garmo's lips. He went past them without a sign of understanding, set
 the water pail down in its proper place upon a bench inside the kitchen
 door, tilted his hat to Val, who happened to be looking toward him at that
 moment, and went out again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the hurry, Kenneth?" quizzed Polycarp, when Kent started toward
 the corral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Follow my trail long enough and you'll find out?maybe," Kent
 snapped in reply. He felt that the whole group was watching hum, and he
 knew that if he looked back and caught another glimpse of Fred De Garmo's
 sneering face he would feel compelled to strike it a blow. There would be
 no plausible explanation, of course, and Kent was not by nature a trouble
 hunter; and so he chose to ride away without his dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While Polycarp was still wondering audibly what was the matter, Kent
 passed the house on his gray, called "So-long, Man," with scarcely a
 glance at his host, and speedily became a dim figure in the smoke haze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He must be runnin' away from you, Fred," Polycarp hinted, grinning
 cunningly. "What you done to him?hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fred answered him with an unsatisfactory scowl. "You sure would be wise,
 if you found out everything you wanted to know," he said contemptuously,
 after an appreciable Wait. "I guess we better be moving along, Bill." He
 rose, brushed off his trousers with a downward sweep of his hands, and
 strolled toward the corrals, followed languidly by Bill Madison.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As if they had been waiting for a leader, the others rose also and
 prepared to depart. Polycarp proceeded, in his usual laborious manner, to
 draw his tobacco from his pocket, and pry off a corner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you burn them guards now, Manley, while you got plenty of
 help?" he suggested, turning his slit-lidded eyes toward the kitchen door,
 where Val appeared for an instant to reach the broom which stood outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I don't want to," snapped Manley: "I've got plenty to do without
 that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they ain't wide enough, nor long enough, and they don't run in the
 right direction?if you ask me." Polycarp spat solemnly off to the
 right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't ask you, as it happens." Manley turned and went into the home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp looked quizzically at the closed door. "He's mighty touchy about
 them guards, for a feller that thinks they're all right?<i>he-he!</i>"
 he remarked, to no one in particular. "Some of these days, by granny,
 he'll wisht he'd took my advice!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since no one gave him the slightest attention, Polycarp did not pursue the
 subject further. Instead, with both ears open to catch all that was said,
 he trailed after the others to the corral. It was a matter of instinct, as
 well as principle, with Polycarp Jenks, to let no sentence, however
 trivial, slip past his hearing and his memory.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII. THE PRAIRIE FIRE
 </h2>
 <p>
 A calamity expected, feared, and guarded against by a whole community does
 sometimes occur, and with a suddenness which finds the victims unprepared
 in spite of all their elaborate precautions. Compared with the importance
 of saving the range from fire, it was but a trivial thing which took
 nearly every man who dwelt in Lonesome Land to town on a certain day when
 the wind blew free from out the west. They were weary of watching for the
 fire which did not come licking through the prairie grass, and a special
 campaign train bearing a prospective President of our United States was
 expected to pass through Hope that afternoon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since all trains watered at the red tank by the creek, there would be a
 five-minute stop, during which the prospective President would stand upon
 the rear platform and deliver a three-minute address?a few gracious
 words to tickle the self-esteem of his listeners?and would employ
 the other two minutes in shaking the hand of every man, woman, and child
 who could reach him before the train pulled out. There would be a cheer or
 two given as he was borne away?and there would be something to talk
 about afterward in the saloons. Scarce a man of then had ever seen a
 President, and it was worth riding far to look upon a man who even hoped
 for so exalted a position.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley went because he intended to vote for the man, and called it an act
 of loyalty to his party to greet the candidate; also because it took very
 little, now that haying was over and work did not press, to start him down
 the trail in the direction of Hope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the Blumenthall ranch no man save the cook remained at home, and he
 only because he had a boil on his neck which sapped his interest in all
 things else. Polycarp Jenks was in town by nine o'clock, and only one man
 remained at the Wishbone. That man was Kent, and he stayed because,
 according to his outraged companions, he was an ornery cuss, and his bump
 of patriotism was a hollow in his skull. Kent had told them, one and all,
 that he wouldn't ride twenty-five miles to shake hands with the Deity
 Himself?which, however, is not a verbatim report of his statement.
 The prospective President had not done anything so big, he said, that a
 man should want to break his neck getting to town just to watch him go by.
 He was dead sure he, for one, wasn't going to make a fool of himself over
 any swell-headed politician.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still, he saddled and rode with his fellows for a mile or two, and called
 them unseemly names in a facetious tone; and the men of the Wishbone
 answered his taunts with shrill yells of derision when he swung out of the
 trail and jogged away to the south, and finally passed out of sight in the
 haze which still hung depressingly over the land.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Oddly enough, while all the able-bodied men save Kent were waiting
 hilariously in Hope to greet, with enthusiasm, the brief presence of the
 man who would fain be their political chief, the train which bore him
 eastward scattered fiery destruction abroad as it sped across their range,
 four minutes late and straining to make up the time before the next stop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had thought the railroad safe at last, what with the guards and the
 numerous burned patches where the fire had jumped the plowed boundary and
 blackened the earth to the fence which marked the line of the right of
 way, and, in some places, had burned beyond. It took a flag-flying special
 train of that bitter Presidential campaign to find a weak spot in the
 guard, and to send a spark straight into the thickest bunch of wiry sand
 grass, where the wind could fan it to a blaze and then seize it and bend
 the tall flame tongues until they licked around the next tuft of grass,
 and the next, and the next?until the spark was grown to a long,
 leaping line of fire, sweeping eastward with the relentless rush of a
 tidal wave upon a low-lying beach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline Hawley was, perhaps, the only citizen of Hope who had deliberately
 chosen to absent herself from the crowd standing, in perspiring
 expectation, upon the depot platform. She had permitted Minnie, the
 "breed" girl, to go, and had even grudgingly consented to her using a box
 of cornstarch as first aid to her complexion. Arline had not approved,
 however, of either the complexion or the occasion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What you want to go and plaster your face up with starch for, gits me,"
 she had criticised frankly. "Seems to me you're homely enough without
 lookin' silly, into the bargain. Nobody's going to look at you, no matter
 what you do. They're out to rubber at a higher mark than you be. And what
 they expect to see so great, gits me. He ain't nothing but a man?and,
 land knows, men is common enough, and ornery enough, without runnin' like
 a band of sheep to see one. I don't see as he's any better, jest because
 he's runnin' for President; if he gits beat, he'll want to hide his head
 in a hole in the ground. Look at my Walt. <i>He</i> was the biggest man in
 Hope, and so swell-headed he wouldn't so much as pack a bucket of water
 all fall, or chop up a tie for kindlin'?till the day after 'lection.
 And what was he then but a frazzled-out back number, that everybody give
 the laugh?till he up and blowed his brains out! Any fool can <i>run</i>
 for President?it's the feller that gits there that counts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, that red-white-'n'-blue ribbon sure looks fierce on that green dress?but
 I reckon blood will tell, even if it's Injun blood. G'wan, or you'll be
 late and have your trouble for your pay. But hurry back soon's the agony's
 over; the bread'll be ready to mix out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Even after the girl was gone, her finery a-flutter in the sweeping west
 wind, Arline muttered aloud her opinion of men, and particularly of
 politicians who rode about in special trains and expected the homage of
 their fellows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was in the back yard, taking her "white clothes" off the line, when
 the special came puffing slowly into town. To emphasize her disapproval of
 the whole system of politics, she turned her back square toward it, and
 laid violent hold of a sheet. There was a smudge of cinders upon its white
 surface, and it crushed crisply under her thumb with the unmistakable feel
 of burned grass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, what in time?" began Arline aloud, after the manner of women
 whose tongues must keep pace with their thoughts. "That there feels fresh
 and"?with a sniff at the spot?"<i>smells</i> fresh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With the wisdom of much experience she faced the hot wind and sniffed
 again, while her eyes searched keenly the sky line, which was the ragged
 top of the bluff marking the northern boundary of the great prairie land.
 A trifle darker it was there, and there was a certain sullen glow
 discernible only to eyes trained to read the sky for warning signals of
 snow, fire, and flood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a fire, and it's this side of the river. And if it is, then the
 railroad set it, and there ain't a livin' thing to stop it. An' the wind's
 jest right?" A curdled roll of smoke showed plainly for a moment in
 the haze. She crammed her armful of sheets into the battered willow
 basket, threw two clothespins hastily toward the same receptacle, and ran.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The special had just come to a stop at the depot. The cattlemen, cowboys,
 and townspeople were packed close around the rear of the train, their
 backs to the wind and the disaster sweeping down upon them, their browned
 faces upturned to the sleek, carefully groomed man in the light-gray suit,
 with a flaunting, prairie sunflower ostentatiously displayed in his
 buttonhole and with his campaign smile upon his lips and dull boredom
 looking out of his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ladies and gentlemen," he was saying, as he smiled, "you favoured ones
 whose happy lot it is to live in the most glorious State of our glorious
 union, I greet you, and I envy you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline, with her soiled kitchen apron, her ragged coil of dust-brown hair,
 her work-drawn face and faded eyes which blazed with excitement, pushed
 unceremoniously through the crowd and confronted him undazzled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mister Candidate, you better move on and give these men a chancet to save
 their prope'ty," she cried shrilly. "They got something to do besides
 stand around here and listen at you throwin' campaign loads. The hull
 country's afire back of us, and the wind bringin' it down on a long lope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned from the astounded candidate and glared at the startled crowd,
 every one of whom she knew personally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I must say I got my opinion of a bunch that'll stand here swallowin' a
 lot of hot air, while their coat tails is most ready to ketch afire!" Her
 voice was rasping, and it carried to the farthest of them. "You make me <i>tired!</i>
 Political slush, all of it?and the hull darned country a-blazin'
 behind you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The crowd moved uneasily, then scattered away from the shelter of the
 depot to where they could snuff inquiringly the wind, like dogs in the
 leash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's right," yelled Blumenthall, of the Double Diamond. "There's a
 fire, sure as hell!" He started to run.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man behind him hesitated but a second, then gripped his hat against
 the push of the wind, and began running. Presently men, women, and
 children were running, all in one direction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The prospective President stood agape upon the platform of his
 bunting-draped car, his chosen allies grouped foolishly around him. It was
 the first time men had turned from his presence with his gracious,
 flatteringly noncommittal speech unuttered, his hand unshaken, his
 smiling, bowing departure unmarked by cheers growing fainter as he
 receded. Only Arline tarried, her thin fingers gripping the arm of her
 "breed girl," lest she catch the panic and run with the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline tilted back her head upon her scrawny shoulders and eyed the
 prospective President with antagonism unconcealed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got something to say to you before you go," she announced, in her
 rasping voice, with its querulous note. "I want to tell you that the
 chances are a hundred to one you set that fire yourself, with your engine
 that's haulin' you around over the country, so you can jolly men into
 votin' for you. Your train's the only one over the road since noon, and
 that fire started from the railroad. The hull town's liable to burn,
 unless it can be stopped the other side the creek, to say nothing of the
 range, that feeds our stock, and the hay, and maybe houses?and maybe
 <i>people!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She caught her breath, and almost shrieked the last three words, as a
 dreadful probability flashed into her mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know a woman?just a girl?and she's back there twenty mile?<i>alone</i>,
 and her man's here to look at you go by! I hope you git beat, just for
 that!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If this town ketches afire and burns up, I hope you run into the ditch
 before you git ten mile! If you was a man, and them fellers with you was
 men, you'd hold up your train and help save the town. Every feller counts,
 when it comes to fightin' fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stopped and eyed the group keenly. "But you won't. I don't reckon you
 ever done anything with them hands in your life that would grind a little
 honest dirt into your knuckles and under them shiny nails!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The prospective President turned red to his ears, and hastily removed his
 immaculate hands from where they had been resting upon the railing. And he
 did not hold up the train while he and his allies stopped to help save the
 town. The whistle gave a warning toot, the bell jangled, and the train
 slid away toward the next town, leaving Arline staring, tight-lipped,
 after it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The darned chump?he'd 'a' made votes hand over fist if he'd called
 my bluff; but, I knew he wouldn't, soon as I seen his face. He ain't man
 enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's real good-lookin'," sighed Minnie, feebly attempting to release her
 arm from the grasp of her mistress. "And did you notice the fellow with
 the big yellow mustache? He kept eyin' me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't wonder?but it ain't anything to your credit," snapped
 Arline, facing her toward the hotel, "You do look like sin a-flyin', in
 that green dress, and with all that starch on your face. You git along to
 the house and mix that bread, first thing you do, and start a fire. And if
 I ain't back by that time, you go ahead with the supper; you know what to
 git. We're liable to have all the tables full, so you set all of 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was hurrying away, when the girl called to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you mean Mis' Fleetwood, when you said that about the woman burning?
 And do you s'pose she's really in the fire?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shut up and go along!" cried Arline roughly, under the stress of her
 own fears. "How in time's anybody going to tell, that's twenty miles
 away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She left the street and went hurrying through back yards and across vacant
 lots, crawled through a wire fence, and so reached, without any roundabout
 method, the trail which led to the top of the bluff, where the whole town
 was breathlessly assembling. Her flat-chested, un-corseted figure merged
 into the haze as she half trotted up the steep road, swinging her arms
 like a man, her skirts flapping in the wind. As she went, she kept
 muttering to herself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If she really is caught by the fire?and her alone?and Man
 more'n half drunk?" She whirled, and stood waiting for the horseman
 who was galloping up the trail behind her. "You going home, Man? You don't
 think it could git to your place, do you?" She shouted the questions at
 him as he pounded past.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, sallow white with terror, shook his head vaguely and swung his
 heavy quirt down upon the flanks of his horse. Arline lowered her head
 against the dust kicked into her face as he went tearing past her, and
 kept doggedly on. Some one came rattling up behind her with empty barrels
 dancing erratically in a wagon, and she left the trail to make room. The
 hostler from their own stable it was who drove, and at the creek ahead of
 them he stopped to fill the barrels. Arline passed him by and kept on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the brow of the hill the women and children were gathered in a
 whimpering group. Arline joined them and gazed out over the prairie, where
 the smoke was rolling toward them, and, lifting here and there, let a
 flare of yellow through.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll show up fine at dark," a fat woman in a buggy remarked. "There's
 nothing grander to look at than a prairie fire at night. I do hope," she
 added weakly, "it don't do no great damage!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it won't," Arline cut in, with savage sarcasm, panting from her
 climb. "It's bound to sweep the hull country slick an' clean, and maybe
 burn us all out?but that won't matter, so long as it looks purty
 after dark!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They say it's a good ten mile away yet," another woman volunteered
 encouragingly. "They'll git it stopped, all right. There's lots of men
 here to fight it, thank goodness!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline moved on to where a plow was being hurriedly unloaded from a wagon,
 the horses hitched to it, and a man already grasping the handles in an
 aggressive manner. As she came up he went off, yelling his opinions and
 turning a shallow, uneven furrow for a back fire. Within five minutes
 another plow was tearing up the sod in an opposite direction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it jumps here, or they can't turn it, the creek'll help a lot," some
 one was yelling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The plowed furrows lengthened, the horses sweating and throwing their
 heads up and down with the discomfort of the pace they must keep.
 Whiplashes whistled and the drivers urged them on with much shouting.
 Blumenthall, cut off, with his men, from reaching his own ranch, was
 directing a group about to set a back fire. His voice boomed as if he were
 shouting across a milling herd. A roll of his eye brought his attention
 momentarily from the work, and he ran toward a horseman who was
 gesticulating wildly and seemed on the point of riding straight toward the
 fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi! Fleetwood, we need you here!" he yelled. "You can't get home now, and
 you know it. The fire's past your place already; you'd have to ride
 through it, you fool! Hey? Your wife home alone?<i>alone!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood absolutely still and stared out to the southwest, where the smoke
 cloud was rolling closer with every breath. He drew his fingers across his
 forehead and glanced at the men around him, also stunned into inactivity
 by the tragedy behind the words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?get to work, men. We've got to save the town. Fine time to
 burn guards?when a fire's loping up on you! But that's the way it
 goes, generally. This ought to've been done a month ago. Put it off and
 put it off?while they haggle over bids?Brinberg, you and I'll
 string the fire. The rest of you watch it don't jump back. And, say!" he
 shouted to the group around Manley. "Don't let that crazy fool start off
 now. Put him to work. Best thing for him. But?my God, that's awful!"
 He did not shout the last sentence. He spoke so that only the nearest man
 heard him?heard, and nodded dumb assent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley raged, sitting helpless there upon his horse. They would not let
 him ride out toward that sweeping wave of fire. He could not have gone
 five miles toward home before he met the flames. He stood in the stirrups
 and shook his fists impotently. He strained his eyes to see what it was
 impossible for him to see?his ranch and Val, and how they had fared.
 He pictured mentally the guard he had burned beyond the coulee to protect
 them from just this danger, and his heart squeezed tight at the
 realization of his own shiftlessness. That guard! A twelve-foot strip of
 half-burned sod, with tufts of grass left standing here and there?and
 he had meant to burn it wider, and had put it off from day to day, until
 now. <i>Now!</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His clenched fist dropped upon the saddle horn, and he stared dully at the
 rushing, rolling smoke and fire. It was not <i>that</i> he saw?it
 was Val, with cinder-blackened ruffles, grimy face, and yellow hair
 falling in loose locks upon her cheeks?locks which she must stop to
 push out of her eyes, so that she could see where to swing the sodden sack
 while she helped him?him, Manley, who had permitted her to do work
 it for none but a man's hard muscles, so that he might finish the sooner
 and ride to town upon some flimsy pretext. And he could not even reach her
 now?or the place where she had been!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The group had thinned around him, for there was something to do besides
 give sympathy to a man bereaved. Unless they bestirred themselves, they
 might all be in need of sympathy before the day was done. Manley took his
 eyes from the coming fire and glanced around him, saw that he was alone,
 and, with a despairing oath, wheeled his horse and raced back down the
 hill to town, as if fiends rode behind the saddle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the saloon opposite the Hawley Hotel he drew up; rather, his horse
 stopped there of his own accord, as if he were quite at home at that
 particular hitching pole. Manley dismounted heavily and lurched inside.
 The place was deserted save for Jim, who was paid to watch the wares of
 his employer, and was now standing upon a chair at the window, that he
 might see over the top of Hawley's coal shed and glimpse the hilltop
 beyond. Jim stepped down and came toward him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's the fire?" he demanded anxiously. "Think she'll swing over this
 way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Manley had sunk into a chair and buried his face in his arms, folded
 upon a whisky-spotted card table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val?my Val!" he wailed, "Back there alone?get me a drink," he
 added thickly, "or I'll go crazy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim hastily poured a full glass, and stood over him anxiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here it is. Drink 'er down, and brace up. What you mean? Is your wife?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley lifted his head long enough to gulp the whisky, then dropped it
 again upon his arms and groaned.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IX. KENT TO THE RESCUE
 </h2>
 <p>
 The fire had been burning a possible half-hour when Kent, jogging
 aimlessly toward a log ridge with the lazy notion of riding to the top and
 taking a look at the country to the west before returning to the ranch,
 first smelled the stronger tang of burned grass and swung instinctively
 into the wind. He galloped to higher ground, and, trained by long watching
 of the prairie to detect the smoke of a nearer fire in the haze of those
 long distant, saw at once what must have happened, and knew also the
 danger. His horse was fresh, and he raced him over the uneven prairie
 toward the blaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was tearing straight across the high ground between Dry Creek and Cold
 Spring Coulee when he first saw it plainly, and he altered his course a
 trifle. The roar of it came faintly on the wind, like the sound of
 storm-beaten surf pounding heavily upon a sand bar when the tide is out,
 except that this roar was continuous, and was full of sharp cracklings and
 sputterings; and there was also the red line of flame to visualize the
 sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When his eyes first swept the mile-long blaze, he felt his helplessness,
 and cursed aloud the man who had drawn all the fighting force from the
 prairie that day. They might at least have been able to harry it and
 hamper it and turn the savage sweep of it into barren ground upon some
 rock-bound coulee's rim. If they could have caught it at the start, or
 even in the first mile of its burning?or, even now, if Blumenthall's
 outfit were on the spot?or if Manley Fleetwood's fire guards held it
 back?He hoped some of them had stayed at home, so that they could
 help fight it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that brief glimpse before he rode down into a hollow and so lost sight
 of it, he knew that the fire they had fought and vanquished before had
 been a puny blaze compared with this one. The ground it had burned was not
 broad enough to do more than check this fire temporarily. It would simply
 burn around the blackened area and rush on and on, until the bend of the
 river turned it back to the north, where the river's first tributary
 stream would stop it for good and all. But before that happened it would
 have done its worst?and its worst was enough to pale the face of
 every prairie dweller.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more he caught sight of the fire as he was riding swiftly across the
 level land to the east of Cold Spring Coulee. He was going to see if
 Manley's fire guards were any good, and if anyone was there ready to fight
 it when it came up; they could set a back fire from the guards, he
 thought, even if the guards themselves were not wide enough to hold the
 main fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pounded heavily down the long trail into the coulee, passed close by
 the house with a glance sidelong to see if anybody was in sight there,
 rounded the corral to follow the trail which wound zigzag up the farther
 coulee wall, and overtook Val, running bareheaded up the hill, dragging a
 wet sack after her. She was panting already from the climb, and she had on
 thin slippers with high heels, he noticed, that impeded her progress and
 promised a sprained ankle before she reached the top. Kent laughed grimly
 when he overtook her; he thought it was like a five-year-old child running
 with a cup of water to put out a burning house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where do you think you're going with that sack?" he called out, by way of
 greeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned a pale, terrified face toward him, and reached up a hand
 mechanically to push her fair hair out of her eyes. "So much smoke was
 rolling into the coulee," she panted, "and I knew there must be a fire.
 And I've never felt quite easy about our guards since Polycarp Jenks said?Do
 you know where it is?the fire?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's between here and the railroad. Give me that sack, and you go on back
 to the house. You can't do any good." And when she handed the sack up to
 him and then kept on up the hill, he became autocratic in his tone. "Go on
 back to the house, I tell you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall not do anything of the kind," she retorted indignantly, and Kent
 gave a snort of disapproval, kicked his horse into a lunging gallop, and
 left her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll spoil your complexion," he cried over his shoulder, "and that's
 about all you will do. You better go back and get a parasol."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val did not attempt to reply, but she refused to let his taunts turn her
 back, and kept stubbornly climbing, though tears of pure rage filled her
 eyes and even slipped over the lids to her cheeks. Before she had reached
 the top, he was charging down upon her again, and the pallor of his face
 told her much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All hell couldn't stop that fire!" he cried, before he was near her, and
 the words were barely distinguishable in the roar which was growing louder
 and more terrifying. <i>"Get back!</i> You want to stand there till it
 comes down on you?" Then, just as he was passing, he saw how white and
 trembling she was, and he pulled up, with Michael sliding his front feet
 in the loose soil that he might stop on that steep slope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't want to go and faint," he remonstrated in a more kindly tone,
 vaguely conscious that he had perhaps seemed brutal. "Here, give me your
 hand, and stick your toe in the stirrup. Ah, don't waste time trying to
 make up your mind?up you come! Don't you want to save the house and
 corrals?and the haystacks? We've got our work cut out, let me tell
 you, if we do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had leaned and lifted her up bodily, helped her to put her foot in the
 stirrup from which he had drawn his own, and he held her beside him while
 he sent Michael down the trail as fast as he dared. It was a good deal of
 a nuisance, having to look after her when seconds were so precious, but he
 couldn't go on and leave her, though she might easily have reached the
 bottom as soon as he if she had not been so frightened. He was afraid to
 trust her; she looked, to him, as if she were going to faint in his arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't want to get scared," he said, as calmly as he could. "It's back
 two or three miles on the bench yet, and I guess we can easy stop it from
 burning anything but the grass. It's this wind, you see. Manley went to
 town, I suppose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she answered weakly. "He went yesterday, and stayed over. I'm all
 alone, and I didn't know what to do, only to go up and try?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No use, up there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were at the corral gate then, and he set her down carefully, then
 dismounted and turned Michael into the corral and shut the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If we can't step it, and I ain't close by, I wish you'd let Michael out,"
 he said hurriedly, his eyes taking in the immediate surroundings and
 measuring the danger which lurked in weeds, grass, and scattered hay. "A
 horse don't have much show when he's shut up, and?Out there where
 that dry ditch runs, we'll back-fire. You take this sack and come and
 watch out my fire don't jump the ditch. We'll carry it around the house,
 just the other side the trail." He was pulling a handful of grass for a
 torch, and while he was twisting it and feeling in his pocket for a match,
 he looked at her keenly. "You aren't going to get hysterics and leave me
 to fight it alone, are you?" he challenged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope I'm not quite such a silly," she answered stiffly, and he smiled
 to himself as he ran along the far side of the ditch with his blazing tuft
 of grass, setting fire to the tangled, brown mat which covered the coulee
 bottom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val followed slowly behind him, watching that the blaze did not blow back
 across the ditch, and beating it out when it seemed likely to do so. Now
 that she could actually do something, she was no more excited than he, if
 one could judge by her manner. She did look sulky, however, at his way of
 treating her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To back-fire on short notice, with no fresh-turned furrow of moist earth,
 but only a shallow little dry ditch with the grass almost meeting over its
 top in places, is ticklish business at best. Kent went slowly, stamping
 out incipient blazes that seemed likely to turn unruly, and not trusting
 Val any more than he was compelled to do. She was a woman, and Kent's
 experience with women of her particular type had not been extensive enough
 to breed confidence in an emergency like this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had no more than finished stringing his line of fire in the irregular
 half circle which enclosed house, corral, stables, and haystacks, and had
 for its eastern half the muddy depression which, in seasons less dry, was
 a fair-sized creek fed by the spring, when a jagged line of fire with an
 upper wall of tumbling, brown smoke, leaped into view at the top of the
 bluff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One thing was in his favor: The grass upon the hillside was scantier than
 on the level upland, and here and there were patches of yellow soil
 absolutely bare of vegetation, where a fire would be compelled to halt and
 creep slowly around. Also, fire usually burns slower down a hill than over
 a level. On the other hand, the long, seamlike depressions which ran to
 the top were filled with dry brush, and even the coulee bottom had clumps
 of rosebushes and wild currant, where the flames would revel briefly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But already the black, smoking line which curved around the haystacks to
 the north, and around the house toward the south, was widening with every
 passing second.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val had a tub half filled with water at the house, and that helped
 amazingly by making it possible to keep the sacks wet, so that every blow
 counted as they beat out the ragged tongues of flame which, in that wind,
 would jump here and there the ditch and the road, and go creeping back
 toward the stacks and the buildings. For it was a long line they were
 guarding, and there was a good deal of running up and down in their
 endeavor to be in two places at once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Val, in turning to strike a new-born flame behind her, swept her
 skirt across a tuft of smoldering grass and set herself afire. With the
 excitement of watching all points at once, and with the smoke and smell of
 fire all about her, she did not see what had happened, and must have paid
 a frightful penalty if Kent had not, at that moment, been running past her
 to reach a point where a blaze had jumped the ditch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He swerved, and swung a newly wet sack around her with a force which would
 have knocked her down if he had not at the same time caught and held her.
 Val screamed, and struggled in his arms, and Kent knew that it was of him
 she was afraid. As soon as he dared, he released her and backed away
 sullenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry I didn't have time to say please?you were just ready to go up
 in smoke," he flung savagely over his shoulder. But he found himself
 shaking and weak, so that when he reached the blaze he must beat out, the
 sack was heavy as lead. "Afraid of <i>me</i>?women sure do beat
 hell!" he told himself, when he was a bit steadier. He glanced back at her
 resentfully. Val was stooping, inspecting the damage done to her dress.
 She stood up, looked at him, and he saw that her face was white again, as
 it had been upon the hillside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A moment later he was near her again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Burnett, I'm?ashamed?but I didn't know, and you?you
 startled me," she stopped him long enough to confess, though she did not
 meet his eyes. "You saved?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll be startled worse, if you let the fire hang there in that bunch of
 grass," he interrupted coolly. "Behind you, there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned obediently, and swung her sack down several times upon a
 smoldering spot, and the incident was closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Speedily it was forgotten, also. For with the meeting of the fires, which
 they stood still to watch, a patch of wild rosebushes was caught fairly
 upon both sides, and flared high, with a great snapping and crackling. The
 wind seized upon the blaze, flung it toward them like a great, yellow
 banner, and swept cinders and burning twigs far out over the blackened
 path of the back fire. Kent watched it and hardly breathed, but Val was
 shielding her face from the searing heat with her arms, and so did not see
 what happened then. A burning branch like a long, flaming dagger flew
 straight with the wind and lighted true as if flung by the hand of an
 enemy. A long, neatly tapered stack received it fairly, and Kent's cry
 brought Val's arms down, and her scared eyes staring at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That settles the hay," he exclaimed, and raced for the stacks knowing all
 the while that he could do nothing, and yet panting in his hurry to reach
 the spot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Michael, trampling uneasily in the corral, lifted his head and neighed
 shrilly as Kent passed him on the run. Michael had watched fearfully the
 fire sweeping down upon him, and his fear had troubled Val not a little.
 When she saw Kent pass the gate, she hurried up and threw it open,
 wondering a little that Kent should forget his horse. He had told her to
 see that he was turned loose if the fire could not be stopped?and
 now he seemed to have forgotten it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Michael, with a snort and an upward toss of his head to throw the dragging
 reins away from his feet, left the corral with one jump, and clattered
 away, past the house and up the hill, on the trail which led toward home.
 Val stood for a moment watching him. Could he out-run the fire? He was
 holding his head turned to one side now, so that the reins dangled away
 from his pounding feet; once he stumbled to his knees, but he was up in a
 flash, and running faster than ever. He passed out of sight over the hill,
 and Val, with eyes smarting and cheeks burning from the heat, drew a long
 breath and started after Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent was backing, step by step, away from the heat of the burning stacks.
 The roar, and the crackle, and the heat were terrific; it was as if the
 whole world was burning around them, and they only were left. A brand flew
 low over Val's head as she ran staggeringly, with a bewildered sense that
 she must hurry somewhere and do something immediately, to save something
 which positively must be saved. A spark from the brand fell upon her hand,
 and she looked up stupidly. The heat and the smoke were choking her so
 that she could scarcely breathe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A new crackle was added to the uproar of flames. Kent, still backing from
 the furnace of blazing hay, turned, and saw that the stable, with its roof
 of musty hay, was afire. And, just beyond, Val, her face covered with her
 sooty hands, was staggering drunkenly. He reached her as she fell to her
 knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?can't?fight?any more," she whispered faintly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He picked her up in his arms and hesitated, his face toward the house;
 then ran straight away from it, stumbled across the dry ditch and out
 across the blackened strip which their own back fire had swept clean of
 grass. The hot earth burned his feet through the soles of his riding
 boots, but the wind carried the heat and the smoke away, behind them.
 Clumps of bushes were still burning at the roots, but he avoided them and
 kept on to the far side hill, where a barren, yellow patch, with jutting
 sandstone rocks, offered a resting place. He set Val down upon a rock,
 placed himself beside her so that she was leaning against him, and began
 fanning her vigorously with his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank the Lord, we're behind that smoke, anyhow," he observed, when he
 could get his breath. He felt that silence was not good for the woman
 beside him, though he doubted much whether she was in a condition to
 understand him. She was gasping irregularly, and her body was a dead
 weight against him. "It was sure fierce, there, for a few minutes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked out across the coulee at the burning stables, and waited for the
 house to catch. He could not hope that it would escape, but he did not
 mention the probability of its burning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep your eyes shut," he said. "That'll help some, and soon as we can
 we'll go to the spring and give our faces and hands a good bath." He
 untied his silk neckerchief, shook out the cinders, and pressed it against
 her closed eyes. "Keep that over 'em," he commanded, "till we can do
 better. My eyes are more used to smoke than yours, I guess. Working around
 branding fires toughens 'em some."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still she did not attempt to speak, and she did not seem to have energy
 enough left to keep the silk over her eyes. The wind blew it off without
 her stirring a finger to prevent, and Kent caught it just in time to save
 it from sailing away toward the fire. After that he held it in place
 himself, and he did not try to keep talking. He sat quietly, with his arm
 around her, as impersonal in the embrace as if he were holding a strange
 partner in a dance, and watched the stacks burn, and the stables. He saw
 the corral take fire, rail by rail, until it was all ablaze. He saw hens
 and roosters running heavily, with wings dragging, until the heat toppled
 them over. He saw a cat, with white spots upon its sides, leave the bushes
 down by the creek and go bounding in terror to the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And still the house stood there, the curtains flapping in and out through
 the open windows, the kitchen door banging open and shut as the gusts of
 wind caught it. The fire licked as close as burned ground and rocky creek
 bed would let it, and the flames which had stayed behind to eat the spare
 gleanings died, while the main line raged on up the hillside and
 disappeared in a huge, curling wave of smoke. The stacks burned down to
 blackened, smoldering butts. The willows next the spring, and the
 chokecherries and wild currants withered in the heat and waved charred,
 naked arms impotently in the wind. The stable crumpled up, flared, and
 became a heap of embers. The corral was but a ragged line of smoking,
 half-burned sticks and ashes. Spirals of smoke, like dying camp fires,
 blew thin ribbons out over the desolation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent drew a long breath and glanced down at the limp figure in his arms.
 She lay so very still that in spite of a quivering breath now and then he
 had a swift, unreasoning fear she might be dead. Her hair was a tangled
 mass of gold upon her head, and spilled over his arm. He carefully picked
 a flake or two of charred grass from the locks on her temples, and
 discovered how fine and soft was the hair. He lifted the grimy neckerchief
 from her eyes and looked down at her face, smoke-soiled and reddened from
 the heat. Her lips were drooped pitifully, like a hurt child. Her lashes,
 he noticed for the first time, were at least four shades darker than her
 hair. His gaze traveled on down her slim figure to her ringed fingers
 lying loosely in her lap, a long, dry-looking blister upon one hand near
 the thumb; down to her slippers, showing beneath her scorched skirt. And
 he drew another long breath. He did not know why, but he had a strange,
 fleeting sense of possession, and it startled him into action.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You gone to sleep?" he called gently, and gave her a little shake. "We
 can get to the spring now, if you feel like walking that far; if you
 don't, I reckon I'll have to carry you?for I sure do want a drink!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She half lifted her lashes and let them drop again, as if life were not
 worth the effort of living. Kent hesitated, set his lips tightly together,
 and lifted her up straighter. His eyes were intent and stern, as though
 some great issue was at stake, and he must rouse her at once, in spite of
 everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, this won't do at all," he said?but he was speaking to himself
 and his quivering nerves, more than to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sighed, made a conscious effort, and half opened her eyes again. But
 she seemed not to share his anxiety for action, and her mental and
 physical apathy were not to be mistaken. The girl was utterly exhausted
 with fire-fighting and nervous strain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem to be all in," he observed, his voice softly complaining. "Well,
 I packed you over here, and I reckon I better pack you back again?if
 you <i>won't</i> try to walk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She muttered something, of which Kent only distinguished "a minute." But
 she was still limp, and absolutely without interest in anything, and so,
 after a moment of hesitation, he gathered her up in his arms and carried
 her back to the house, kicked the door savagely open, took her in through
 the kitchen, and laid her down upon the couch, with a sigh of relief that
 he was rid of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The couch was gay with a bright, silk spread of "crazy" patchwork, and
 piled generously with dainty cushions, too evidently made for ornamental
 purposes than for use. But Kent piled the cushions recklessly around her,
 tucked her smudgy skirts close, went and got a towel, which he immersed
 recklessly in the water pail, and bathed her face and hands with clumsy
 gentleness, and pushed back her tangled hair. The burn upon her hand
 showed an angry red around the white of the blister, and he laid the wet
 towel carefully upon it. She did not move.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a man, and he had lived all his life among men. He could fight
 anything that was fightable. He could save her life, but after this slight
 attention to her comfort he had reached the limitations set by his purely
 masculine training. He lowered the shades so that the room was dusky and
 as cool as any other place in that fire-tortured land, and felt that he
 could no do more for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood for a moment looking down at the inert, grimy little figure
 stretched out straight, like a corpse, upon the bright-hued couch, her
 eyes closed and sunken, with blue shadows beneath, her lips pale and still
 with that tired, pitiful droop. He stooped and rearranged the wet towel on
 her burned hand, held his face close above hers for a second, sighed,
 frowned, and tiptoed out into the kitchen, closing the door carefully
 behind him.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER X. DESOLATION
 </h2>
 <p>
 For more than two hours Kent sat outside in the shade of the house, and
 stared out over the black desolation of the coulee. His horse was gone, so
 that he could not ride anywhere?and there was nowhere in particular
 to ride. For twenty miles around there was no woman whom he could bring to
 Val's assistance, even if he had been sure that she needed assistance.
 Several times he tiptoed into the kitchen, opened the door into the front
 room an inch or so, and peered in at her. The third time, she had relaxed
 from the corpselike position, and had thrown an arm up over her face, as
 if she were shielding her eyes from something. He took heart at that, and
 went out and foraged for firewood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a hard-beaten zone around the corral and stables, which had kept
 the fire from spreading toward the house, and the wind had borne the
 sparks and embers back toward the spring, so that the house stood in a
 brown oasis of unburned grass and weeds, scanty enough, it is true, but
 yet a relief from the dead black surroundings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The woodpile had not suffered. A chopping block, a decrepit sawhorse, an
 axe, and a rusty bucksaw marked the spot; also three ties, hacked
 eloquently in places, and just five sticks of wood, evidently chopped from
 a tie by a man in haste. Kent looked at that woodpile, and swore. He had
 always known that Manley had an aversion to laboring with his hands, but
 he was unprepared for such an exhibition of shiftlessness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He savagely attacked the three ties, chopped them into firewood, and piled
 them neatly, and then, walking upon his toes, he made a fire in the
 kitchen stove, filled the woodbox, the teakettle, and the water pail, sat
 out in the shade until he heard the kettle boiling over on the stove, took
 another peep in at Val, and then, moving as quietly as he could, proceeded
 to cook supper for them both.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had been perfectly familiar with the kitchen arrangements in the days
 when Manley was a bachelor, and it interested him and filled him with a
 respectful admiration for woman in the abstract and for Val in particular,
 to see how changed everything was, and how daintily clean and orderly.
 Val's smooth, white hands, with their two sparkly rings and the broad
 wedding band, did not suggest a familiarity with actual work about a
 house, but the effect of her labor and thought confronted him at every
 turn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can see your face in everything you pick up that was made to shine,"
 he commented, standing for a moment while he surveyed the bottom of a
 stewpan. "She don't look it, but that yellow-eyed little dame sure knows
 how to keep house." Then he heard her cough, and set down the stewpan
 hurriedly and went to see if she wanted anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was sitting upon the couch, her two hands pushing back her hair,
 gazing stupidly around her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything's all ready but the tea," Kent announced, in a perfectly
 matter-of-fact tone. "I was just waiting to see how strong you want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val turned her yellow-brown eyes upon him in bewilderment. "Why, Mr.
 Burnett?maybe I wasn't dreaming, then. I thought there was a fire.
 Was there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent grinned. "Kinda. You worked like a son of a gun, too?till there
 wasn't any more to do, and then you laid 'em down for fair. You were all
 in, so I packed you in and put you there where you could be comfortable.
 And supper's ready?but how strong do you want your tea? I kinda had
 an idea," he added lamely, "that women drink tea, mostly. I made coffee
 for myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val let herself drop back among the pretty pillows. "I don't want any. If
 there was a fire," she said dully, "then it's true. Everything's all
 burned up. I don't want any tea. I want to die!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent studied her for a moment. "Well, in that case?shall I get the
 axe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val had closed her eyes, but she opened them again. "I don't care what you
 do," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I aim to please," he told her calmly. "What <i>I'd</i> do, in your
 place, would be to go and put on something that ain't all smoked and
 scorched like a?a ham, and then I'd sit up and drink some tea, and
 be nice about it. But, of course, if you want to cash in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val gave a sob. "I can't help it?I'd just as soon be dead as alive.
 It was bad enough before?and now everything's burned up?and
 all Manley's nice?ha-ay?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," Kent interrupted mercilessly, "I've heard of women doing all kinds
 of fool things?but this is the first time I ever knew one to commit
 suicide over a couple of measly haystacks!" He went out and slammed the
 door so that the house shook, and tramped three times across the kitchen
 floor. "That'll make her so mad at me she won't think about anything else
 for a while," he reasoned shrewdly. But all the while his eyes were shiny,
 and when he winked, his lashes became unaccountably moist. He stopped and
 looked out at the blackened coulee. "Shut into this hole, week after week,
 without a woman to speak to?it must be?damned tough!" he
 muttered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tiptoed up and laid his ear against the inner door, and heard a
 smothered sobbing inside. That did not sound as if she were "mad," and he
 promptly cursed himself for a fool and a brute. With his own judgment to
 guide him, he brewed some very creditable tea, sugared and creamed it
 lavishly, browned a slice of bread on top of the stove?blowing off
 the dust beforehand?after Arline's recipe for making toast, buttered
 it until it dripped oil, and carried it in to her with the air of a man
 who will have peace even though he must fight for it. The forlorn picture
 she made, lying there with her face buried in a pink-and-blue cushion, and
 with her shoulders shaking with sobs, almost made him retreat, quite
 unnerved. As it was, he merely spilled a third of the tea and just missed
 letting the toast slide from the plate to the floor; when he had righted
 his burden he had recovered his composure to a degree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, this won't do at all," he reproved, pulling a chair to the couch by
 the simple method of hooking his toe under a round and dragging it toward
 him. "You don't want Man to come and catch you acting like this. He's
 liable to feel pretty blue himself, and he'll need some cheering up?don't
 you think? I don't know for sure?but I've always been kinda under
 the impression that's what a man gets a wife for. Ain't it? You don't want
 to throw down your cards now. You sit up and drink this tea, and eat this
 toast, and I'll gamble you'll feel about two hundred per cent better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," he urged gently, after a minute. "I never thought a nervy little
 woman like you would give up so easy. I was plumb ashamed of myself, the
 way you worked on that back fire. You had me going, for a while. You're
 just tired out, is all ails you. You want to hurry up and drink this,
 before it gets cold. Come on. I'm liable to feel, insulted if you pass up
 my cooking this way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val choked back the tears, and, without taking her face from the pillow,
 put out the burned hand gropingly until it touched his knee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you?you're good," she said brokenly. "I used to think you were?horrid,
 and I'm a?ashamed. You're good, and I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I ain't going to be good much longer, if you don't get your head
 outa that pillow and drink this tea!" His tone was amused and half
 impatient. But his face?more particularly his eyes?told
 another story, which perhaps it was as well she did not read. "I'll be
 dropping the blamed stuff in another minute. My elbow's plumb getting a
 cramp in it," he added complainingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val made a sound half-way between a sob and a laugh, and sat up. With more
 haste than the occasion warranted, Kent put the tea and toast on the chair
 and started for the kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was bound you'd eat before I did," he explained, "and I could stand a
 cup of coffee myself. And, say! If there's anything more you want, just
 holler, and I'll come on the long lope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val took up the teaspoon, tasted the tea, and then regarded the cup
 doubtfully. She never drank sugar in her tea. She wondered how much of it
 he had put in. Her head ached frightfully, and she felt weak and utterly
 hopeless of ever feeling different.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything all right?" came Kent's voice from the kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," Val answered hastily, trying hard to speak with some life and cheer
 in her tone. "It's lovely?all of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Want more tea?" It sounded, out there, as though he was pushing back his
 chair to rise from the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, this is plenty." Val glanced fearfully toward the kitchen door,
 lifted the teacup, and heroically drank every drop. It was, she
 considered, the least that she could do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had finished eating he came in, and found her nibbling
 apathetically at the toast. She looked up at him with an apology in her
 eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Burnett, don't think I am always so silly," she began, leaning back
 against the piled pillows with a sigh. "I have always thought that I could
 bear anything. But last night I didn't sleep much. I dreamed about fires,
 and that Manley was?dead?and I woke up in a perfect horror. It
 was only ten o'clock. So then I sat up and tried to read, and every five
 minutes I would go out and look at the sky, to see if there was a glow
 anywhere. It was foolish, of course. And I didn't sleep at all to-day,
 either. The minute I would lie down I'd imagine I heard a fire roaring.
 And then it came. But I was all used up before that, so I wasn't really?I
 must have fainted, for I don't remember getting into the house?and I
 do think fainting is the silliest thing! I never did such a thing before,"
 she finished abjectly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well?I guess you had a license to faint if you felt that way,"
 he comforted awkwardly. "It was the smoke and the heat, I reckon; they
 were enough to put a crimp in anybody. Did Man say about when he would be
 back? Because I ought to be moving along; it's quite a walk to the
 Wishbone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?you won't go till Manley comes! Please! I?I'd go crazy,
 here alone, and?and he might not come?he's frequently
 detained. I?I've such a horror of fires?" She certainly looked
 as if she had. She was sitting up straight, her hands held out appealingly
 to him, her eyes big and bright.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure I won't go if you feel that way about it." Kent was half frightened
 at her wild manner. "I guess Man will be along pretty soon, anyway. He'll
 hit the trail as soon as he can get behind the fire, that's a cinch. He'll
 be worried to death about you. And you don't need to be afraid of prairie
 fires any more, Mrs. Fleetwood; you're safe. There can't be any more fires
 till next year, anyway; there's nothing left to burn." He turned his face
 to the window and stared out somberly at the ravaged hillside. "Yes?you're
 dead safe, now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm such a fool," Val confessed, her eyes also turning to the window, "If
 you want to go, I?" Her mouth was quivering, and she did not finish
 the sentence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'll stay till Man comes. He's liable to be along any time, now." He
 glanced at her scorched, smoke-stained dress. "He'll sure think you made a
 hand, all right!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val took the hint, and blushed with true feminine shame that she was not
 looking her best. "I'll go and change," she murmured, and rose wearily.
 "But I feel as if the world had been 'rolled up in a scroll and burned,'
 as the Bible puts it, and as if nothing matters any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It does, though. We'll all go right along living the same as ever, and
 the first snow will make this fire seem as old as the war?except to
 the cattle; they're the ones to get it in the neck this winter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went out and walked aimlessly around in the yard, and went over to the
 smoking remains of the stable, and to the heap of black ashes where the
 stacks had been. Manley would be hard hit, he knew. He wished he would
 hurry and come, and relieve him of the responsibility of keeping Val
 company. He wondered a little, in his masculine way, that women should
 always be afraid when there was no cause for fear. For instance, she had
 stayed alone a good many times, evidently, when there was real danger of a
 fire sweeping down upon her at any hour of the day or night; but now, when
 there was no longer a possibility of anything happening, she had turned
 white and begged him to stay?and Val, he judged shrewdly, was not
 the sort of woman who finds it easy to beg favors of anybody.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There came a sound of galloping, up on the hill, and he turned quickly.
 Dull dusk was settling bleakly down upon the land, but he could see three
 or four horsemen just making the first descent from the top. He shouted a
 wordless greeting, and heard their answering yells. In another minute or
 two they were pulling up at the house, where he had hurried to meet them.
 Val, tucking a side comb hastily into her freshly coiled hair, her pretty
 self clothed all in white linen, appeased eagerly in the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?where's Manley?" she demanded anxiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blumenthall was dismounting near her, and he touched his hat before he
 answered. "We were on the way home, and we thought we'd better ride around
 this way and see how you came out," he evaded. "I see you lost your hay
 and buildings?pretty close call for the house, too, I should judge.
 You must have got here in time to do something, Kent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where's Manley?" Val was growing pale again. "Has anything happened?
 Is he hurt? Tell me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he's all right, Mrs. Fleetwood." Blumenthall glanced meaningly at
 Kent?and Fred De Garmo, sitting to one side of his saddle, looked at
 Polycarp Jenks and smiled slightly. "We left town ahead of him, and
 knocked right along."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val regarded the group suspiciously. "He's coming, then, is he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, certainly. Glad you're all right, Mrs. Fleetwood. That was an awful
 fire?it swept the whole country clean between the two rivers, I'm
 afraid. This wind made it bad." He was tightening his cinch, and now he
 unhooked the stirrup from the horn and mounted again. "We'll have to be
 getting along?don't know, yet, how we came out of it over to the
 ranch. But our guards ought to have stopped it there." He looked at Kent.
 "How did the Wishbone make it?" he inquired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was just going to ask you if you knew," Kent replied, scowling because
 he saw Fred looking at Val in what he considered an impertinent manner.
 "My horse ran off while I was fighting fire here, so I'm afoot. I was
 waiting for Man to show up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll git all of that you want?<i>he-he!</i>" Polycarp cut in
 tactlessly. "Man won't git home t'-night?not unless?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, come on." Fred started along the charred trail which led across the
 coulee and up the farther side. Blumenthall spoke a last, commonplace
 sentence or two, just to round off the conversation and make the
 termination not too abrupt, and they rode away, with Polycarp glancing
 curiously back, now and then, as though he was tempted to stay and gossip,
 and yet was anxious to know all that had happened at the Double Diamond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did Polycarp Jenks mean?about Manley not coming to-night?" Val
 was standing in the doorway, staring after the group of horsemen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing, I guess, Polycarp never does mean anything half the time; he
 just talks to hear his head roar. Man'll come, all right. This bunch
 happened to beat him out, is all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, do you think so? Mr. Blumenthall acted as if there was something?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what can you expect of a man that lives on oatmeal mush and toast
 and hot water?" Kent demanded aggressively. "And Fred De Garmo is always
 grinning and winking at somebody; and that other fellow is a Swede and got
 about as much sense as a prairie dog?and Polycarp is an old granny
 gossip that nobody ever pays any attention to. Man won't stay in town?hell
 be too anxious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's terrible," sighed Val, "about the hay and the stables. Manley will
 be so discouraged?he worked so hard to cut and stack that hay. And
 he was just going to gather the calves together and put them in the river
 field, in a couple of weeks?and now there isn't anything to feed
 them!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess he's coming; I hear somebody." Kent was straining his eyes to see
 the top of the hill, where the dismal sight shadows lay heavily upon the
 dismal black earth. "Sounds to me like a rig, though. Maybe he drove out."
 He left her, went to the wire gate which gave egress from the tiny,
 unkempt yard, and walked along the trail to meet the newcomer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You stay there," he called back, when he thought he heard Val following
 him. "I'm just going to tell him you're all right. You'll get that white
 dress all smudged up in these ashes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the narrow little gully where the trail crossed the half-dry channel
 from the spring he met the rig. The driver pulled up when he caught sight
 of Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's that? Did she git out of it?" cried Arline Hawley, in a breathless
 undertone, "Oh?it's you, is it, Kent? I couldn't stand it?I
 just had to come and see if she's alive. So I made Hank hitch right up?as
 soon as we knew the fire wasn't going to git into all that brush along the
 creek, and run down to the town?and bring me over. And the way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where's Man?" Kent laid a hand upon the wheel and shot the question
 into the stream of Arline's talk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man! I dunno what devil gits into men sometimes. Man went and got drunk
 as a fool soon as he seen the fire and knew what coulda happened out here.
 Started right in to drownd his sorrows before he made sure whether he had
 any to drown! If that ain't like a man, every time! Time we all got back
 to town, and the fire was kiting away from us instead of coming up toward
 us, he was too drunk to do anything. He must of poured it down him by the
 quart. He?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley! Is that you, dear?" It was Val, a slim, white figure against the
 blackness all around her, coming down the trail to see what delayed them.
 "Why don't you come to the house? There <i>is</i> a house, you know. We
 aren't quite burned out. And I'm all right, so there's no need to worry
 any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, ain't that a darned shame?" muttered Arline wrathfully to Kent. "A
 feller that'll drink when he's got a wife like that had oughta be hung!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's me, Arline Hawley!" She raised her voice to its ordinary shrill
 level. "It ain't just the proper time to make a call, I guess, but it's
 better late than never. Man, he was took with one of his spells, so I told
 him I'd come on out and take you back to town. How are you, anyhow? Scared
 plumb to death, I'll bet, when that fire come over the hill. You needn't
 'a' tramped clear down here?we was coming on to the house in a
 minute. I got to chewin' the rag with Kent. Git in; you might as well ride
 back to the house, now you're here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley didn't come?" Val was standing beside the rig, near Kent. Her
 white-clothed figure was indistinct, and her face obscured in the dark.
 Her voice was quiet?lifelessly quiet. "Is he sick?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?of course has nerves was all upset?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Then he <i>is</i> sick?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?nothing dangerous, but?he wasn't feelin' well, so I
 thought I'd come out and take you back with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man was awful worried; you mustn't think he wasn't. He was pretty near
 crazy, for a while."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get in and ride. And you mustn't worry none about Man, nor feel hurt that
 he didn't come. He felt so bad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll walk, thank you; it's only a few steps. And I'm not worried at all.
 I quite understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The team started on slowly, and Mrs. Hawley turned in the seat so that she
 could continue talking without interruption to the two who walked behind.
 But it was Kent who answered her at intervals, when she asked a direct
 question or appeared to be waiting for some comment. Betweenwhiles he was
 wondering if Val did, after all, understand. She knew so little of the
 West and its ways, and her faith in Manley was so firm and unquestioning,
 that he felt sure she was only hurt at what looked very much like an
 indifference to her welfare. He suspected shrewdly that she was thinking
 what she would have done in Manley's place, and was trying to reconcile
 Mrs. Hawley's assurances that Manley was not actually sick or disabled
 with the blunt fact that he had stayed in town and permitted others to
 come out to see if she were alive or dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Kent had another problem to solve. Should he tell her the truth? He
 had never ceased to feel, in some measure, responsible for her position.
 And she was sure to discover the truth before long; not even her innocence
 and her ignorance of life could shield her from that knowledge. He let a
 question or two of Arline's go unanswered while he struggled for a
 decision, but when they reached the house, only one point was dearly
 settled in his mind. Instead of riding as far as he might, and then
 walking across the prairie to the Wishbone, he intended to go on to town
 with them?"to see her through with it."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XI. VAL'S AWAKENING
 </h2>
 <p>
 Val stood just inside the door of the hotel parlor and glanced swiftly
 around at the place of unpleasant memory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I must see Manley before I can tell you whether we shall want to stay
 or not," she replied to Arline's insistence that she "go right up to a
 room" and lie down. "I feel quite well, and you must not bother about me
 at all. If Mr. Burnett will be good enough to send Manley to me?I
 must see him first of all." It was Val in her most unapproachable mood,
 and Arline subsided before it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, I'll go and send word to Man, and see about some supper for
 us. I feel as if <i>I</i> could eat ten-penny nails!" She went out into
 the hall, hesitated a moment, and then boldly invaded the "office."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say! have you got Man rounded up yit?" she demanded of her husband. "And
 how is he, anyhow? That girl ain't got the first idea of what ails him?how
 anybody with the brains and education she's got can be so thick-headed
 gits me. Jim told me Man's been packing a bottle or two home with him
 every trip he's made for the last month?and she don't know a thing
 about it. I'd like to know what 'n time they learn folks back East,
 anyhow; to put their eyes and their sense in their pockets, I guess, and
 go along blind as bats. Where's Kent at? Did he go after him? She won't do
 nothing till she sees Man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that moment Kent came in, and his disgust needed no words. He answered
 Mrs. Hawley's inquiring look with a shake of the head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't do anything with him," he said morosely. "He's so full he don't
 know he's got a wife, hardly. You better go and tell her, Mrs. Hawley.
 Somebody's got to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my heavens!" Arline clutched at the doorknob for moral support. "I
 could no more face them yellow eyes of hern when they blaze up?you
 go tell her yourself, if you want her told. I've got to see about some
 supper for us. I ain't had a bite since dinner, and Min's off gadding
 somewheres?" She hurried away, mentally washing her hands of the
 affair. "Women's got to learn some time what men is," she soliloquized,
 "and I guess she ain't no better than any of the rest of us, that she
 can't learn to take her medicine?but <i>I</i> ain't goin' to be the
 one to tell her what kinda fellow she's tied to. My stunt'll be helpin'
 her pick up the pieces and make the best of it after she's told."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stopped, just inside the dining room, and listened until she heard
 Kent cross the hall from the office and open the parlor door. "Gee! It's
 like a hangin'," she sighed. "If she wasn't so plumb innocent?" She
 started for the door which opened into the parlor from the dining room,
 strongly tempted to eavesdrop. She did yield so far as to put her ear to
 the keyhole, but the silence within impressed her strangely, and she
 retreated to the kitchen and closed the door tightly behind her as the
 most practical method of bidding Satan begone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The silence in the parlor lasted while Kent, standing with his back
 against the door, faced Val and meditated swiftly upon the manner of his
 telling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" she demanded at last. "I am still waiting to see Manley. I am not
 quite a child, Mr. Burnett. I know something is the matter, and you?if
 you have any pity, or any feeling of friendship, you will tell me the
 truth. Don't you suppose I know that Arline was?<i>lying</i> to me
 all the time about Manley? You helped her to lie. So did that other man. I
 waited until I reached town, where I could do something, and now you must
 tell me the truth. Manley is badly hurt, or he is dead. Tell me which it
 is, and take me to him." She spoke fast, as if she was afraid she might
 not be able to finish, though her voice was even and low, it was also flat
 and toneless with her effort to seem perfectly calm and self-controlled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent looked at her, forgot all about leading up to the truth by easy
 stages, as he had intended to do, and gave it to her straight. "He ain't
 either one," he said. "He's drunk!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stared at him. "Drunk!" He could see how even her lips shrank from the
 word. She threw up her head. "That," she declared icily, "I know to be
 impossible!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, do you? Let me tell you that's <i>never</i> impossible with a man,
 not when there's whisky handy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley is not that sort of a man. When he left me, three years ago, he
 promised me never to frequent places where liquor is sold. He never had
 touched liquor; he never was tempted to touch it. But, just to be doubly
 sure, he promised me, on his honor. He has never broken that promise; I
 know, because he told me so." She made the explanation scornfully, as if
 her pride and her belief in Manley almost forbade the indignity of
 explaining. "I don't know why you should come here and insult me," she
 added, with a lofty charity for his sin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see how it can insult you," he contended. "You're got a different
 way of looking at things, but that won't help you to dodge facts. Man's
 drunk. I said it, and I mean it. It ain't the first time, nor the second.
 He was drunk the day you came, and couldn't meet the train. That's why I
 met you. I ought to've told you, I guess, but I hated to make you feel
 bad. So I went to work and sobered him up, and sent him over to get
 married. I've always been kinda sorry for that. It was a low-down trick to
 play on you, and that's a fact. You ought to've had a chance to draw outa
 the game, but I didn't think about it at the time. Man and I have always
 been pretty good friends, and I was thinking of <i>his</i> side of the
 case. I thought he'd straighten up after he got married; he wasn't such a
 hard drinker?only he'd go on a toot when he got into town, like lots
 of men. I didn't think it had such a strong hold on him. And I knew he
 thought a lot of you, and if you went back on him it'd hit him pretty
 hard. Man ain't a bad fellow, only for that. And he's liable to do better
 when he finds out you know about it. A man will do 'most anything for a
 woman he thinks a lot of."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed!" Val was sitting now upon the red plush chair. Her face was
 perfectly colorless, her manner frozen. The word seemed to speak itself,
 without having any relation whatever to her thoughts and her emotions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent waited. It seemed to him that she took it harder than she would have
 taken the news that Manley was dead. He had no means of gauging the horror
 of a young woman who has all her life been familiar with such terms as
 "the demon rum," and who has been taught that "intemperance is the doorway
 to perdition"; a young woman whose life has been sheltered jealously from
 all contact with the ugly things of the world, and who believes that she
 might better die than marry a drunkard. He watched her unobtrusively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anyway, it was worrying over you that made him get off wrong to-day," he
 ventured at last, as a sort of palliative. "They say he was going to start
 home right in the face of the fire, and when they wouldn't let him, he
 headed straight for a saloon and commenced to pour whisky down him. He
 thought sure you?he thought the fire would?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see," Val interrupted stonily. "For the very doubtful honor of shaking
 the hand of a politician, he left me alone to face as best I might the
 possibility of burning alive; and when it seemed likely that the
 possibility had become a certainty, he must celebrate his bereavement by
 becoming a beast. Is that what you would have me believe of my husband?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's about the size of it," Kent admitted reluctantly. "Only I wouldn't
 have put it just that way, maybe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed! And how would you pit it, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent leaned harder against the door, and looked at her curiously. Women,
 it seemed to him, were always going to extremes; they were either too soft
 and meek, or else they were too hard and unmerciful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How would you put it? I am rather curious to know your point of view."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I know men better than you do, Mrs. Fleetwood. I know they can do
 some things that look pretty rotten on the surface, and yet be fairly
 decent underneath. You don't know how a habit like that gets a fellow just
 where he's weakest. Man ain't a beast. He's selfish and careless, and he
 gives way too easy, but he thinks the world of you. Jim says he cried like
 a baby when he came into the saloon, and acted like a crazy man. You don't
 want to be too hard on him. I've an idea this will learn him a lesson. If
 you take him the right way, Mrs. Fleetwood, the chances are he'll quit
 drinking."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val smiled. Kent thought he had never before seen a smile like that, and
 hoped he never would see another. There was in it neither mercy nor mirth,
 but only the hard judgment of a woman who does not understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you bring him to me here, Mr. Burnett? I do not feel quite equal to
 invading a saloon and begging him, on my knees, to come?after the
 conventional manner of drunkards' wives. But I should like to see him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent stared. "He ain't in any shape to argue with," he remonstrated. "You
 better wait a while."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rested her chin upon her hands, folded upon the high chair back, and
 gazed at him with her tawny eyes, that somehow reminded Kent of a lioness
 in a cage. He thought swiftly that a lioness would have as much mercy as
 she had in that mood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Burnett," she began quietly, when Kent's nerves were beginning to
 feel the strain of her silent stare, "I want to see Manley <i>as he is now</i>.
 I will tell you why. You aren't a woman, and you never will understand,
 but I shall tell you; I want to tell <i>somebody</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was raised well?that sounds queer, but modesty forbids more. At
 any rate, my mother was very careful about me. She believed in a girl
 marrying and becoming a good wife to a good man, and to that end she
 taught me and trained me. A woman must give her all?her life, her
 past, present, and future?to the man she marries. For three years I
 thought how unworthy I was to be Manley's wife. <i>Unworthy</i>, do you
 hear? I slept with his letters under my pillow." The self-contempt in her
 tone! "I studied the things I thought would make me a better companion out
 here in the wilderness. I practiced hours and hours every day upon my
 violin, because Manley had admired my playing, and I thought it would
 please him to have me play in the firelight on winter evenings, when the
 blizzards were howling about the house! I learned to cook, to wash
 clothes, to iron, to sweep, and to scrub, and to make my own clothes,
 because Manley's wife would live where she could not hire servants to do
 these things. I lived a beautiful, picturesque dream of domestic
 happiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I left my friends, my home, all the things I had been accustomed to all
 my life, and I came out here to live that dream!" She laughed bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can easily guess how much of it has come true, Mr. Burnett. But you
 don't know what it costs a girl to come down from the clouds and find that
 reality is hard and ugly?from dreaming of a cozy little nest of a
 home, and the love and care of?of Manley, to the reality?to
 carrying water and chopping wood and being left alone, day after day, and
 to find that his love only meant?Oh, you don't know how a woman
 clings to her ideals! You don't know how I have dung to mine. They have
 become rather tattered, and I have had to mend them often, but I have
 clung to them, even though they do not resemble much the dreams I brought
 with me to this horrible country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if it's true, what you tell me?if Manley himself is another
 disillusionment?if beyond his selfishness and his carelessness he is
 a drunken brute whom I can't even respect, then I'm done with my ideals. I
 want to see him just as he is. I want to see him once without the halo I
 have kept shining all these months. I've got my life to live?but I
 want to face facts and live facts. I can't go on dreaming and making
 believe, after this." She stopped and looked at him speculatively,
 absolutely without emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just before I left home," she went on in the same calm quiet, "a girl
 showed me some verses written by a very wicked man. At least, they say he
 is very wicked?at any rate, he is in jail. I thought the verses
 horrible and brutal; but now I think the man must be very wise. I remember
 a few lines, and they seem to me to mean Manley.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "For each man kills the thing he loves?
 Some do it with a bitter look,
 Some with a flattering word;
 The coward does it with a kiss,
 The brave man with a sword.
</pre>
 <p>
 "I don't remember all of it, but there was another line or two:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "The kindest use a knife, because
 The dead so soon grow cold.
</pre>
 <p>
 "I wish I had that poem now?I think I could understand it. I think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think you've got talking hysterics, if there is such a thing," Kent
 interrupted harshly. "You don't know half what you're saying. You've had a
 hard day, and you're all tired out, and everything looks outa focus. I
 know?I've seen men like that sometimes when some trouble hit 'em
 hard and unexpected. What you want is sleep; not poetry about killing
 people. A man, in the shape you are in, takes to whisky. You're taking to
 graveyard poetry?and, if you ask <i>me</i>, that's worse than
 whisky. You ain't normal. What you want to do is go straight to bed. When
 you wake up in the morning you won't feel so bad. You won't have half as
 many troubles as you've got now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knew you wouldn't understand it," Val remarked coldly, still staring at
 him with her chin on her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You won't yourself, to-morrow morning," Kent declared unsympathetically,
 and called Mrs. Hawley from the kitchen. "You better put Mrs. Fleetwood to
 bed," he advised gruffly. "And if you've got anything that'll make her
 sleep, give her a dose of it. She's so tired she can't see straight." He
 was nearly to the outside door when Val recovered her speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You men are all alike," she said contemptuously. "You give orders and you
 consider yourselves above all the laws of morality or decency; in reality
 you are beneath them. We shouldn't expect anything of the lower animals!
 How I <i>despise</i> men!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you're <i>talking</i>," grinned Kent, quite unmoved. "Whack us in a
 bunch all you like?but don't make one poor devil take it all. Men as
 a class are used to it and can stand it." He was laughing as he left the
 room, but his amusement lasted only until the door was closed behind him.
 "Lord!" he exclaimed, and drew a deep breath. "I'd sure hate to have that
 little woman say all them things about <i>me!</i>" and glanced
 involuntarily over his shoulder to where a crack of light showed under the
 faded green shade of one of the parlor windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He crossed the street and entered the saloon where Manley was still
 drinking heavily, his face crimson and blear-eyed and brutalized, his
 speech thickened disgustingly. He was sprawled in an armchair, waving an
 empty glass in an erratic attempt to mark the time of a college ditty six
 or seven years out of date, which he was trying to sing. He leered up at
 Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wife 'sall righ'," he informed him solemnly. "Knew she would be?fine
 guards's got out there. 'Sall righ'?somebody shaid sho. Have a
 drink."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent glowered down at him, made a swift, mental decision, and pipped him
 by the shoulder. "You come with me," he commanded. "I've got something
 important I want to tell you. Come on?if you can walk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Course I c'n walk all righ'. Shertainly I can walk. Wha's makes you
 think I can't walk? Want to inshult me? 'Sall my friends here?no
 secrets from my friends. Wha's want tell me? Shay it here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent was a big man; that is to say, he was tall, well-muscled and active.
 But so was Manley. Kent tried the power of persuasion, leaving force as a
 last, doubtful result. In fifteen minutes or thereabouts he had succeeded
 in getting Manley outside the door, and there he balked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wha's matter wish you?" he complained, pulling back. "C'm on back 'n'
 have drink. Wha's wanna tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wait. I'll tell you all about it in a minute. I've got something to
 show you, and I don't want the bunch to get next. Savvy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had a sickening sense that the subterfuge would not have deceived a
 five-year-old child, but it was accepted without question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He led Manley stumbling up the street, evading a direct statement as to
 his destination, pulled him off the board walk, and took him across a
 vacant lot well sprinkled with old shoes and tin cans. Here Manley fell
 down, and Kent's patience was well tested before he got him up and going
 again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where y' goin'?" Manley inquired pettishly, as often as he could bring
 his tongue to the labor of articulation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wait and I'll show you," was Kent's unvaried reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he pushed open a door and led his victim into the darkness of a
 small, windowless building. "It's in here?back against the wall,
 there," he said, pulling Manley after him. By feeling, and by a good sense
 of location, he arrived at a rough bunk built against the farther wall,
 with a blanket or two upon it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There you are," he announced grimly. "You'll have a sweet time getting
 anything to drink here, old boy. When you're sober enough to face your
 wife and have some show of squaring yourself with her, I'll come and let
 you out." He had pushed Manley down upon the bunk, and had reached the
 door before the other could get up and come at him. He pulled the door
 shut with a slam, slipped a padlock into the staple, and snapped it just
 before Manley lurched heavily against it. He was cursing as well as he
 could?was Manley, and he began kicking like an unruly child shut
 into a closet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, let up," Kent advised him, through a crack in the wall. "Want to know
 where you are? Well, you're in Hawley's ice house; you know it's a fine
 place for drunks to sober up in; it's awful popular for that purpose. Aw,
 you can't do any business kicking?that's been tried lots of times.
 This is sure well built, for an ice house. No, I can't let you out.
 Couldn't possibly, you know. I haven't got the key?old lady Hawley
 has got it, and she's gone to bed hours ago. You go to sleep and forget
 about it. I'll talk to you in the morning. Good night, and pleasant
 dreams!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The last thing Kent heard as he walked away was Manley's profane promise
 to cut Kent's heart out very early the next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The darned fool," Kent commented, as he stopped in the first patch of
 lamplight to roll a cigarette. "He ain't got another friend in town that'd
 go to the trouble I've gone to for him. He'll realize it, too, when all
 that whisky quits stewing inside him."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XII. A LESSON IN FORGIVENESS
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Well, old-timer, how you coming? You sure do sleep sound?this is
 the third time I've come to tell you breakfast is ready and then some.
 You'll get the bottom of the coffeepot, for fair, if you don't hustle."
 Kent left the door of the ice house wide open behind him, so that the
 warmth of mid-morning swept in to do battle with the chill and damp of wet
 sawdust and buried ice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley rolled over so that he faced his visitor, and his reply was abusive
 in the extreme. Kent waited, with an air of impersonal interest, until he
 was done and had turned his face away as though the subject was quite
 exhausted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now you've got that load off your mind, come on over and get a cup
 of coffee. But while you're thinking about whether you want anything but
 my heart's blood, I'm going to speak right up and tell you a few things
 that commonly ain't none of my business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know your wife came within an ace of burning to death yesterday?"
 Manley sat up with a jerk and glared at him. "Do you know you're burned
 out, slick and clean?all except the shack? Hay, stables, corral,
 wagons, chickens?" Kent spread his hands in a gesture including all
 minor details. "I rode over there when I saw the fire coming, and it's
 lucky I did, old-timer. I back-fired and saved the house?and your
 wife?from going up in smoke. But everything else went. Let that sink
 into your system, will you? And just see if you can draw a picture of what
 woulda happened if nobody had showed up?if that fire had hit the
 coulee with nobody there but your wife. Why, I run onto her half-way up
 the bluff, packing a wet sack, to fight it at the fire guards I Now, Man,
 it ain't any credit to, <i>you</i> that the worst didn't happen. I'd sure
 like to tell you what I think of a fellow that will leave a woman out
 there, twenty miles from town and ten from the nearest neighbor?and
 them not at home?to take a chance on a thing like that; but I can't.
 I never learned words enough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's another thing. Old lady Hawley took more interest in her than you
 did; she drove out there to see how about it, as soon as the fire had
 burned on past and left the trail safe. And it didn't look good to her?that
 little woman stuck out there all by herself. She made her pack up some
 clothes, and brought her to town with her. She didn't want to come; she
 had an idea that she ought to stay with it till you showed up. But the
 only original Hawley is sure all right! She talked your wife plumb outa
 the house and into the rig, and brought her to town. She's over to the
 hotel now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val at the hotel? How long has she been there?" Manley began smoothing
 his hair and his crumpled clothes with his hands, "Good heavens! You told
 her I'd gone on out, and had missed her on the trail, didn't you, Kent?
 She doesn't know I'm in town, does she? You always were a good fellow?I
 haven't forgotten how you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you can forget it now. I didn't tell her anything like that. I
 didn't think of it, for one thing. She knew all the time that you were in
 town. I'm tired of lying to her. I told her the truth. I told her you were
 drunk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley's jaw dropped. "You?you told her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ex-actly. I told her you were drunk." Kent nodded gravely, and his lips
 curled as he watched the other cringe. "She called me a liar," he added,
 with a certain reminiscent amusement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley brightened. "That's Val?once she believes in a person she's
 loyal as?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She ain't now," Kent interposed dryly. "When I let up she was plumb
 convinced. She knows now what ailed you the day she came and you didn't
 meet her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You dirty cur! And I thought you were a friend. You?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You thought right?until you got to rooting a little too deep in the
 mud, old-timer. And let me tell you something. I was your friend when I
 told her. She's got to know?you couldn't go on like this much longer
 without having her get wise; she ain't a fool. The thing for you to do now
 is to buck up and let her reform you. I've always heard that women are
 tickled plumb to death when they can reform a man. You go on over there
 and make your little talk, and then buckle down and live up to it. Savvy?
 That's your only chance now. It'll work, too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You <i>ought</i> to straighten up, Man, and act white! Not just to square
 yourself with her, but because you're going downhill pretty fast, if you
 only knew it. You ain't anything like you were two years ago, when we
 bached together. You've got to brace up pretty sudden, or you'll be so far
 gone you can't climb back. And when a man has got a wife to look after, it
 seems to me he ought to be the best it's in him to be. You were a fine
 fellow when you first hit the country?and she thought she was
 getting that same fine fellow when she came away out here to marry you. It
 ain't any of my business?but do you think you're giving her a square
 deal?" He waited a minute, and spoke the next sentence with a certain
 diffidence. "I'll gamble you haven't been disappointed in <i>her</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's an angel?and I'm a beast!" groaned Manley, with the
 exaggerated self-abasement which so frequently follows close upon the
 heels of intoxication. "She'll never forgive a thing like that?the
 best thing I can do is to blow my brains out!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like Walt. And have your picture enlarged and put in a gold frame, and
 hubby number two learning his morals from your awful example," elaborated
 Kent, in much the same tone he had employed when Val, only the day before,
 had rashly expressed a wish for a speedy death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley sat up straighter and sent a look of resentment toward the man who
 bantered when he should have sympathized. "It's all a big joke with you,
 of course," he flared weakly. "You're not married?to a perfect
 woman; a woman who never did anything wrong in her life, and can't
 understand how anybody should want to, and can't forgive him when he does.
 She expects a man to be a saint. Why, I don't even smoke in the house?and
 she doesn't dream I'd ever swear, under any circumstances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Kent, a fellow's <i>got</i> to go to town and turn himself loose
 sometimes, when he lives in a rarified atmosphere of refined morality, and
 listens to Songs Without Words and weepy classics on the violin, and never
 a thing to make your feet tingle. She doesn't believe in public dances,
 either. Nor cards. She reads 'The Ring and the Book' evenings, and wants
 to discuss it and read passages of it to me. I used to take some interest
 in those things, and she doesn't seem to see I've changed. Why, hang it,
 Kent, Cold Spring Coulee's no place for Browning?he doesn't fit in.
 All that sort of thing is a thousand miles behind me?and I've got to?"
 He stopped short and brooded, his eyes upon the dank sawdust at his feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm a beast," he repeated rather lugubriously. "She's an angel?an
 Eastern-bred angel. And let me tell you, Kent, all that's pretty hard to
 live up to!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent looked down at him meditatively, wondering if there was not a good
 deal of truth and justice in Manley's argument. But his sympathies had
 already gone to the other side, and Kent was not the man to make an
 emotional pendulum of himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what you going to do about it?" he asked, after a short silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer Manley rose to his feet with a certain air of determination,
 which flamed up oddly above his general weakness, like the last sputter of
 a candle burned down. "I'm going over and take my medicine?face the
 music," he said almost sullenly, "She's too good for me?I always
 knew it. And I haven't treated her right?I've left her out there
 alone too much. But she wouldn't come to town with me?she said she
 couldn't endure the sight of it. What could I do? <i>I</i> couldn't stay
 out there all the time; there were times when I had to come. She didn't
 seem to mind staying alone. She never objected. She was always sweet sad
 good-natured?and shut up inside of herself. She just gives you what
 she pleases of her mind, and the rest she hides?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent laughed suddenly. "You married men sure do have all kinds of
 trouble," he remarked. "A fellow like me can go on a jamboree any time he
 likes, and as long as he likes, and it don't concern anybody but himself?and
 maybe the man he's working for; and look at you, scared plumb silly
 thinking of what your wife's going to say about it. If you ask me, I'm
 going to trot alone; I'd rather be lonesome than good, any old time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That, however, did not tend to raise Manley's spirits any. He entered the
 hotel with visible reluctance, looked into the parlor, and heaved a sigh
 of relief when he saw that it was empty, wavered at the foot of the steep,
 narrow stairs, and retreated to the dining room, with Kent at his heels
 knowing that the matter had passed quite beyond his help or hindrance and
 had entered that mysterious realm of matrimony where no unwedded man or
 woman may follow and yet is curious enough to linger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just inside the door Manley stopped so suddenly that Kent bumped against
 him. Val, sweet and calm and cool, was sitting just where the smoke-dimmed
 sunlight poured in through a window upon her, and a breeze came with it
 and stirred her hair. She had those purple shadows under her eyes which
 betray us after long, sleepless hours when we live with our troubles and
 the world dreams around us; she had no color at all in her cheeks, and she
 had that aloofness of manner which Manley, in his outburst, had described
 as being shut up inside herself. She glanced up at them, just as she would
 have done had they both been strangers, and went on sugaring her coffee
 with a dainty exactness which, under the circumstances, seemed altogether
 too elaborate to be unconscious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good morning," she greeted them quietly. "I think we must be the laziest
 people in town; at any rate, we seem to be the latest risers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent stared at her frankly, so that she flushed a little under the
 scrutiny. Manley consciously avoided looking at her, and muttered
 something unintelligible while he pulled out a chair three places distant
 from her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stole a sidelong, measuring look at her husband while she took a sip
 of coffee, and then her eyes turned upon Kent. More than ever, it seemed
 to him, they resembled the eyes of a lioness watching you quietly from the
 corner of her cage. You could look at them, but you could not look into
 them. Always they met your gaze with a baffling veil of inscrutability.
 But they were darker than the eyes of a lioness; they were human eyes;
 woman eyes?alluring eyes. She did not say a word, and, after a brief
 stare which might have meant almost anything, she turned to her plate of
 toast and broke away the burned edges of a slice and nibbled at the
 passable center as if she had no trouble beyond a rather unsatisfactory
 breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was foolish, it was childish for three people who knew one another very
 well, to sit and pretend to eat, and to speak no word; so Kent thought,
 and tried to break the silence with some remark which would not sound
 constrained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's going to storm," he flung into the silence, like chucking a rock
 into a pond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think so?" Val asked languidly, just grazing him with a glance, in
 that inattentive way she sometimes had. "Are you going out home?or
 to what's left of it?to-day, Manley?" She did not look at him at
 all, Kent observed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know?I'll have to hire a team?I'll see what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Hawley thinks we ought to stay here for a few days?or that I
 ought?while you make arrangements for building a new stable, and all
 that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you want to stay," Manley agreed rather eagerly, "why, of course, you
 can. There's nothing out there to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it doesn't matter in the slightest degree where I stay. I only
 mentioned it because I promised her I would speak to you about it." There
 was more than languor in her tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're going to start the fireworks pretty quick," Kent mentally
 diagnosed the situation and rose hurriedly. "Well, I've got to hunt a
 horse, myself, and pull out for the Wishbone," he explained gratuitously.
 "Ought to've gone last night. Good-bye." He closed the door behind him and
 shrugged his shoulders. "Now they can fight it out," he told himself.
 "Glad <i>I</i> ain't a married man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, they did not fight it out then. Kent had no more than reached the
 office when Val rose, hoped that Manley would please excuse her, and left
 the room also. Manley heard her go up-stairs, found out from Arline what
 was the number of Val's room, and followed her. The door was locked, but
 when he rapped upon it Val opened it an inch and held it so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val, let me in. I want to talk with you. I?God knows how sorry I am?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If He does, that ought to be sufficient," she answered coldly. "I don't
 feel like talking now?especially upon the subject you would choose.
 You're a man, supposedly. You must know what it is your duty to do. Please
 let us not discuss it?now or ever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Val?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to talk about it, I tell you! I won't?I <i>can't</i>.
 You must do without the conventional confession and absolution. You must
 have some sort of conscience?let that receive your penitence." She
 started to close the door, but he caught it with his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val?do you hate me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at him for a moment, as if she were trying to decide. "No," she
 said at last, "I don't think I do; I'm quite sure that I do not. But I'm
 terribly hurt and disappointed." She closed the door then and turned the
 key.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley stood for a moment rather blankly before it, then put his hands as
 deep in his pockets as they would go, and went slowly down the stairs. At
 that moment he did not feel particularly penitent. She would not listen to
 "the conventional confession!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That girl can be hard as nails!" he muttered, under his breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went into the office, got a cigar, and lighted it moodily. He glanced
 at the bottles ranged upon the shelves behind the bar, drew in his breath
 for speech, let it go in a sigh, and walked out. He knew perfectly well
 what Val had meant. She had deliberately thrown him back upon his own
 strength. He had fallen by himself, he must pick himself up; and she would
 stand back and watch the struggle, and judge him according to his failure
 or his success. He had a dim sense that it was a dangerous experiment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked for Kent, found him just as he was mounting at the stables, and
 let him go almost without a word. After all, no one could help him. He
 stood there smoking after Kent had gone, and when his cigar was finished
 he wandered back to the hotel. As was always the case after hard drinking,
 he had a splitting headache. He got a room as close to Val's as he could,
 shut himself into it, and gave himself up to his headache and to gloomy
 meditation. All day he lay upon the bed, and part of the time he slept. At
 supper time he rapped upon Val's door, got no answer, and went down alone,
 to find her in the dining room. There was an empty chair beside her, and
 he took it as his right. She talked a little?about the fire and the
 damage it had done. She said she was worried because she had forgotten to
 bring the cat, and what would it find to eat out there?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything's burned perfectly black for miles and miles, you know," she
 reminded him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They left the room together, and he followed her upstairs and to her door.
 This time she did not shut him out, and he went in and sat down by the
 window, and looked out upon the meager little street. Never, in the years
 he had known her, had she been so far from him. He watched her covertly
 while she searched for something in her suit case.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid I didn't bring enough clothes to last more than a day or two,"
 she remarked. "I couldn't seem to think of anything that night. Arline did
 most of the packing for me. I'm afraid I misjudged that woman, Manley;
 there's a good deal to her, after all. But she <i>is</i> funny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Val, I want to tell you I'm going to?to be different. I've been a
 beast, but I'm going to?" So much he had rushed out before she could
 freeze him to silence again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope so," she cut in, as he hesitated, "That is something you must
 judge for yourself, and do by yourself. Do you think you will be able to
 get a team tomorrow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?to hell with a team!" Manley exploded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val dropped her hairbrush upon the floor. "Manley Fleetwood! Has it come
 to that, also? Isn't it enough to?" She choked. "Manley, you can be
 a?a drunken sot, if you choose?I've no power to prevent you;
 but you shall not swear in my presence. I thought you had some of the
 instincts of a gentleman, but?" She set her teeth hard together. She
 was white around the mouth, and her whole, slim body was aquiver with
 outraged dignity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was something queer in Manley's eyes as he looked at her, the length
 of the tiny room between them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I beg your pardon. I remember, now, your Fern Hill ethics. I may <i>go</i>
 to hell, for all of you?you will simply hold back your immaculate,
 moral skirts so that I may pass without smirching them; but I must not
 mention my destination?that is so unrefined!" He got up from the
 chair, with a laugh that was almost a snort. "You refuse to discuss a
 certain subject, though it's almost a matter of life and death with me; at
 least, it was. Your happiness and my own was at stake, I thought. But it's
 all right?I needn't have worried about it. I still have some of the
 instincts of a gentleman, and your pure ears shall not be offended by any
 profanity or any disagreeable 'conventional confessions.' The absolution,
 let me say, I expected to do without." He started, full of some secret
 intent, for the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val humanized suddenly. By the time his fingers touched the door knob she
 had read his purpose, had readied his side, and was clutching his arm with
 both her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley Fleetwood, what are you going to do?" She was actually panting
 with the jump of her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned the knob, so that the latch clicked. "Get drunk. Be the drunken
 sot you expect me to be. Go to that vulgar place which I must not mention
 in your presence. Let go my arm, Val."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was all woman, then. She pulled him away from the door and the unnamed
 horror which lay outside. She was not the crying sort, but she cried, just
 the same?heartbrokenly, her head against his shoulder, as if she
 herself were the sinner. She clung to him, she begged him to forgive her
 hardness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She learned something which every woman must learn if she would keep a
 little happiness in her life: she learned how to forgive the man she
 loved, and to trust him afterward.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIII. ARLINE GIVES A DANCE
 </h2>
 <p>
 A house, it would seem, is almost the least important part of a ranch; one
 can camp, with frying pan and blankets, in the shade of a bush or the
 shelter of canvas. But to do anything upon a ranch, one must have many
 things?burnable things, for the most part, as Manley was to learn by
 experience when he left Val at the hotel and rode out, the next day, to
 Cold Spring Coulee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To ride over twenty miles of blackness is depressing enough in itself, but
 to find, at the end of the journey, that one's work has all gone for
 nothing, and one's money and one's plans and hopes, is worse than
 depressing. Manley sat upon his horse and gazed rather blankly at the heap
 of black cinders that had been his haystacks, and at the cold embers where
 had stood his stables, and at the warped bits of iron that had been his
 buckboard, his wagon, his rake and mower?all the things he had
 gathered around him in the three years he had spent upon the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The house merely emphasized his loss. He got down, picked up the cat,
 which was mewing plaintively beside his horse, snuggled it into his arm,
 and remounted. Val had told him to be sure and find the cat, and bring it
 back with him. His horses and his cattle?not many, to be sure, in
 that land of large holdings?were scattered, and it would take the
 round-up to gather them together again. So the cat, and the horse he rode,
 the bleak coulee, and the unattractive little house with its three rooms
 and its meager porch, were all that he could visualize as his worldly
 possessions. And when he thought of his bank account he winced mentally.
 Before snow fell he would be debt-ridden, the best he could do. For he
 must have a stable, and corral, and hay, and a wagon, and?he refused
 to remind himself of all the things he must have if he would stay on the
 ranch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His was not a strong nature at best, and now he shrank from facing his
 misfortune and wanted only to get away from the place. He loped his horse
 half-way up the hill, which was not merciful riding. The half-starved cat
 yowled in his arms, and struck her claws through his coat till he felt the
 prick of them, and he swore; at the cat, nominally, but really at the
 trick fate had played upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a week he dallied in town, without heart or courage though Val urged
 him to buy lumber and build, and cheered him as best she could. He did
 make a half-hearted attempt to get lumber to the place, but there seemed
 to be no team in town which he could hire. Every one was busy, and put him
 off. He tried to buy hay of Blumenthall, of the Wishbone, of every man he
 met who had hay. No one had any hay to sell, however. Blumenthall
 complained that he was short, himself, and would buy if he could, rather
 than sell. The Wishbone foreman declared profanely?that hay was
 going to be worth a dollar a pound to <i>them</i>, before spring. They
 were all sorry for Manley, and told him he was "sure playing tough luck,"
 but they couldn't sell any hay, that was certain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But we must manage somehow to fix the place so we can live on it this
 winter," Val would insist, when he told her how every move seemed blocked.
 "You're very brave, dear, and I'm proud of the way you are holding out?but
 Hope is not a good place for you. It would be foolish to stay in town.
 Can't you buy enough hay here in town?baled hay from the store?to
 keep our horses through the winter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I tried," Manley responded gloomily. "But Brinberg is nearly out.
 He's expecting a carload in, but it hasn't come yet. He said he'd let me
 know when it gets here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile the days slipped away, and imperceptibly the heat and haze of
 the fires gave place to bright sunlight and chill winds, and then to the
 chill winds without the sunshine. One morning the ground was frozen hard,
 and all the roofs gleamed white with the heavy frost. Arline bestirred
 herself, and had a heating stove set up in the parlor, and Val went down
 to the dry heat and the peculiar odor of a rusted stove in the flush of
 its first fire since spring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day, as she sat by her window up-stairs, she looked out at the
 first nip of winter. A few great snowflakes drifted down from the slaty
 sky; a puff of wind sent them dancing down the street, shook more down,
 and whirled them giddily. Then the storm came and swept through the little
 street and whined lonesomely around the hotel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Over at the saloon?"Pop's Place," it proclaimed itself in washed-out
 lettering?three tied horses circled uneasily until they were
 standing back to the storm, their bodies hunched together with the chill
 of it, their tails whipping between their legs. They accentuated the blank
 dreariness of the empty street. The snow was whitening their rumps and
 clinging, in tiny drifts, upon the saddle skirts behind the cantles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the little hollows of the rough, frozen ground were filling slowly,
 making white patches against the brown of the earth?patches which
 widened and widened until they met, and the whole street was blanketed
 with fresh, untrodden snow. Val shivered suddenly, and hurried down-stairs
 where the air was warm and all a-steam with cooking, and the odor of
 frying onions smote the nostrils like a blow in the face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose we must stay here, now, till the storm is over," she sighed,
 when she met Manley at dinner. "But as soon as it clears we must go back
 to the ranch. I simply cannot endure another week of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're gitting uneasy?I seen that, two or three days ago," said
 Arline, who had come into the dining room with a tray of meat and
 vegetables, and overheard her. "You want to stay, now, till after the
 dance. There's going to be a dance Friday night, you know?everybody's
 coming. You got to wait for that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't attend public dances," Val stated calmly. "I am going home as
 soon as the storm clears?if Manley can buy a little hay, and find
 our horses, and get some sort of a driving vehicle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if he can't, maybe he can round up a <i>ridin'</i> vee-hicle,"
 Arline remarked dryly, placing the meat before Manley, the potatoes before
 Val, and the gravy exactly between the two, with mathematical precision.
 "I'm givin' that dance myself. You'll have to go?I'm givin' it in
 your honor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In?my?why, the <i>idea!</i> It's good of you, but?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you're goin', and you're goin' to take your vi'lin over and play us
 some pieces. I tucked it into the rig and brought it in, on purpose. I
 planned out the hull thing, driving out to your place. In case you wasn't
 all burned up, I made up my mind I was going to give you a dance, and git
 you acquainted with folks. You needn't to hang back?I've told
 everybody it was in your honor, and that you played the vi'lin swell, and
 we'd have some real music. And I've sent to Chinook for the dance music?harp,
 two fiddles, and a coronet?and you ain't going to stall the hull
 thing now. I didn't mean to tell you till the last minute, but you've got
 to have time to mate up your mind you'll go to a public dance for oncet in
 your life. It ain't going to hurt you none. I've went, ever sence I was
 big enough to reach up and grab holt of my pardner?and I'm every bit
 as virtuous as you be. You're going, and you'n Man are going to head the
 grand march."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val's face was flushed, her lips pursed, and her eyes wide. Plainly she
 was not quite sure whether she was angry, amused, or insulted. She
 descended straight to a purely feminine objection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I haven't a thing to wear, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, you have. While you was dillydallying out in the front room,
 that night, wondering whether you'd have hysterics, or faint, or what all,
 I dug deep in that biggest trunk of yourn, and fished up one of your party
 dresses?white satin, it is, with embroid'ry all up 'n' down the
 front, and slimpsy lace; it's kinda low-'n'-behold?one of them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My white satin?why, Mrs. Hawley! That?you must have brought
 the gown I wore to my farewell club reception. It has a train, and?why,
 the <i>idea!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can cut off the trail?you got plenty of time?or you can
 pin it up. I didn't have time that night to see how the thing was made,
 and I took it because I found white skirts and stockin's, and white satin
 slippers to go with it, right handy. You're a bride, and white'll be
 suitable, and the dance is in your honor. Wear it just as it is, fer all
 me. Show the folks what real clothes look like. I never seen a woman
 dressed up that way in my hull life. You wear it, Val, trail 'n' all. I'll
 back you up in it, and tell folks it's my idee, and not yourn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not in the habit of apologizing to people for the clothes I wear."
 Val lifted her chin haughtily. "I am not at all sure that I shall go. In
 fact, I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you'll go!" Arline rested her arms upon her bony hips and snapped her
 meager jaws together. "You'll go, if I have to carry you over. I've sent
 for fifteen yards of buntin' to decorate the hall with. I ain't going to
 all that trouble for nothing. I ain't giving a dance in honor of a certain
 person, and then let that person stay away. You?why, you'd queer
 yourself with the hull country, Val Fleetwood! You ain't got the least
 sign of an excuse You got the clothes, and you ain't sick. There's a
 reason why you got to show up. I ain't going into no details at present,
 but under the circumstances, it's <i>advisable</i>." She smelled something
 burning then, and bolted for the kitchen, where her sharp, rather nasal
 voice was heard upbraiding Minnie for some neglect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp Jenks came in, eyed Val and Manley from under one lifted,
 eyebrow, smiled skinnily, and pulled out a chair with a rasping noise, and
 sat down facing them. Instinctively Val refrained from speaking her mind
 about Arline and her dance before Polycarp, but afterward, in their own
 room, she grew rather eloquent upon the subject. She would not go. She
 would not permit that woman to browbeat her into doing what she did not
 want to do, she said. In her honor, indeed! The impertinence of going to
 the bottom of her trunk, and meddling with her clothes?with that
 reception gown, of all others! The idea of wearing that gown to a frontier
 dance?even if she consented to go to such a dance! And expecting her
 to amuse the company by playing "pieces" on the violin!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, why not?" Manley was sitting rather apathetically upon the edge of
 the bed, his arms resting upon his knees, his eyes moodily studying the
 intricate rose pattern in the faded Brussels carpet. They were the first
 words he had spoken; one might easily have doubted whether he had heard
 all Val said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not? Manley Fleetwood, do you mean to tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not go, and get acquainted, and quit feeling that you're a pearl cast
 among swine? It strikes me the Hawley person is pretty level-headed on the
 subject. If you're going to live in this country, why not quit thinking
 how out of place you are, and how superior, and meet us all on a level? It
 won't hurt you to go to that dance, and it won't hurt you to play for
 them, if they want you to. You <i>can</i> play, you know; you used to play
 at all the musical doings in Fern Hill, and even in the city sometimes.
 And, let me tell you, Val, we aren't quite savages, out here. I've even
 suspected, sometimes, that we're just as good as Fern Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We?" Val looked at him steadily. "So you wish to identify yourself with
 these people?with Polycarp Jenks, and Arline Hawley, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not? They're shaky on grammar, and their manners could stand a little
 polish, but aside from that they're exactly like the people you've lived
 among all your life. Sure, I wish to identify myself with them. I'm just a
 rancher?pretty small punkins, too, among all these big outfits, and
 you're a rancher's wife. The Hawley person could buy us out for cash
 to-morrow, if she wanted to, and never miss the money. And, Val, she's
 giving that dance in your honor; you ought to appreciate that. The Hawley
 doesn't take a fancy to every woman she sees?and, let me tell you,
 she stands ace-high in this country. If she didn't like you, she could
 make you wish she did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, upon my word! I begin to suspect you of being a humorist, Manley.
 And even if you mean that seriously?why, it's all the funnier." To
 prove it, she laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley hesitated, then left the room with a snort, a scowl, and a slam of
 the door; and the sound of Val's laughter followed him down the stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline came up, her arms full of white satin, white lace, white cambric,
 and the toes of two white satin slippers showing just above the top of her
 apron pockets. She walked briskly in and deposited her burden upon the
 bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My! them's the nicest smellin' things I ever had a hold of," she
 observed. "And still they don't seem to smell, either. Must be a dandy
 perfumery you've got. I brought up the things, seein' you know they're
 here. I thought you could take your time about cuttin' off the trail and
 fillin' in the neck and sleeves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down upon the foot of the bed, carefully tucking her gingham apron
 close about her so that it might not come in contact with the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never did see such clothes," she sighed. "I dunno how you'll ever git a
 chancet to wear 'em out in this country?seems to me they're most too
 pretty to wear, anyhow, I can git Marthy Winters to come over and help you?she
 does sewin'?and you can use my machine any time you want to. I'd
 take a hold myself if I didn't have all the baking to do for the dance.
 That Min can't learn nothing, seems like. I can't trust her to do a thing,
 hardly, unless I stand right over her. Breed girls ain't much account
 ever; but they're all that'll work out, in this country, seems like.
 Sometimes I swear I'll git a Chink and be done with it?only I got to
 have somebody I can talk to oncet in a while. I couldn't never talk to a
 Chink?they don't seem hardly human to me. Do they to you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And say! I've got some allover lace?it's eecrue?that you can
 fill in the neck with; you're welcome to use it?there's most a yard
 of it, and I won't never find a use for it. Or I was thinkin', there'll be
 enough cut off'n the trail to make a gamp of the satin, sleeves and all."
 She lifted the shining stuff with manifest awe. "It does seem a shame to
 put the shears to it?but you never'll git any wear out of it the way
 it is, and I don't believe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mis' <i>Hawley!</i>" shrilled the voice of Minnie at the foot of the
 stairs. "There's a couple of <i>drummers</i> off'n the <i>train</i>, 'n'
 they want <i>supper</i>, 'n' what'll I <i>give</i> 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My heavens! That girl'll drive me crazy, sure!" Arline hurried to the
 door. "Don't take the roof off'n the house," she cried querulously down
 the stairway. "I'm comin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val had not spoken a word. She went over to the bed, lifted a fold of
 satin, and smiled down at it ironically. "Mamma and I spent a whole month
 planning and sewing and gloating over you," she said aloud. "You were
 almost as important as a wedding gown; the club's farewell reception?'To
 what base uses we do?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, here's your slippers!" Arline thrust half her body into the room and
 held the slippers out to Val. "I stuck 'em into my pockets to bring up,
 and forgot all about 'em, mind you, till I was handin' the drummers their
 tea. And one of 'em happened to notice 'em, and raised right up outa his
 chair, an' said: 'Cind'rilla, sure as I live! Say, if there's a foot in
 this town that'll go into them slippers, for God's sake introduce me to
 the owner!' I told him to mind his own business. Drummers do get awful
 fresh when they think they can get away with it." She departed in a hurry,
 as usual.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every day after that Arline talked about altering the satin gown. Every
 day Val was noncommittal and unenthusiastic. Occasionally she told Arline
 that she was not going to the dance, but Arline declined to take seriously
 so preposterous a declaration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You want to break a leg, then," she told Val grimly on Thursday. "That's
 the only excuse that'll go down with this bunch. And you better git a move
 on?it comes off to-morrer night, remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't go, Manley!" Val consoled herself by declaring, again and again.
 "The idea of Arline Hawley ordering me about like a child! Why should I go
 if I don't care to go?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Search me." Manley shrugged his shoulders. "It isn't so long, though,
 since you were just as determined to stay and have the shivaree, you
 remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you and Mr. Burnett tried to do exactly what Arline is doing. You
 seemed to think I was a child, to be ordered about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the very last minute?to be explicit, an hour before the hall was
 lighted, several hours after smoke first began to rise from the chimney,
 Val suddenly swerved to a reckless mood. Arline had gone to her own room
 to dress, too angry to speak what was in her mind. She had worked since
 five o'clock that morning. She had bullied Val, she had argued, she had
 begged, she had wheedled. Val would not go. Arline had appealed to Manley,
 and Manley had assured her, with a suspicious slurring of his <i>esses</i>
 that he was out of it, and had nothing to say. Val, he said, could not be
 driven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was after Arline had gone to her room and Manley had returned to the
 "office" that Val suddenly picked up her hairbrush and, with an impish
 light in her eyes, began to pile her hair high upon her head. With her
 lips curved to match the mockery of her eyes, she began hurriedly to
 dress. Later, she went down to the parlor, where four women from the
 neighboring ranches were sitting stiffly and in constrained silence,
 waiting to be escorted to the hall. She swept in upon them, a glorious,
 shimmery creature all in white and gold. The women steed, wavered, and
 looked away?at the wall, the floor, at anything but Val's bare,
 white shoulders and arms as white. Arline had forgotten to look for
 gloves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val read the consternation in their weather-tanned faces, and smiled in
 wicked enjoyment. She would shock all of Hope; she would shock even
 Arline, who had insisted upon this. Like a child in mischief, she turned
 and went rustling down the ball to the dining room. She wanted to show
 Arline. She had not thought of the possibility of finding any one but
 Arline and Minnie there, so that she was taken slightly aback when she
 discovered Kent and another man eating a belated supper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent looked up, eyed her sharply for just an instant, and smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good evening, Mrs. Fleetwood," he said calmly. "Ready for the ball, I
 see. We got in late." He went on spreading butter upon his bread,
 evidently quite unimpressed by her magnificence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other man stared fixedly at his plate. It was a trifle, but Val
 suddenly felt foolish and ashamed. She took a step or two toward the
 kitchen, then retreated; down the hall she went, up the stairs and into
 her own room, the door of which she shut and locked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such a fool!" she whispered vehemently, and stamped her white-shod foot
 upon the carpet. "He looked perfectly disgusted?and so did that
 other man. And no wonder. Such?it's <i>vulgar</i>, Val Fleetwood!
 It's just ill-bred, and coarse, and horrid!" She threw herself upon the
 bed and put her face in the pillow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some one?she thought it sounded like Manley?came up and tried
 the door, stood a moment before it, and went away again. Arline's voice,
 sharpened with displeasure, she heard speaking to Minnie upon the stairs.
 They went down, and there was a confusion of voices below. In the street
 beneath her window footsteps sounded intermittently, coming and going with
 a certain eagerness of tread. After a time there came, from a distance,
 the sound of violins and the "coronet" of which Arline had been so proud;
 and mingled with it was an undercurrent of shuffling feet, a mere whisper
 of sound, cut sharply now and then by the sharp commands of the floor
 manager. They were dancing?in her honor. And she was a fool; a
 proud, ill-tempered, selfish fool..
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With one of her quick changes of mood she rose, patted her hair smooth,
 caught up a wrap oddly inharmonious with the gown and slippers, looped her
 train over her arm, tool her violin, and ran lightly down-stairs. The
 parlor, the dining room, the kitchen were deserted and the lights turned
 low. She braced herself mentally, and, flushing at the unaccustomed act,
 rapped timidly upon the door which opened into the office?which by
 that time she knew was really a saloon. Hawley himself opened the door,
 and in his eyes bulged at sight of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Mr. Fleetwood here? I?I thought, after all, I'd go to the
 dance," she said, in rather a timid voice, shrinking back into the shadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fleetwood? Why, I guess he's gone on over. He said you wasn't going. You
 wait a minute. I?here, Kent! You take Mrs. Fleetwood over to the
 hall. Man's gone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no! I?really, it doesn't matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Kent had already thrown away his cigarette and come out to her,
 closing the door immediately after him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll take you over?I was just going, anyway," He assured her, his
 eyes dwelling upon her rather intently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?I wanted Manley. I?I hate to go?like this, it seems
 so?so queer, in this place. At first I?I thought it would be a
 joke, but it isn't; it's silly and,?and ill-bred. You?everybody
 will be shocked, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent took a step toward her, where she was shrinking against the stairway.
 Once before she had lost her calm composure and had let him peep into her
 mind. Then it had been on account of Manley; now, womanlike, it was her
 clothes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You couldn't be anything but all right, if you tried," he told her,
 speaking softly. "It isn't silly to look the way the Lord meant you to
 look. You?you?oh, you needn't worry?nobody's going to be
 shocked very hard." He reached out and took the violin from her; took also
 her arm and opened the outer door. "You're late," he said, speaking in a
 more commonplace tone. "You ought to have overshoes, or something?those
 white slippers won't be so white time you get there. Maybe I ought to
 carry you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The idea!" she stepped out daintily upon the slushy walk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I can take you a block or two around, and have sidewalk all the
 way; that'll help some. Women sure are a lot of bother?I'm plumb
 sorry for the poor devils that get inveigled into marrying one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mr. Burnett! Do you always talk like that? Because if you do, I
 don't wonder?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," Kent interrupted, looking down at her and smiling grimly, "as it
 happens, I don't. I'm real nice, generally speaking. Say! this is going to
 be a good deal of trouble, do you know? After you dance with hubby, you've
 got to waltz with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Got</i> to?" Val raised her eyebrows, though the expression was lost
 upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. Look at the way I worked like a horse, saving your life?and
 the cat's?and now leading you all over town to keep those nice white
 slippers clean! By rights, you oughtn't to dance with anybody else. But I
 ain't looking for real gratitude. Four or five waltzes is all I'll insist
 on, but?" His tone was lugubrious in the extreme.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll waltz with you once?for saving the cat; and once for
 saving the slippers. For saving me, I'm not sure that I thank you." Val
 stepped carefully over a muddy spot on the walk. "Mr. Burnett, you?really,
 you're an awfully queer man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent walked to the next crossing and helped her over it before he answered
 her. "Yes," he admitted soberly then, "I reckon you're right. I am?queer."
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIV. A WEDDING PRESENT
 </h2>
 <p>
 Sunday it was, and Val had insisted stubbornly upon going back to the
 ranch; somewhat to her surprise, if one might judge by her face, Arline
 Hawley no longer demurred, but put up lunch enough for a week almost, and
 announced that she was going along. Hank would have to drive out, to bring
 back the team, and she said she needed a rest, after all the work and
 worry of that dance. Manley, upon whose account it was that Val was so
 anxious, seemed to have nothing whatever to say about it. He was sullenly
 acquiescent?as was perhaps to be expected of a man who had slipped
 into his old habits and despised himself for doing so, and almost hated
 his wife because she had discovered it and said nothing. Val was thankful,
 during that long, bleak ride over the prairie, for Arline's incessant
 chatter. It was better than silence, when the silence means bitter
 thoughts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," said Arline, moving excitedly in her seat when they neared Cold
 Spring Coulee, "maybe I better tell you that the folks round here has
 kinda planned a little su'prise for you. They don't make much of a showin'
 about bein' neighborly?not when things go smooth?but they're
 right there when trouble comes. It's jest a little weddin' present?and
 if it comes kinda late in the day, why, you don't want to mind that. My
 dance that I gave was a weddin' party, too, if you care to call it that.
 Anyway, it was to raise the money to pay for our present, as far as it
 went?and I want to tell you right now, Val, that you was sure the
 queen of the ball; everybody said you looked jest like a queen in a
 picture, and I never heard a word ag'inst your low-neck dress. It looked
 all right on <i>you</i>, don't you see? On me, for instance, it woulda
 been something fierce. And I'm real glad you took a hold and danced like
 you did, and never passed nobody up, like some woulda done. You'll be glad
 you did, now you know what it was for. Even danced with Polycarp Jenks?and
 there ain't hardly any woman but what'll turn <i>him</i> down; I'll bet he
 tromped all over your toes, didn't he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes," Val admitted. "What about the surprise you were speaking of,
 Mrs. Hawley?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It does seem as if you might call me Arline," she complained
 irrelevantly. "We're comin' to that?don't you worry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it?a piano?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My lands, no! You don't need a fiddle and a piano both, do you? Man,
 what'd you rather have for a weddin' present?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, upon the front seat beside Hank, gave his shoulders an impatient
 twitch. "Fifty thousand dollars," he replied glumly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm glad you're real modest about it," Arline retorted sharply. She was
 beginning to tell herself quite frequently that she "didn't have no time
 for Man Fleetwood, seeing he wouldn't brace up and quit drinkin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val's lips curled as she looked at Manley's back. "What I should like,"
 she said distinctly, "is a great, big pile of wood, all cut and ready for
 the stove, and water pails that never would go empty. It's astonishing how
 one's desires eventually narrow down to bare essentials, isn't it? But as
 we near the place, I find those two things more desirable than a piano!"
 Then she bit her lip angrily because she had permitted herself to give the
 thrust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you poor thing! Man Fleetwood, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val impulsively caught her by the arm. "Oh, hush! I was only joking," she
 said hastily. "I was trying to balance Manley's wish for fifty thousand
 dollars, don't you see? It was stupid of me, I know." She laughed
 unconvincingly. "Let me guess what the surprise is. First, is it large or
 small?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kinda big," tittered Arline, falling into the spirit of the joke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bigger than a?wait, now. A sewing machine?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline covered her mouth with her hand and nodded dumbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You say all the neighbors gave it and the dance helped pay for it?let
 me see. Could it possibly be?what in the world could it be? Manley,
 help me guess! Is it something useful, or just something nice?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Useful," said Arline, and snapped her jaws together as if she feared to
 let another word loose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Larger than a sewing machine, and useful." Val puckered her brows over
 the puzzle. "And all the neighbors gave it. Do you know, I've been
 thinking all sorts of nasty things about our poor neighbors, because they
 refused to sell Manley any hay. And all the while they were planning this
 sur?" She never finished that sentence, or the word, even.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With a jolt over a rock, and a sharp turn to the right, Hank had brought
 them to the very brow of the hill, where they could look down into the
 coulee, and upon the house standing in its tiny, unkempt yard, just beyond
 the sparse growth of bushes which marked the spring creek. Involuntarily
 every head turned that way, and every pair of eyes looked downward. Hank
 chirped to the horses, threw all his weight upon the brake, and they
 rattled down the grade, the brake block squealing against the rear wheels.
 They were half-way down before any one spoke. It was Val, and she almost
 whispered one word:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline's eyes were wet, and there was a croak in her voice when she cried
 jubilantly: "Well, ain't that better 'n a sewin' machine?or a
 piano?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Val did not attempt an answer. She was staring?staring as if she
 could not convince herself of the reality. Even Manley was jarred out of
 his gloomy meditations, and half rose in the seat that he might see over
 Hank's shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what your neighbors have done," Arline began eagerly, "and they
 nearly busted tryin' to git through in time, and to keep it a dead secret.
 They worked like whiteheads, lemme tell you, and never even stopped for
 the storm. The night of the dance I heard all about how they had to hurry.
 And I guess Kent's there an' got a fire started, like I told him to. I was
 afraid it might be colder'n what it is. I asked him if he wouldn't ride
 over an' warm up the house t'day?and I see there's a smoke, all
 right." She looked at Manley, and then turned to Val. "Well, ain't you
 goin' to say anything? You dumb, both of you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val took a deep breath. "We should be dumb," she said contritely. "We
 should go down on our knees and beg their pardon and yours?I
 especially. I think I've never in my life felt quite so humbled?so
 overwhelmed with the goodness of my fellows, and my own unworthiness. I?I
 can't put it into words?all the resentment I have felt against the
 country and the people in it?as if?oh, tell them all how I
 want them to forgive me for?for the way I have felt. And?<i>Arline</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, now?I didn't bargain for you to make it so serious," Arline
 expostulated, herself near to crying. "It ain't nothing much?us
 folks believe in helpin' when help's needed, that's all. For Heaven's
 sake, don't go 'n' cry about it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hank pulled up at the gate with a loud <i>whoa</i> and a grip of the
 brake. From the kitchen stovepipe a blue ribbon of smoke waved high in the
 clear air. Kent appeared, grinning amiably, in the doorway, but Val was
 looking beyond, and scarcely saw him?beyond, where stood a new
 stable upon the ashes of the old; a new corral, the posts standing solidly
 in the holes dug for those burned away; a new haystack?when hay was
 almost priceless! A few chickens wandered about near the stable, and Val
 recognized them as Arline's prized Plymouth Rocks. Small wonder that she
 and Manley were stunned to silence. Manley still looked as if some one had
 dealt him an unexpected blow in the face. Val was white and wide-eyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Together they walked out to the stable. When they stopped, she put her
 hand timidly upon his aim. "Dear," she said softly, "there is only one way
 to thank them for this, and that is to be the very best it is in us to be.
 We will, won't we? We?we haven't been our best, but we'll start in
 right now. Shall we, Manley?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley looked down at her for a moment, saying nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall we, Manley? Let us start now, and try again. Let's play the fire
 burned up our old selves, and we're all new, and strong?shall we?
 And we won't feel any resentment for what is past, but we'll work
 together, and think together, and talk together, without any hidden thing
 we can't discuss freely. Please, Manley!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He knew what she meant, well enough. For the last two days he had been
 drinking again. On the night of the dance he had barely kept within the
 limit of decent behavior. He had read Val's complete understanding and her
 disgust the morning after?and since then they had barely spoken
 except when speech was necessary. Oh, he knew what she meant! He stood for
 another minute, and she let go his arm and stood apart, watching his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A good deal depended upon the next minute, and they both knew it, and
 hardly breathed. His hand went slowly into a deep pocket of his overcoat,
 his fingers closed over something, and drew it reluctantly to the light.
 Shamefaced, he held it up for her to see?a flat bottle of generous
 size, full to within a inch of the cork with a pale, yellow liquid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There?take it, and break it into a million pieces," he said
 huskily. "I'll try again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her yellow-brown eyes darkened perceptibly. "Manley Fleetwood, <i>you</i>
 must throw it away. This is your fight?be a man and <i>fight</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?there! May God damn me forever if I touch liquor again! I'm
 through with the stuff for keeps!" He held the bottle high, without
 looking at it, and sent it crashing against the stable door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley!" She stopped her ears, aghast at his words, but for all that her
 eyes were ashine. She went up to him and put her arms around him. "Now we
 can start all over again," she said. "We'll count our lives from this
 minute, dear, and we'll keep them clean and happy. Oh, I'm so glad! So
 glad and so proud, dear!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent had got half-way down the path from the house; he stopped when Manley
 threw the bottle, and waited. Now he turned abruptly and retraced his
 steps, and he did not look particularly happy, though he had been smiling
 when he left the kitchen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline turned from the window as he entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looks like Man has swore off ag'in," she observed dryly. "Well, let's
 hope 'n' pray he stays swore off."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XV. A COMPACT
 </h2>
 <p>
 The blackened prairie was fast hiding the mark of its fire torture under a
 cloak of tender new grass, vividly green as a freshly watered, well-kept
 lawn. Meadow larks hopped here and there, searching long for a sheltered
 nesting place, and missing the weeds where they were wont to sway and
 swell their yellow breasts and sing at the sun. They sang just as happily,
 however, on their short, low flights over the levels, or sitting upon
 gray, half-buried boulders upon some barren hilltop. Spring had come with
 lavish warmth. The smoke of burning ranges, the bleak winter with its
 sweeping storms of snow and wind, were pushed info the past, half
 forgotten in this new heaven and new earth, when men were glad simply
 because they were alive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On a still, Sunday morning?that day which, when work does not press,
 is set apart in the range land for slight errands, attention to one's
 personal affairs, and to the pursuit of pleasure?Kent jogged
 placidly down the long hill into Cold Spring Coulee and pulled up at the
 familiar little unpainted house of rough boards, with its incongruously
 dainty curtains at the windows and its tiny yard, green and scrupulously
 clean.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cat with white spots on its sides was washing its face on the kitchen
 doorstep. Val was kneeling beside the front porch, painstakingly stringing
 white grocery twine upon nails, which she drove into the rough posts with
 a small rock. The primitive trellis which resulted was obviously intended
 for the future encouragement of the sweet-pea plants just unfolding their
 second clusters of leaves an inch above ground. She did not see Kent at
 first, and he sat quiet in the saddle, watching her with a flicker of
 amusement in his eyes; but in a moment she struck her finger and sprang up
 with a sharp little cry, throwing the rock from her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't you know that was going to happen, sooner or later?" Kent
 inquired, and so made known his presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?how do you do?" She came smiling down to the gate, holding the
 hurt finger tightly clasped in the other hand. "How comes it you are
 riding this way? Our trail is all growing up to grass, so few ever travel
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're all hard-working folks these days. Where's Man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley is down to the river, I think." She rested both arms upon the
 gatepost and regarded him with her steady eyes. "If you can wait, he will
 be back soon. He only went to see if the river is fordable. He thinks two
 or three of our horses are on the other side, and he'd like to get them.
 The river has been too high, but it's lowering rather fast. Won't you come
 in?" She was pleasant, she was unusually friendly, but Kent felt vaguely
 that, somehow, she was different.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had not seen her for three months. Just after Christmas he had met her
 and Manley in town, when he was about to leave for a visit to his people
 in Nebraska. He had returned only a week or so before, and, if the truth
 were known, he was not displeased at the errand which brought him this
 way. He dismounted, and when she moved away from the gate he opened it and
 went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he began lightly, when he was seated upon the floor of the porch
 and she was back at her trellis, "and how's the world been using you? Had
 any more calamities while I've been gone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She busied herself with tying together two pieces of string, so that the
 whole would reach to a certain nail driven higher than her head. She stood
 with both hands uplifted, and her face, and her eyes; she did not reply
 for so long that Kent began to wonder if she had heard him. There was no
 reason why he should watch her so intently, or why he should want to get
 up and push back the one lock of hair which seemed always in rebellion and
 always falling across her temple by itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was drifting into a dreamy wonder that all women with yellow-brown hair
 should not be given yellow-brown eyes also, and to wishing vaguely that it
 might be his luck to meet one some time?one who was not married?when
 she looked down at him quite unexpectedly. He was startled, and half
 ashamed, and afraid that she might not like what he, had been thinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was staring straight into his eyes, and he knew that she was thinking
 of something that affected her a good deal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Unless it's a calamity to discover that the world is?what it is,
 and people in it are?what they are, and that you have been a blind
 idiot. Is that a calamity, Mr. Cowboy? Or is it a blessing? I've been
 wondering."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent discovered, when he started to speak, that he had run short of
 breath. "I reckon that depends on how the discovery pans out," he
 ventured, after a moment. He was not looking at her then. For some reason,
 unexplained to himself, he felt that it wasn't right for him to look at
 her; nor wise; nor quite pleasant in its effect. He did not know exactly
 what she meant, but he knew very well that she meant something more than
 to make conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That," she said, and gave a little sigh?"that takes so long?don't
 you know? The panning out, as you call it. It's hard to see things very
 clearly, and to make a decision that you know is going to stand the test,
 and then?just sit down and fold your hands, because some sordid,
 petty little reason absolutely prevents your doing anything. I hate
 waiting for anything. Don't you? When I want to do a thing, I want to do
 it immediately. These sweet-peas?now I've fixed the trellis for them
 to climb upon, I resent it because they don't take hold right now. Nasty
 little things?two inches high, when they should be two yards, and
 all covered with beautiful blossoms."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 {Illustration: "Little woman, listen here," he said. "You're playing hard
 luck, and I know it"}
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not the last of April," he qualified. "Give 'em a fair chance, can't you?
 They'll make it, all right; things take time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed surrenderingly, and came and sat down upon the porch near him,
 and tapped a slipper toe nervously upon the soft, green sod.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Time! Yes?" She threw back her head and smiled at him brightly?and
 appealingly, it seemed to Kent. "You remember what you told me once?about
 sheep-herders and <i>such</i> going crazy out here? The <i>such</i> is
 sometimes ready to agree with you." She turned her head with a quick
 impatience. "Such is learning to ride a horse," she informed him airily.
 "Such does it on the sly?and she fell off once and skinned her
 elbow, and she?well, Such hasn't any sidesaddle?but she's
 learning, 'by granny!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent laughed unsteadily, and looked sidelong at her with eyes alight. She
 matched the glance for just about one second, and turned her eyes away
 with a certain consciousness that gave Kent a savage delight. Of a truth,
 she was different! She was human, she was intolerably alluring. She was
 not the prim, perfectly well-bred young woman he had met at the train.
 Lonesome Land was doing its work. She was beginning to think as an
 individual?as a woman; not merely as a member of conventional
 society.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such is beginning to be the proper stuff?'by granny," he told her
 softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was afraid his tone had offended her. She rose, and her color flared
 and faded. She leaned slightly against the post beside her, and, with a
 hand thrown up and half shielding her face, she stared out across the
 coulee to the hill beyond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you?I feel like a fool for talking like this, but one sometimes
 clutches at the least glimmer of sympathy and?and understanding, and
 speaks what should be kept bottled up inside, I suppose. But I've been
 bottled up for so <i>long</i>?" She struck her free hand suddenly
 against her lips, as if she would apply physical force to keep them from
 losing all self-control. When she spoke again, her voice was calmer. "Did
 you ever get to the point, Mr. Cowboy, where you?you dug right down
 to the bottom of things, and found that you must do something or go mad?and
 there wasn't a thing you could do? Did you ever?" She did not turn toward
 him, but kept her eyes to the hills. When he did not answer, however, she
 swung her head slowly and looked down at him, where he sat almost at her
 feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent was leaning forward, studying the gashes he had cut in the sod with
 his spurs. His brows were knitted close.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I kinda think I'm getting there pretty fast," he owned gravely when he
 felt her gaze upon him. "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?because you can understand how one must speak sometimes. Ever
 since I came, you have been?I don't know?different. At first I
 didn't like you at all; but I could see you were different. Since then?well,
 you have now and then said something that made me see one could speak to
 you, and you would understand. So I?" She broke off suddenly and
 laughed an apology. "Am I boring you dreadfully? One grows so
 self-centered living alone. If you aren't interested?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am." Kent was obliged to clear his throat to get those two words out.
 "Go on. Say all you want to say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed again wearily. "Lately," she confessed nervously, "I've taken
 to telling my thoughts to the cat. It's perfectly safe, but, after all, it
 isn't quite satisfying." She stopped again, and stood silent for a moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because I am alone, day after day, week in and week out," she went
 on. "In a way, I don't mind it?under the circumstances I prefer to
 be alone, really. I mean, I wouldn't want any of my people near me. But
 one has too much time to think. I tell you this because I feel I ought to
 let you know that you were right that time; I don't suppose you even
 remember it! But I do. Once last fall?the first time you came to the
 ranch?you know, the time I met you at the spring, you seemed to see
 that this big, lonesome country was a little too much for me. I resented
 it then. I didn't want any one to tell me what I refused to admit to
 myself. I was trying so hard to like it?it seemed my only hope, you
 see. But now I'll tell you you were right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes I feel very wicked about it. Sometimes I don't care. And
 sometimes I?I feel I shall go crazy if I can't talk to some one.
 Nobody comes here, except Polycarp Jenks. The only woman I know really
 well in the country is Arline Hawley. She's good as gold, but?she's
 intensely practical; you can't tell her your troubles?not unless
 they're concrete and have to do with your physical well-being. Arline
 lacks imagination." She laughed again shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know why I'm taking it for granted you don't," she said. "You
 think I'm talking pore nonsense, don't you, Mr. Cowboy?" She turned full
 toward him, and her yellow-brown eyes challenged him, begged him for
 sympathy and understanding, held him at bay?but most of all they set
 his blood pounding sullenly in his veins. He got unsteadily to his feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem to pass up a lot of things that count, or you wouldn't say
 that," he reminded her huskily. "That night in town, just after the fire,
 for instance. And here, that same afternoon. I tried to jolly you out of
 feeling bad, both those times; but you know I understood. You know damn'
 <i>well</i> I understood! And you know I was sorry. And if you don't know,
 I'd do anything on God's green earth?" He turned sharply away from
 her and stood kicking savagely backward at a clod with his rowel. Then he
 felt her hand touch his arm, and started. After that he stood perfectly
 still, except that he quivered like a frightened horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it doesn't mean much to you?you have your life, and you're a
 man, and can do things when you want to. But I do so need a friend! Just
 somebody who understands, to whom I can talk when that is the only thing
 will keep me sane. You saved my life once, so I feel?no, I don't
 mean that. It isn't because of anything you did; it's just that I feel I
 can talk to you more freely than to any one I know. I don't mean whine. I
 hope I'm not a whiner. If I've blundered, I'm willing to?to take my
 medicine, as you would say. But if I can feel that somewhere in this big,
 empty country just one person will always feel kindly toward me, and wish
 me well, and be sorry for we when I?when I'm miserable, and?"
 She could not go on. She pressed her lips together tightly, and winked
 back the tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent faced about and laid both his hands upon her shoulders. His face was
 very tender and rather sad, and if she had only understood as well as he
 did?. But she did not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Little woman, listen here," he said. "You're playing hard luck, and I
 know it; maybe I don't know just how hard?but maybe I can kinda give
 a guess. If you'll think of me as your friend?your pal, and if
 you'll always tell yourself that your pal is going to stand by you, no
 matter what comes, why?all right." He caught his breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She smiled up at him, honestly pleased, wholly without guile?and
 wholly blind. "I'd rather have such a friend, just now, than anything I
 know, except?. But if your sweetheart should object?could you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His fingers gripped her shoulders tighter for just a second, and he let
 her go. "I guess that part'll be all right," he rejoined in a tone she
 could not quite fathom. "I never had one in m' life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you poor thing!" She stood back and tilted her head at him. "You
 poor?<i>pal</i>. I'll have to see about that immediately. Every
 young man wants a sweetheart?at least, all the young men I ever knew
 wanted one, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I'll gamble they all wanted the same one," he hinted wickedly,
 feeling himself unreasonably happy over something he could not quite put
 into words, even if he had dared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no. Hardly ever the same one, luckily. Do you know?pal, I've
 quite forgotten what it was all about?the unburdening of my soul, I
 mean. After all, I think I must have been just lonesome. The country is
 just as big, but it isn't quite so?so <i>empty</i>, you see. Aren't
 you awfully vain, to see how you have peopled it with your friendship?"
 She clasped her hands behind her and regarded him speculatively. "I hope,
 Mr. Cowboy, you're in earnest about this," she observed doubtfully. "I
 hope you have imagination enough to see it isn't silly, because if I
 suspected you weren't playing fair, and would go away and laugh at me, I'd?scratch?you."
 She nodded her head slowly at him. "I've always been told that, with tiger
 eyes, you find the disposition of a tiger. So if you don't mean it, you'd
 better let me know at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent brought the color into her cheeks with his steady gaze. "I was just
 getting scared <i>you</i> didn't mean it," he averred. "If my pal goes
 back on me?why, Lord help her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took a slow, deep breath. "How is it you men ratify a solemn
 agreement?" she puzzled. "Oh, yes." With a pretty impulse she held out her
 right hand, half grave, half playful. "Shake on it, pal!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent took her hand and pressed it as hard as he dared. "You're going to be
 a dandy little chum," he predicted gamely. "But let me tell you right now,
 if you ever get up on your stilts with me, there's going to be all kinds
 of trouble. You call me Kent?that is," he qualified, with a little,
 unsteady laugh, "when there ain't any one around to get shocked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose this <i>isn't</i> quite conventional," she conceded, as if the
 thought had just then occurred to her. "But, thank goodness, out here
 there aren't any conventions. Every one lives as every one sees fit. It
 isn't the best thing for some people," she added drearily. "Some people
 have to be bolstered up by conventions, or they can't help miring in their
 own weaknesses. But we don't; and as long as we understand?" She
 looked to him for confirmation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As long as we understand, why, it ain't anybody's business but our own,"
 he declared steadily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed relieved of some lingering doubt. "That's exactly it. I don't
 know why I should deny myself a friend, just because that friend happens
 to be a man, and I happen to be?married. I never did have much
 patience with the rule that a man must either be perfectly indifferent, or
 else make love. I'm so glad you?understand. So that's all settled,"
 she finished briskly, "and I find that, as I said, it isn't at all
 necessary for me to unburden my soul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stood quiet for a moment, their thoughts too intangible for speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come inside, won't you?" she invited at last, coming back to everyday
 matters. "Of course you're hungry?or you ought to be. You daren't
 run away from my cooking this time, Mr. Cowboy. Manley will be back soon,
 I think. I must get some lunch ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent replied that he would stay outside and smoke, so she left him with a
 fleeting smile, infinitely friendly and confiding and glad. He turned and
 looked after her soberly, gave a great sigh, and reached mechanically for
 his tobacco and papers; thoughtfully rolled a cigarette, lighted it, and
 held the match until it burned quite down to his thumb and fingers.
 "Pals!" he said just under his breath, for the mere sound of the word.
 "All right?pals it is, then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He smoked slowly, listening to her moving about in the house. Her steps
 came nearer. He turned to look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was it you wanted to see Manley about?" she asked him from the
 doorway. "I just happened to wonder what it could be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, the Wishbone needs men, and sent me over to tell him he can go to
 work. The wagons are going to start to-morrow. He'll want to gather his
 cattle up, and of course we know about how he's fixed?for saddle
 horses and the like. He can work for the outfit and draw wages, and get
 his cattle thrown back on this range and his calves branded besides. Get
 paid for doing what he'll have to do anyhow, you see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see." Val pushed back the rebellious lock of hair. "Of course you
 suggested the idea to the Wishbone. You're always doing something?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The outfit is short-handed," he reiterated. "They need him. They ain't
 straining a point to do Man a favor?don't you ever think it! Well?he's
 coming," he broke off, and started to the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley clattered up, vociferously glad to greet him. Kent, at his urgent
 invitation, led his horse to the stable and turned him into the corral,
 unsaddled and unbridled him so that he could eat. Also, he told his
 errand. Manley interrupted the conversation to produce a bottle of whisky
 from a cunningly concealed hole in the depleted haystack, and insisted
 that Kent should take a drink. Kent waved it off, and Manley drew the cork
 and held the bottle to his own lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he stood there, with his face uplifted while the yellow liquor gurgled
 down his throat, Kent watched him with a curiously detached interest. So
 that's how Manley had kept his vow! he was thinking, with an impersonal
 contempt. Four good swallows?Kent counted them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're hitting it pretty strong, Man, for a fellow that swore off last
 fall," he commented aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley took down the bottle, gave a sigh of pure, animal satisfaction, and
 pushed the cork in with an unconsciously regretful movement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fellow's got to get something out of life," he defended peevishly.
 "I've had pretty hard luck?it's enough to drive a fellow to most any
 kind of relief. Burnt out, last fall?cattle scattered and calves
 running the range all winter?I haven't got stock enough to stand
 that sort of a deal, Kent. No telling where I stand now on the cattle
 question. I did have close to a hundred head?and three of my best
 geldings are missing?a poor man can't stand luck like that. I'm in
 debt too?and when you've got an iceberg in the house?when a
 man's own wife don't stand by him?when he can't get any sympathy
 from the very one that ought to?but, then, I hope I'm a gentleman; I
 don't make any kick against <i>her</i>?my domestic affairs are my
 own affairs. Sure. But when your wife freezes up solid?" He held the
 bottle up and looked at it. "Best friend I've got," he finished, with a
 whining note in his voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent turned away disgusted. Manley had coarsened. He had "slopped down"
 just when he should have braced up and caught the fighting spirit?the
 spirit that fights and overcomes obstacles. With a tightening of his
 chest, he thought of his "pal," tied for life to this whining drunkard. No
 wonder she felt the need of a friend!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, are you going out with the Wishbone?" he asked tersely, jerking his
 thoughts back to his errand. "If you are, you'll need to go over there
 to-night?the wagons start out to-morrow. Maybe you better ride
 around by Polly's place and have him come over here, once in a while, to
 look after things. You can't leave your wife alone without somebody to
 kinda keep an eye out for her, you know. Polycarp ain't going to ride this
 spring; he's got rheumatism, or some darned thing. But he can chop what
 wood she'll need, and go to town for her once in a while, and make sure
 she's all right. You better leave your gentlest horse here for her to use,
 too. She can't be left afoot out here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley was taking another long swallow from the bottle, but he heard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, sure?I never thought about that. I guess maybe I <i>had</i>
 better get Polycarp. But Val could make out all right alone. Why, she's
 held it down here for a week at a time?last winter, when I'd forgot
 to come home"?he winked shamelessly?"or a storm would come up
 so I couldn't get home. Val isn't like some fool women, I'll say that much
 for her. She don't care whether I'm around or not; fact is, sometimes I
 think she's better pleased when I'm gone. But you're right?I'll see
 Polycarp and have him come over once in a while. Sure. Glad you spoke of
 it. You always had a great head for thinking about other people, Kent. You
 ought to get married."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thanks," Kent scowled. "I haven't got any grudge against women. The
 world's full of men ready and willing to give 'em a taste of pure,
 unadulterated hell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley stared at him stupidly, and then laughed doubtfully, as if he felt
 certain of having, by his dullness, missed the point of a very good joke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After that the time was filled with the preparations for Manley's absence.
 Kent did what he could to help, and Val went calmly about the house,
 packing the few necessary personal belongings which might be stuffed into
 a "war bag" and used during round-up. Beyond an occasional glance of
 friendly understanding, she seemed to have forgotten the compact she had
 made with Kent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when they were ready to ride away, Kent purposely left his gloves
 lying upon the couch, and remembered them only after Manley was in the
 saddle. So he went back, and Val followed him into the room. He wanted to
 say something?he did not quite know what?something that would
 bring them a little closer together, and keep them so; something that
 would make her think of him often and kindly. He picked up his gloves and
 held out his hand to her?and then a diffidence seized his tongue.
 There was nothing he dared say. All the eloquence, all the tenderness, was
 in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?good-by, pal. Be good to yourself," he said simply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val smiled up at him tremulously. "Good-by, my one friend. Don't?don't
 get hurt!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their clasp tightened, their hands dropped apart rather limply. Kent went
 out and got upon his horse, and rode away beside Manley, and talked of the
 range and of the round-up and of cattle and a dozen other things which
 interest men. But all the while one exultant thought kept reiterating
 itself in his mind: "She never said that much to <i>him!</i> She never
 said that much to <i>him!</i>"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVI. MANLEY'S NEW TACTICS
 </h2>
 <p>
 To the east, to the south, to the north went the riders of the Wishbone,
 gathering the cattle which the fires had driven afar. No rivers stopped
 them, nor mountains, nor the deep-scarred coulees, nor the plains. It was
 Manley's first experience in real round-up work, for his own little herd
 he had managed to keep close at home, and what few strayed afar were
 turned back, when opportunity afforded, by his neighbors, who wished him
 well. Now he tasted the pride of ownership to the full, when a VP cow and
 her calf mingled with the milling Wishbones and Double Diamonds. He was
 proud of his brand, and proud of the sentiment which had made him choose
 Val's initials. More than once he explained to his fellows that VP meant
 Val Peyson, and that he had got it recorded just after he and Val were
 engaged. He was not sentimental about her now, but he liked to dwell upon
 the fact that he had been; it showed that he was capable of fine feeling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 More dominant, however, as the weeks passed and the branding went on,
 became the desire to accumulate property?cattle. The Wishbone brand
 went scorching through the hair of hundreds of calves, while the VP scared
 tens. It was not right. He felt, somehow, cheated by fate. He mentally
 figured the increase of his herd, and it seemed to him that it took a long
 while, much longer than it should, to gain a respectable number in that
 manner. He cast about in his mind for some rich acquaintance in the East
 who might be prevailed upon to lend him capital enough to buy, say, five
 hundred cows. He began to talk about it occasionally when the boys lay
 around in the evenings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You want to ride with a long rope," suggested Bob Royden, grinning openly
 at the others. "That's the way to work up in the cow business. Capital
 nothing! You don't get enough excitement buying cattle; you want to steal
 'em. That's what I'd do if I had a brand of my own and all your ambitions
 to get rich."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And get sent up," Manley rounded out the situation. "No, thanks." He
 laughed. "It's a better way to get to the pen than it is to get rich, from
 all accounts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sandy Moran remembered a fellow who worked a brand and kept it up for
 seven or eight years before they caught him, and he recounted the tale
 between puffs at his cigarette. "Only they didn't catch him" he finished.
 "A puncher put him wise to what was in the wind, and he sold out cheap to
 a tenderfoot and pulled his freight. They never did locate him." Then,
 with a pointed rock which he picked up beside him, he drew a rude diagram
 or two in the dirt. "That's how he done it," he explained. "Pretty smooth,
 too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the talk went on, as such things will, idly, without purpose save to
 pass the time. Shop talk of the range it was. Tales of stealing, of
 working brands, and of branding unmarked yearlings at weaning time. Of
 this big cattleman and that, who practically stole whole herds, and
 thereby took long strides toward wealth. Range scandals grown old; range
 gossip all of it, of men who had changed a brand or made one, using a
 cinch ring at a tiny fire in a secluded hollow, or a spur, or a jackknife;
 who were caught in the act, after the act, or merely suspected of the
 crime. Of "sweat" brands, blotched brands, brands added to and altered, of
 trials, of shootings, of hangings, even, and "getaways" spectacular and
 humorous and pathetic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley, being in a measure a pilgrim, and having no experience to draw
 upon, and not much imagination, took no part in the talk, except that he
 listened and was intensely interested. Two months of mingling with men who
 talked little else had its influence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That fall, when Manley had his hay up, and his cattle once more ranging
 close, toward the river and in the broken country bounded upon the west by
 the fenced-in railroad, three calves bore the VP brand?three husky
 heifers that never had suckled a VP mother. So had the range gossip, sown
 by chance in the soil of his greed of gain and his weakening moral fiber,
 borne fruit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The deed scared him sober for a month. For a month his color changed and
 his blood quickened whenever a horseman showed upon the rim of Cold Spring
 Coulee. For a month he never left the ranch unless business compelled him
 to do so, and his return was speedy, his eyes anxious until he knew that
 all was well. After that his confidence returned. He grew more secretive,
 more self-assured, more at ease with his guilt. He looked the Wishbone men
 squarely in the eye, and it seldom occurred to him that he was a thief; or
 if it did, the word was but a synonym for luck, with shrewdness behind.
 Sometimes he regretted his timidity. Why three calves only? In a deep
 little coulee next the river?a coulee which the round-up had missed?had
 been more than three. He might have doubled the number and risked no more
 than for the three. The longer he dwelt upon that the more inclined he was
 to feel that he had cheated himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That fall there were no fires. It would be long before men grew careless
 when the grass was ripened and the winds blew hot and dry from out the
 west. The big prairie which lay high between the river and Hope was dotted
 with feeding cattle. Wishbones and Double Diamonds, mostly, with here and
 there a stray.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley grew wily, and began to plan far in advance. He rode here and
 there, quietly keeping his own cattle well down toward the river. There
 was shelter there, and feed, and the idea was a good one. Just before the
 river broke up he saw to it that a few of his own cattle, and with them
 some Wishbone cows and a steer or two, were ranging in a deep, bushy
 coulee, isolated and easily passed by. He had driven them there, and he
 left them there. That spring he worked again with the Wishbone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the round-up swept the home range, gathering and branding, it chanced
 that his part of the circle took him and Sandy Moran down that way. It was
 hot, and they had thirty or forty head of cattle before them when they
 neared that particular place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No need going down into the breaks here," he told Sandy easily. "I've
 been hazing out everything I came across lately. They were mostly my own,
 anyway. I believe I've got it pretty well cleaned up along here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sandy was not the man to hunt hard riding. He went to the rim of the
 coulee and looked down for a minute. He saw nothing moving, and took
 Manley's word for it with no stirring of his easy-going conscience. He
 said all right, and rode on.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVII. VAL BECOMES AN AUTHOR
 </h2>
 <p>
 Quite as marked had been the change in Val that year. Every time Kent saw
 her, he recognized the fact that she was a little different; a little less
 superior in her attitude, a little more independent in her views of life.
 Her standards seemed slowly changing, and her way of thinking. He did not
 see her often, but when he did the mockery of their friendship struck him
 more keenly, his inward rebellion against circumstances grew more bitter.
 He wondered how she could be so blind as to think they were just pals, and
 no more. She did think so. All the little confidences, all the glances,
 all the smiles, she gave and received frankly, in the name of friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, Kent, this is my ideal of how people should be," she told him
 once, with a perfectly honest enthusiasm. "I've always dreamed of such a
 friendship, and I've always believed that some day the right man would
 come along and make it possible. Not one in a thousand could understand
 and meet one half-way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd be liable to go farther," Kent assented dryly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. That's just the trouble. They'd spoil an ideal friendship by falling
 in love."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Darned chumps," Kent classed them sweepingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Exactly. Pal, your vocabulary excites my envy. It's so forcible
 sometimes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent grinned reminiscently. "It sure is, old girl."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't mean necessarily profane. I wonder what your vocabulary will
 do to the secret I'm going to tell you." The sweet-peas had reached the
 desired height and profusion of blossoms, thanks to the pails and pails of
 water Val had carried and lavished upon them, and she was gathering a
 handful of the prettiest blooms for him. Her cheeks turned a bit pinker as
 she spoke, and her hesitation raised a wild hope briefly in Kent's heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" He had to force the words out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I hate to tell, but I want you to?to help me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" To Kent, at that moment, she was not Manley's wife; she was not
 any man's wife; she was the girl he loved?loved with the primitive,
 absorbing passion of the man who lives naturally and does not borrow his
 morals from his next-door neighbor. His code of ethics was his own,
 thought out by himself. Val hated her husband, and her husband did not
 seem to care much for her. They were tied together legally. And a mere
 legality could not hold back the emotions and the desires of Kent Burnett.
 With him, it was not a question of morals: it was a question of Val's
 feeling in the matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val looked up at him, found something strange in his eyes, and immediately
 looked away again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your eyes are always saying things I can't hear," she observed
 irrelevantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they? Do you want me to act as interpreter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I just want you to listen. Have you noticed anything different about
 me lately, Kent?" She tilted her head, while she passed judgment upon a
 cluster of speckled blossoms, odd but not particularly pretty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean, anyway? I'm liable to get off wrong if I tell you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you're so horribly cautious! Have I seemed any more content?any
 happier lately?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent picked a spray of flowers and puled them ruthlessly to pieces. "Maybe
 I've kinda hoped so," he said, almost in a whisper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've a new interest in life. I just discovered it by accident,
 almost?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent lifted his head and looked keenly at her, and his face was a lighter
 shade of brown than it had been.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It seems to change everything. Pal, I?I've been writing things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent discovered he had been holding his breath, and let it go in a long
 sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" After a minute he smiled philosophically. "What kinda things?" he
 drawled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, verses, but mostly stories. You see," she explained impulsively, "I
 want to earn some money?of my own. I haven't said much, because I
 hate whining; but really, things are growing pretty bad?between
 Manley and me. I hope it isn't my fault. I have tried every way I know to
 keep my faith in him, and to?to help him. But he's not the same as
 he was. You know that. And I have a good deal of pride. I can't?oh,
 it's intolerable having to ask a man for money! Especially when he doesn't
 want to give you any," she added naively. "At first it wasn't necessary; I
 had a little of my own, and all my things were new. But one must
 eventually buy things?for the house, you know, and for one's
 personal needs?and he seems to resent it dreadfully. I never would
 have believed that Manley could be stingy?actually stingy; but he
 is, unfortunately. I hate to speak of his faults, even to you. But I've
 got to be honest with you. It isn't nice to say that I'm writing, not for
 any particularly burning desire to express my thoughts, nor for the
 sentiment of it, but to earn money. It's terribly sordid, isn't it?" She
 smiled wistfully up at him. "But there seems to be money in it, for those
 who succeed, and it's work that I can do here. I have oceans of time, and
 I'm not disturbed!" Her lips curved into bitter lines. "I do so much
 thinking, I might as well put my brain to some use." With one of her
 sudden changes of mood, she turned to Kent and clasped both hands upon his
 arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you see, pal, how much our friendship means to me," she said softly.
 "I couldn't have told this to another living soul! It seems awfully
 treacherous, saying it even to you?I mean about him. But you're so
 good?you always understand, don't you, pal?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess so." Kent forced the words out naturally, and kept his breath
 even, and his arms from clasping her. He considered that he performed
 quite a feat of endurance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're modest!" She gave his arm a little shake. "Of course you do. You
 know I'm not treacherous, really. You know I'd do anything I could for
 him. But this is something that doesn't concern him at all. He doesn't
 know it, but that is because he would only sneer. When I have really sold
 something, and received the money for it, then it won't matter to me who
 knows. But now it's a solemn secret, just between me and my pal." Her
 yellow-brown eyes dwelt upon his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent, stealing a glance at her from under his drooped lids, wondered if
 she had ever given any time to analyzing herself. He would have given much
 to know if, down deep in her heart, she really believed in this pal
 business; if she was really a friend, and no more. She puzzled him a good
 deal, sometimes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?if anybody can make good at that business, you sure ought to;
 you've got brains enough to write a dictionary." He permitted himself the
 indulgence of saying that much, and he was perfectly sincere. He honestly
 considered Val the cleverest woman in the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed with gratification. "Your sublime confidence, while it is
 undoubtedly mistaken, is nevertheless appreciated," she told him primly,
 moving away with her hands full of flowers. "If you've got the nerve, come
 inside and read some of my stuff; I want to know if it's any good at all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently he was seated upon the couch in the little, pathetically bright
 front room, and he was knitting his eyebrows over Val's beautifully
 regular handwriting,?pages and pages of it, so that there seemed no
 end to the task,?and was trying to give his mind to what he was
 reading instead of to the author, sitting near him with her hands folded
 demurely in her lap and her eyes fixed expectantly upon his face, trying
 to read his decision even as it was forming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some verses she had tried on him first. Kent, by using all his
 determination of character, read them all, every word of them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's sure all right," he said, though, beyond a telling phrase or two,?one
 line in particular which would stick in his memory:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Men live and love and die in that lonely land,"?
</pre>
 <p>
 he had no very clear idea of what it was all about. Certain lines seemed
 to go bumping along, and one had to mispronounce some of the final words
 to make them rhyme with others gone before, but it was all right?Val
 wrote it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I do better at stories," she ventured modestly. "I wrote one?a
 little story about university life?and sent it to a magazine. They
 wrote a lovely letter about it, but it seems that field is overdone, or
 something. The editor asked me why, living out here in the very heart of
 the West, I don't try Western stories. I think I shall?and that's
 why I said I should need your help. I thought we might work together, you
 know. You've lived here so long, and ought to have some splendid ideas?things
 that have happened, or that you've heard?and you could tell me, and
 I'd write them up. Wouldn't you like to collaborate?'go in cahoots'
 on it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure." Kent regarded her thoughtfully. She really was looking brighter
 and happier, and her enthusiasm was not to be mistaken. Her world had
 changed. "Anything I can do to help, you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course I know, I think it's perfectly splendid, don't you? We'll
 divide the money?when there <i>is</i> any, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will we?" His tone was noncommittal in the extreme.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course. Now, don't let's quarrel about that till we come to it. I have
 a good idea of my own, I think, for the first story. A man comes out here
 and disappears, you know, and after a while his sister comes to find him.
 She gets into all kinds of trouble?is kidnapped by a gang of
 robbers, and kept in a cave. When the leader of the gang comes back?he
 has been away on some depredation?you see, I have only the bare
 outline of the story yet?and, well, it's her brother! He kills the
 one who kidnapped her, and she reforms him. Of course, there ought to be
 some love interest. I think, perhaps, one member of the gang ought to fall
 in love with her, don't you know? And after a while he wins her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She'll reform him, too, I reckon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes. She couldn't love a man she couldn't respect?no woman
 could."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" Kent took a minute to apply that personally. It was of value to him,
 because it was an indication of Val's own code. "Maybe," he suggested
 tentatively, "she'd get busy and reform the whole bunch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, say?that would be great! She's an awfully sweet little thing?perfectly
 lovely, you know?and they'd all be in love with her, so it wouldn't
 be improbable. Don't you remember, Kent, you told me once that a man would
 do <i>anything</i> for a woman, if he cared enough for her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. He would, too." Kent fought back a momentary temptation to prove
 the truth of it by his own acquiescence in this pal business. He was saved
 from disaster by a suspicion that Val would not be able to see it from his
 point of view, and by the fact that he would much rather be pals than
 nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She would have gone on, talking and planning and discussing, indefinitely.
 But the sun slid lower and lower, and Kent was not his own master. The
 time came when he had to go, regardless of his own wishes, or hers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came again, the story was finished, and Val was waiting, with
 extreme impatience, to read it to him and hear his opinion before she sent
 it away. Kent was not so impatient to hear it, but he did not tell her so.
 He had not seen her for a month, and he wanted to talk; not about anything
 in particular?just talk about little things, and see her eyes light
 up once in a while, and her lips purse primly when he said something
 daring, and maybe have her play something on the violin, while he smoked
 and watched her slim wrist bend and rise and fall with the movement of the
 bow. He could imagine no single thing more fascinating than that?that,
 and the way she cuddled the violin under her chin, in the hollow of her
 neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Val would not play?she had been too busy to practice, all spring
 and summer; she scarcely ever touched the violin, she said. And she did
 not want to talk?or if she did, it was plain that she had only one
 theme. So Kent, perforce, listened to the story. Afterward, he assured her
 that it was "outa sight." As a matter of fact, half the time he had not
 heard a word of what she was reading; he had been too busy just looking at
 her and being glad he was there. He had, however, a dim impression that it
 was a story with people in it whom one does not try to imagine as ever
 being alive, and with a West which, beyond its evident scarcity of
 inhabitants, was not the West he knew anything about. One paragraph of
 description had caught his attention, because it seemed a fairly accurate
 picture of the bench land which surrounded Cold Spring Coulee; but it had
 not seemed to have anything to do with the story itself. Of course, it
 must be good?Val wrote it. He began to admire her intensely, quite
 apart from his own personal subjugation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was pleased with his praise. For two solid hours she talked of nothing
 but that story, and she gave him some fresh chocolate cake and a pitcher
 of lemonade, and urged him to come again in about three weeks, when she
 expected to hear from the magazine she thought would be glad to take the
 story; the one whose editor had suggested that she write of the West.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the fall, and in the winter, their discussions were frequently hampered
 by Manley's presence. But Val's enthusiasm, though nipped here and there
 by unappreciative editors, managed, somehow, to live; or perhaps it had
 developed into a dogged determination to succeed in spite of everything.
 She still wrote things, and she still read them to Kent when there was
 time and opportunity; sometimes he was bold enough to criticize the worst
 places, and to tell her how she might, in his opinion, remedy them.
 Occasionally Val would take his advice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the months passed. The winds blew and brought storm and heat and
 sunshine and cloud. Nothing, in that big land, appreciably changed, except
 the people; and they so imperceptibly that they failed to realize it until
 afterward.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVIII. VAL'S DISCOVERY
 </h2>
 <p>
 With a blood-red sun at his back and a rosy tinge upon all the hills
 before him, Manley rode slowly down the western rim of Cold Spring Coulee,
 driving five rebellious calves that had escaped the branding iron in the
 spring. Though they were not easily driven in any given direction, he was
 singularly patient with them, and refrained from bellowing epithets and
 admonitions, as might have been expected. When he was almost down the
 hill, he saw Val standing in the kitchen door, shading her eyes with her
 hands that she might watch his approach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Open the corral gate!" he shouted to her, in the tone of command. "And
 stand back where you can head 'em off if they start up the coulee!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val replied by doing as she was told; she was not in the habit of wasting
 words upon Manley; they seemed always to precipitate an unpleasant
 discussion of some sort, as if he took it for granted she disapproved of
 all he did or said, and was always upon the defensive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The calves came on, lumbering awkwardly in a half-hearted gallop, as if
 they had very little energy left. Their tongues protruded, their mouths
 dribbled a lathery foam, and their rough, sweaty hides told Val of the
 long chase?for she was wiser in the ways of the range land than she
 had been. She stood back, gently waving her ruffled white apron at them,
 and when they dodged into the corral, rolling eyes at her, she ran up and
 slammed the gate shut upon them, looped the chain around the post, and
 dropped the iron hook into a link to fasten it. Manley galloped up, threw
 himself off his panting horse, and began to unsaddle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get some wood and start a fire, and put the iron in, Val," he told her
 brusquely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val looked at him quickly. "Now? Supper's all ready, Manley. There's no
 hurry about branding them, is there?" And she added: "Dear me! The
 round-up must have just skimmed the top off this range last spring. You've
 had to brand a lot of calves that were missed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What the devil is it to you?" he demanded roughly. "I want that fire,
 madam, and I want it <i>now</i>. I rather think I knew when I want to
 brand without asking your advice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val curved her lips scornfully, shrugged and obeyed She was used to that
 sort of thing, and she did not mind very much. He had brutalized by
 degrees, and by degrees she had hardened. He could rouse no feeling now
 but contempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you'll kindly wait until I put back the supper," she said coldly. "I
 suppose in your zeal one need not sacrifice your food; you're still rather
 particular about that. I observe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley was leading his horse to the stable, and, though he answered
 something, the words were no more than a surly mumble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's been drinking again," Val decided dispassionately, on the way to the
 house. "I suppose he carried a bottle in his pocket?and emptied it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was not long; there was a penalty of profane reproach attached to
 delay, however slight, when Manley was in that mood. She had the fire
 going and the VP iron heating by the time he had stabled and fed his
 horse, and had driven the calves into the smaller pen. He drove a big,
 line-backed heifer into a corner, roped and tied her down with surprising
 dexterity, and turned impatiently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come! Isn't that iron ready yet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val, on the other side of the fence, drew it out and inspected it
 indifferently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not, Mr. Fleetwood. If you are in a very great hurry, why not apply
 your temper to it?and a few choice remarks?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't try to be sarcastic?it's too pathetic. Kick a little life
 into that fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir?thank you, sir." Val could be rather exasperating when she
 chose. She always could be sure of making Manley silently furious when she
 adopted that tone of respectful servility?as employed by butlers and
 footmen upon the stage. Her mimicry, be it said, was very good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Ere it is, sir??thank you, sir?'ope I 'aven't kept you
 wyting, sir," she announced, after he had fumed for two minutes inside the
 corral, and she had cynically hummed her way quite through the hymn which
 begins "Blest be the tie that binds." She passed the white-hot iron deftly
 through the rails to him, and fixed the fire for another heating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Really, she was not thinking of Manley at all, nor of his mood, nor of his
 brutal coarseness. She was thinking of the rebuilt typewriter, advertised
 as being exactly as good as a new one, and scandalously cheap, for which
 she had sold her watch to Arline Hawley to get money to buy. She was
 counting mentally the days since she had sent the money order, and was
 thinking it should come that week surely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was also planning to seize upon the opportunity afforded by Manley's
 next absence for a day from the ranch, and drive to Hope on the chance of
 getting the machine. Only?she wished she could be sure whether Kent
 would be coming soon. She did not want to miss seeing him; she decided to
 sound Polycarp Jenks the next time he came. Polycarp would know, of
 course, whether the Wishbone outfit was in from round-up. Polycarp always
 knew everything that had been done, or was intended, among the neighbors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manley passed the ill-smelling iron back to her, and she put it in the
 fire, quite mechanically. It was not the first time, nor the second, that
 she had been called upon to help brand. She could heat an iron as quickly
 and evenly as most men, though Manley had never troubled to tell her so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Five times she heated the iron, and heard, with an inward quiver of pity
 and disgust, the spasmodic blat of the calf in the pen when the VP went
 searing into the hide on its ribs. She did not see why they must be
 branded that evening, in particular, but it was as well to have it done
 with. Also, if Manley meant to wean them, she would have to see that they
 were fed and watered, she supposed. That would make her trip to town a
 hurried one, if she went at all; she would have to go and come the same
 day, and Arline Hawley would scold and beg her to stay, and call her a
 fool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, how about that supper?" asked Manley, when they were through, and
 the air was clearing a little from the smoke and the smell of burned hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I really don't know?I smelled the potatoes burning some time ago.
 I'll see, however." She brushed her hands with her handkerchief, pushed
 back the lock of hair that was always falling across her temple, and,
 because she was really offended by Manley's attitude and tone, she sang
 softly all the way to the house, merely to conceal from him the fact that
 he could move her even to irritation. Her best weapon, she had discovered
 long ago, was absolute indifference?the indifference which
 overlooked his presence and was deaf to his recriminations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She completed her preparations for his supper, made sure that nothing was
 lacking and that the tea was just right, placed his chair in position,
 filled the water glass beside his plate, set the tea-pot where he could
 reach it handily, and went into the living room and closed the door
 between. In the past year, filed as it had been with her literary
 ambitions and endeavors, she had neglected her music; but she took her
 violin from the box, hunted the cake of resin, tuned the strings, and,
 when she heard him come into the kitchen and sit down at the table, seated
 herself upon the front doorstep and began to play.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was one bit of music which Manley thoroughly detested. That was the
 "Traumerei." Therefore, she played the "Traumerei" slowly?as it
 should, of course, be played?with full value given to all the
 pensive, long-drawn notes, and with a finale positively creepy in its
 dreamy wistfulness. Val, as has been stated, could be very exasperating
 when she chose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the kitchen there was the subdued rattle of dishes, unbroken and
 unhurried. Val went on playing, but she forgot that she had begun in a
 half-conscious desire to annoy her husband. She stared dreamily at the
 hill which shut out the world to the east, and yielded to a mood of
 loneliness; of longing, in the abstract, for all the pleasant things she
 was missing in this life which she had chosen in her ignorance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Manley flung open the inner door, she gave a stifled exclamation; she
 had forgotten all about Manley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By all the big and little gods of Greece!" he swore angrily. "Calves
 bawling their heads off in the corral, and you squalling that whiny stuff
 you call music in the house?home's sure a hell of a happy place! I'm
 going to town. You don't want to leave the place till I come back?I
 want those calves looked after." He seemed to consider something mentally,
 and then added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I'm not back before they quit bawling, you can turn 'em down in the
 river field with the rest. You know when they're weaned and ready to
 settle down. Don't feed 'em too much hay, like you did that other bunch;
 just give 'em what they need; you don't have to pile the corral full. And
 don't keep 'em shut up an hour longer than necessary."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val nodded her head to show that she heard, and went on playing. There was
 seldom any pretense of good feeling between them now. She tuned the violin
 to minor, and poised the bow over the strings, in some doubt as to her
 memory of a serenade she wanted to try next.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I have Polycarp take the team and haul up some wood from the
 river?" she asked carelessly. "We're nearly out again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>I</i> don't care?if he happens along." He turned and went
 out, his mind turning eagerly to the town and what it could give him in
 the way of pleasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val, still sitting in the doorway, saw him ride away up the grade and
 disappear over the brow of the hill. The dusk was settling softly upon the
 land, so that his figure was but a vague shape. She was alone again; she
 rather liked being alone, now that she had no longer a blind, unreasoning
 terror of the empty land. She had her thoughts and her work; the presence
 of Manley was merely an unpleasant interruption to both.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some time in the night she heard the lowing of a cow somewhere near. She
 wondered dreamily what it could be doing in the coulee, and went to sleep
 again. The five calves were all bawling in a chorus of complaint against
 their forced separation from their mothers, and the deeper, throaty tones
 of the cow mingled not inharmoniously with the sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Range cattle were not permitted in the coulee, and when by chance they
 found a broken panel in the fence and strayed down there, Val drove them
 out; afoot, usually, with shouts and badly aimed stones to accelerate
 their lumbering pace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After she had eaten her breakfast in the morning she went out to
 investigate. Beyond the corral, her nose thrust close against the rails, a
 cow was bawling dismally. Inside, in much the same position, its tail
 waving a violent signal of its owner's distress, a calf was clamoring
 hysterically for its mother and its mother's milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val sympathized with them both; but the cow did not belong in the coulee,
 and she gathered two or three small stones and went around where she could
 frighten her away from the fence without, however, exposing herself too
 recklessly to her uncertain temper. Cows at weaning time did sometimes
 object to being driven from their calves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shoo! Go on away from there!" Val raised a stone and poised it
 threateningly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cow turned and regarded her, wild-eyed. It backed a step or two,
 evidently uncertain of its next move.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go on away!" Val was just on the point of throwing the rock, when she
 dropped it unheeded to the ground and stared. "Why, you?you?why?the
 <i>idea!</i>" She turned slowly white. Certain things must filter to the
 understanding through amazement and disbelief; it took Val a minute or two
 to grasp the significance of what she saw. By the time she did grasp it,
 her knees were beading weakly beneath the weight of her body. She put out
 a groping hand and caught at the corner of the corral to keep herself from
 falling. And she stared and stared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It?oh, surely not!" she whispered, protesting against her
 understanding. She gave a little sob that had no immediate relation to
 tears. "Surely?<i>surely</i>?not!" It was of no use;
 understanding came, and came clearly, pitilessly. Many things?trifles,
 all of them?to which she had given no thought at the time, or which
 she had forgotten immediately, came back to her of their own accord;
 things she tried <i>not</i> to remember.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cow stared at her for a minute, and, when she made no hostile move,
 turned its attention back to its bereavement. Once again it thrust its
 moist muzzle between two rails, gave a preliminary, vibrant <i>mmm?mmmmm?m</i>,
 and then, with a spasmodic heaving of ribs and of flank, burst into a
 long-drawn <i>baww?aw?aw?aw</i>, which rose rapidly in a
 tremulous crescendo and died to a throaty rumbling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val started nervously, though her eyes were fixed upon the cow and she
 knew the sound was coming. It served, however, to release her from the
 spell of horror which had gripped her. She was still white, and when she
 moved she felt intolerably heavy, so that her feet dragged; but she was no
 longer dazed. She went slowly around to the gate, reached up wearily and
 undid the chain fastening, opened the gate slightly, and went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Four of the calves were huddled together for mutual comfort in a corner.
 They were blatting indefatigably. Val went over to where the fifth one
 still stood beside the fence, as near the cow as it could get, and threw a
 small stone, that bounced off the calf's rump. The calf jumped and ran
 aimlessly before her until it reached the half-open gate, when it dodged
 out, as if it could scarcely believe its own good fortune. Before Val
 could follow it outside, it was nuzzling rapturously its mother, and the
 cow was contorting her body so that she could caress her offspring with
 her tongue, while she rumbled her satisfaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val closed and fastened the gate carefully, and went back to where the cow
 still lingered. With her lips drawn to a thin, colorless line, she drove
 her across the coulee and up the hill, the calf gamboling close alongside.
 When they had gone out of sight, up on the level, Val turned back and went
 slowly to the house. She stood for a minute staring stupidly at it and at
 the coulee, went in and gazed around her with that blankness which follows
 a great mental shock. After a minute she shivered, threw up her hands
 before her face, and dropped, a pitiful, sorrowing heap of quivering
 rebellion, upon the couch.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIX. KENT'S CONFESSION
 </h2>
 <p>
 Polycarp Jenks came ambling into the coulee, rapped perfunctorily upon the
 door-casing, and entered the kitchen as one who feels perfectly at home,
 and sure of his welcome; as was not unfitting, considering the fact that
 he had "chored around" for Val during the last year, and longer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anybody to home?" he called, seeing the front door shut tight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a stir within, and Val, still pale, and with an almost furtive
 expression in her eyes, opened the door and looked out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's you, Polycarp," she said lifelessly. "Is there anything?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter? Sick? You look kinda peaked and frazzled out. I met
 Man las' night, and he told me you needed wood; I thought I'd ride over
 and see. By granny, you do look bad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just a headache," Val evaded, shrinking back guiltily. "Just do whatever
 there is to do, Polycarp. I think?I don't believe the chickens have
 had anything to eat to-day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Them headaches are sure a fright; they're might' nigh as bad as
 rheumatiz, when they hit you hard. You jest go back and lay down, and I'll
 look around and see what they is to do. Any idee when Man's comin' back?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No." Val brought the word out with an involuntary sharpness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I reckon not. I hear him and Fred De Garmo come might' near havin' a
 fight las' night. Blumenthall was tellin' me this mornin'. Fred's quit the
 Double Diamond, I hear. He's got himself appointed dep'ty stock inspector?and
 how he managed to git the job is more 'n I can figure out. They say he's
 all swelled up over it?got his headquarters in town, you know, and
 seems he got to lordin' it over Man las' night, and I guess if somebody
 hadn't stopped 'em they'd of been a mix-up, all right. Man wasn't in no
 shape to fight?he'd been drinkin' pretty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?well, just do whatever there is to do, Polycarp. The horses are
 in the upper pasture, I think?if you want to haul wood." She closed
 the door?gently, but with exceeding firmness, and, Polycarp took the
 hint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Women is queer," he muttered, as he left the house. "Now, she knows Man
 drinks like a fish?and she knows everybody else knows it?but
 if you so much as mention sech a thing, why?" He waggled his head
 disapprovingly and proceeded, in his habitually laborious manner, to take
 a chew of tobacco. "No matter how much they may know a thing is so, if it
 don't suit 'em you can't never git 'em to stand right up and face it out?seems
 like, by granny, it comes natural to 'em to make believe things is
 different. Now, she knows might' well she can't fool <i>me</i>. I've hearn
 Man swear at her like?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He reached the corral, and his insatiable curiosity turned his thoughts
 into a different channel. He inspected the four calves gravely, wondered
 audibly where Man had found them, and how the round-up came to miss them,
 and criticized his application of the brand; in the opinion of Polycarp,
 Manley either burned too deep or not deep enough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Time that line-backed heifer scabs off, you can't tell what's on her," he
 asserted, expectorating solemnly before he turned away to his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Prom a window, Val watched him with cold terror. Would he suspect? Or was
 there anything to suspect? "It's silly?it's perfectly idiotic," she
 told herself impatiently; "but if he hangs around that corral another
 minute, I shall scream!" She watched until she saw him mount his horse and
 ride off toward the upper pasture. Then she went out and began
 apathetically picking seed pods off her sweet-peas, which the early frosts
 had spared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Head better?" called Polycarp, half an hour later, when he went rattling
 past the house with the wagon, bound for the river bottom where they got
 their supply of wood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little," Val answered inattentively, without looking at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was while Polycarp was after the wood, and while she was sitting upon
 the edge of the porch, listlessly arranging and rearranging a handful of
 long-stemmed blossoms, that Kent galloped down the hill and up to the
 gate. She saw him coming and set her teeth hard together. She did not want
 to see Kent just then; she did not want to see anybody.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent, however, wanted to see her. It seemed to him at least a month since
 he had had a glimpse of her, though it was no more than half that time. He
 watched her covertly while he came up the path. His mind, all the way over
 from the Wishbone, had been very clear and very decided. He had a certain
 thing to tell her, and a certain thing to do; he had thought it all out
 during the nights when he could not sleep and the days when men called him
 surly, and there was no going back, no reconsideration of the matter. He
 had been telling himself that, over and over, ever since the house came
 into view and he saw her sitting there on the porch. She would probably
 want to argue, and perhaps she would try to persuade him, but it would be
 absolutely useless; absolutely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, hello!" he cried, with more than his usual buoyancy of manner?because
 he knew he must hurt her later on. "Hello, Madam Authoress. Why this
 haughty air? This stuckupiness? Shall I get a ladder and climb up where
 you can hear me say howdy?" He took off his hat and slapped her gently
 upon the top of her head with it. "Come out of the fog!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?I wish you wouldn't!" She glanced up at him so briefly that he
 caught only a flicker of her yellow-brown eyes, and went on fumbling her
 flowers. Kent stood and looked down at her for a moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mad?" he inquired cheerfully. "Say, you look awfully savage. On the dead,
 you do. What do <i>you</i> care if they sent it back? You had all the fun
 of writing it?and you know it's a dandy. Please smile. <i>Pretty</i>
 please!" he wheedled. It was not the first time he had discovered her in a
 despondent mood, nor the first time he had bantered and badgered her out
 of her gloom. Presently it dawned upon him that this was more serious; he
 had never seen her quite so colorless or so completely without spirit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sick, pal?" he asked gently, sitting down beside her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No-o?I suppose not." Val bit her lips, as soon as she had spoken,
 to check their quivering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what is it? I wish you'd tell me. I came over here full of
 something I had to tell you?but I can't, now; not while you're like
 this." He watched her yearningly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I can't tell you. It's nothing." Val jerked a sweet-pea viciously
 from its stem, pressed her hand against her mouth, and turned reluctantly
 toward him. "What was it you came to tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched her narrowly. "I'll gamble you're down in the mouth about
 something hubby has said or done. You needn't tell me?but I just
 want to ask you if you think it's worth while? You needn't tell me that,
 either. You know blamed well it ain't. He can't deal you any more misery
 than you let him hand out; you want to keep that in mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another blossom was demolished. "What was it you came to tell me?" she
 repeated steadily, though she did not look at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing much. I'm going to leave the country, is all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kent!" After a minute she forced another word out. "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent regarded her somberly. "You better think twice before you ask me
 that," he warned; "because I ain't much good at beating all around the
 bush. If you ask me again, I'll tell you?and I'm liable to tell you
 without any frills." He drew a hard breath. "So I'd advise you not to
 ask," he finished, half challengingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val placed a pale lavender blossom against a creamy white one, and held
 the two up for inspection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When are you going?" she asked evenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know exactly?in a day or so. Saturday, maybe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She hesitated over the flowers in her lap, and selected a pink one, which
 she tried with the white and the lavender.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And?<i>why</i> are you going?" she asked him deliberately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent stared at her fixedly. A faint, pink flush was creeping into her
 cheeks. He watched it deepen, and knew that his silence was filling her
 with uneasiness. He wondered how much she guessed of what he was going to
 say, and how much it would mean to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?I'll tell you why, fast enough." His tone was grim. "I'm
 going to leave the country because I can't stay any longer?not while
 you're in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?Kent!" She seemed inexpressibly shocked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," he went on relentlessly, "what you think a man's made of,
 anyhow. And I don't know what <i>you</i> think of this pal business; I
 know what I think: It's a mighty good way to drive a man crazy. I've had
 about all of it I can stand, if you want to know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry, if you don't?if you can't be friends any longer," she
 said, and he winced to see how her eyes filled with tears. "But, of
 course, if you can't?if it bores you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent seized her arm, a bit roughly, "Have I got to come right out and tell
 you, in plain English, that I?that it's because I'm so deep in love
 with you I can't. If you only knew what it's cost me this last year?to
 play the game and not play it too hard! What do you think a man's made of?
 Do you think a man can care for a woman, like I care for you, and?Do
 you think he wants to be just pals? And stand back and watch some drunken
 brute abuse her?and never?Here!" His voice grew testier.
 "Don't do that?don't! I didn't want to hurt you?God knows I
 didn't want to hurt you!" He threw his seem around her shoulders and
 pulled her toward him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't?pal, I'm a brute, I guess, like all the rest of the male
 humans. I don't mean to be?it's the way I'm made. When a woman means
 so much to me that I can't think of anything else, day or night, and get
 to counting days and scheming to see her?why?being friends?like
 we've been?is like giving a man a teaspoon of milk and water when
 he's starving to death, and thinking that oughta do. But I shouldn't have
 let it hurt you. I tried to stand for it, little woman. These were times
 when I just had to fight myself not to take you up in my arms and carry
 you of and keep you. You must admit," he argued, smiling rather wanly,
 "that, considering how I've felt about it, I've done pretty tolerable well
 up till now. You don't?you never will know how much it's cost. Why,
 my nerves are getting so raw I can't stand anything any more. That's why
 I'm going. I don't want to hang around till I do something?foolish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took his arm away from her shoulders and moved farther off; he was not
 sure how far he might trust himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I thought you cared?or if there was anything I could do for
 you," he ventured, after a moment, "why, it would be different. But?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val lifted her head and turned to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is something?or there was?or?oh, I can't think
 any more! I suppose"?doubtfully?"if you feel as you say you
 do, why?it would be?wicked to stay. But you don't; you must
 just imagine it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, all right," Kent interpolated ironically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if you go away?" She got up and stood before him, breathing
 unevenly, in little gasps. "Oh, you mustn't go away! Please don't go! I?there's
 something terrible happened?oh, Kent, I need you! I can't tell you
 what it is?it's the most horrible thing I ever heard of! You can't
 imagine anything more horrible, Kent!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She twisted her fingers together nervously, and the blossoms dropped, one
 by one, on the ground. "If you go," she pleaded, "I won't have a friend in
 the country, not a real friend. And?and I never needed a friend as
 much as I do now, and you mustn't go. I?I can't let you go!" It was
 like her hysterical fear of being left alone after the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent eyed her keenly. He knew there must have been something to put her
 into this state?something more than his own rebellion. He felt
 suddenly ashamed of his weakness in giving way?in telling her how it
 was with him. The faint, far-off chuckle of a wagon came to his ears. He
 turned impatiently toward the sound. Polycarp was driving up the coulee
 with a load of wood; already he was nearing the gate which opened into the
 lower field. Kent stood up, reached out, and caught Val by the hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on into the house," he said peremptorily. "Polly's coming, and you
 don't want him goggling and listening. And I want you," he added, when he
 had led her inside and closed the door, "to tell me what all this is
 about. There's something, and I want to know what. If it concerns you,
 then it concerns me a whole lot, too. And what concerns me I'm going to
 find out about?what is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val sat down, got up immediately, and crossed the room aimlessly to sit in
 another chair. She pressed her palms tightly against both cheeks, drew in
 her breath as if she were going to speak, and, after all, said nothing.
 She looked out of the window, pushing back the errant strand of hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't?I don't know how to tell you," she began desperately. "It's
 too horrible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe it is?I don't know what you'd call too horrible; I kinda
 think it wouldn't be what I'd tack those words to. Anyway?what is
 it?" He went close, and he spoke insistently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took a long breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley's a thief!" She jerked the words out like as automaton. They were
 not, evidently, the Words she had meant to speak, for she seemed
 frightened afterward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's it!" Kent made a sound which was not far from a snort. "Well,
 what about it? What's he done? How did you find it out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val straightened in the chair and gazed up at him. Once more her tawny
 eyes gave him a certain shock, as if he had never before noticed them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all our neighbors have done for him," she cried bitterly; "after
 giving him hay, when his was burned and he couldn't buy any; after
 building stables, and corral, and?everything they did?the
 kindest, best neighbors a man ever had?oh, it's too shameful for
 utterance! I might forgive it?I might, only for that. The?the
 ingratitude! It's too despicable?too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent laid a steadying hand upon her arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but what is it?" he interrupted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val shook off his hand unconsciously, impatient of any touch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, the bare deed itself?well, it's rather petty, too?and
 cheap." Her voice became full of contempt. "It was the calves. He brought
 home five last night?five that hadn't been branded last spring.
 Where he found them <i>I</i> don't know?I didn't care enough about
 it to ask. He had been drinking, I think; I can usually tell?and he
 often carries a bottle in his pocket, as I happen to know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he had me make a fire and heat the iron for him, and he branded
 them?last night; he was very touchy about it when I asked him what
 was his hurry. I think now it was a stupid thing for him to do. And?well,
 in the night, some time, I heard a cow bawling around close, and this
 morning I went out to drive her away; the fence is always down somewhere?I
 suppose she found a place to get through. So I went out to drive her
 away." Her eyes dropped, as if she were making a confession of her own
 misdeed. She clenched her hands tightly in her lap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?it was a Wishbone cow." After all, she said it very quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The devil it was!" Kent had been prepared for something of the sort; but,
 nevertheless, he started when he heard his own outfit mentioned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. It was a Wishbone cow." Her voice was flat and monotonous. "He had
 stolen her calf. He had it in the corral, and he had branded it with his
 own brand?with a VP. <i>With my initials!</i>" she wailed suddenly,
 as if the thought had just struck her, and was intolerably bitter. "She
 had followed?had been hunting her calf; it was rather a little calf,
 smaller than the others. And it was crowded up against the fence, trying
 to get to her. There was no mistaking their relationship. I tried to think
 he had made a mistake; but it's of no use?I know he didn't. I know
 he <i>stole</i> that calf. And for all I know, the others, too. Oh, it's
 perfectly horrible to think of!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent could easily guess her horror of it, and he was sorry for her. But
 his mind turned instantly to the practical side of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?maybe it can be fixed up, if you feel so bad about it. Does
 Polycarp?did he see the cow hanging around?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val shook her head apathetically. "No?he didn't come till just a
 little while ago. That was this morning. And I drove her out of the coulee?her
 and her calf. They went off up over the hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent stood looking down at her rather stupidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You?<i>what?</i> What was it you did?" It seemed to him that
 something?some vital point of the story?had eluded him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I drove them away. I didn't think they ought to be permitted to hang
 around here." Her lips quivered again. "I?I didn't want to see him?get?into
 any trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You drove them away? Both of them?" Kent was frowning at her now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val sprang up and faced him, all a-tremble with indignation. "Certainly,
 both! <i>I'm</i> not a thief, Kent Burnett! When I knew?when there
 was no possible doubt?why, what, in Heaven's name, <i>could</i> I
 do? It wasn't Manley's calf. I turned it loose to go back where it
 belonged."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With a VP on its ribs!" Kent was staring at her curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't care! Fifty VP's couldn't make the calf Manley's. If
 anybody came and saw that cow, why?" Val looked at him rafter
 pityingly, as if she could not quite understand how he could even question
 her upon that point. "And, after all," she added forlornly, "he's my
 husband. I couldn't?I had to do what I could to shield him?just
 for sake of the past, I suppose. Much as I despise him, I can't forget
 that?that I cared once. It's because I wanted your advice that I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pity you didn't get it sooner, then! Can't you see what you've
 done? Why, think a minute! A VP calf running with a Wishbone cow?why,
 it's?you couldn't advertise Man as a rustler any better if you
 tried. The first fellow that runs onto that cow and calf?well, he
 won't need to do any guessing?he'll <i>know</i>. It's a ticket to
 Deer Lodge?that VP calf. Now do you see?" He turned away to the
 window and stood looking absently at the brown hillside, his hands thrust
 deep into his pockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And there's Fred De Garmo, with his new job, ranging around the country
 just aching to cinch somebody and show his authority. It's a matter of
 days almost. He'd like nothing better than to get a whack at Man, even if
 the Wishbone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Outside, they could hear Polycarp throwing the wood off the wagon; knowing
 him as they did, they knew, it would not be long before he found an excuse
 for coming into the house. He had more than once evinced a good deal of
 interest in Kent's visits there, and shown an unmistakable desire to know
 what they were talking about. They had never paid much attention to him;
 but now even Val felt a vague uneasiness lest he overhear. She had been
 sitting, her face buried in her arms, crushed beneath the knowledge of
 what she had done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't worry, little woman." Kent went over and passed his hand lightly
 over her hair. "You did what looked to you to be the right thing?the
 honest thing. And the chances are he'd get caught before long, anyhow. I
 don't reckon this is the first time he's done it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh-h?but to think?to think that <i>I</i> should do it?when
 I wanted to save him! He?Kent, I despise him?he has killed all
 the love I ever felt for him?killed it over and over?but if
 anybody finds that calf, and?and if they?Kent, I shall go
 crazy if I have to feel that <i>I</i> sent him?to?prison. To
 think of him?shut up there?and to know that I did it?I
 can't bear it!" She caught his arm. She pressed her forehead against it.
 "Kent, isn't there some way to get it back? If I should find it?and?and
 shoot it?and pay the Wishbone what it's worth?oh, <i>any</i>
 amount?or shoot the cow?or?" she raised her face
 imploringly to his?"tell me, pal?or I shall go stark, raving
 mad!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp came into the kitchen, and, from the sound, he was trying to
 enter as unobtrusively as possible, even to the extent of walking on his
 toes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go see what that darned old sneak wants," Kent commanded in an undertone.
 "Act as if nothing happened?if you can." He watched anxiously, while
 she drew a long breath, pressed her hands hard against her cheeks, closed
 her lips tightly, and then, with something like composure, went quietly to
 the door and threw it open. Polycarp was standing very close to it, on the
 other side. He drew back a step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wondered if I better git another load, now I've got the team hooked
 up," he began in his rasping, nasal voice, his slitlike eyes peering
 inquisitively into the room. "Hello, Kenneth?I <i>thought</i> that
 was your horse standin' outside. Or would you rather I cut up a pile? I
 dunno but what I'll have to go t'town t'-morrerr or next day?mebby I
 better cut you some wood, hey? If Man ain't likely to be home, mebby?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think, Polycarp, well have a storm soon. So it would be good policy to
 haul another load, don't you think? I can manage very well with what there
 is cut until Manley returns; and there are always small branches that I
 can break easily with the axe. I really think it would be safer to have
 another load hauled now while we can. Don't you think so?" Val even
 managed to smile at him. "If my head wasn't so bad," she added
 deceitfully, "I should be tempted to go along, just for a dose sight of
 the river. Mr. Burnett is going directly?perhaps I may walk down
 later on. But you had better not wait?I shouldn't want to keep you
 working till dark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp, eying her and Kent, and the room in all its details, forced his
 hand into his trousers pocket, brought up his battered plug of tobacco and
 pried off a piece, which he rolled into his left cheek with his tongue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jest as you say," he surrendered, though it was perfectly plain that he
 would much prefer to cut wood and so be able to see all that went on, even
 though he was denied the gratification of hearing what they said. He
 waited a moment, but Val turned away, and even had the audacity to close
 the door upon his unfinished reply. He listened for a moment, his head
 craned forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Purty kinda goings-on!" he mumbled. "Time Man had a flea put in 'is ear,
 by granny, if he don't want to lose that yeller-eyed wife of hisn." To
 Polycarp, a closed door?when a man and woman were alone upon the
 other side?could mean nothing but surreptitious kisses and the like.
 He went stumbling out and drove away down the coulee, his head turning
 automatically so that his eyes were constantly upon the house; from his
 attitude, as Kent saw him through the window Polycarp expected an
 explosion, at the very least. His outraged virtue vested itself in one
 more sentence; "Purty blamed nervy, by granny?to go 'n' shut the
 door right in m' face!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Inside the room, Val stood for a minute with her back against the door, as
 if she half feared Polycarp would break in and drag her secret from her.
 When she heard him leave the kitchen she drew a long breath, eloquent in
 itself: when the rattle of the wagon came to them there, she left the door
 and went slowly across the room until she stood close to Kent. The
 interruption had steadied them both. Her voice was a constrained calm when
 she spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 {Illustration: To draw the red hot spur across the fresh VP did not take
 long}
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?is there anything I can do? Because I suppose every minute is
 dangerous."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent kept his eyes upon the departing Polycarp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's nothing you can do, no. Maybe I can do something; soon as that
 granny gossip is outa sight, I'll go and round up that cow and calf?if
 somebody hasn't beaten me to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val looked at him with a certain timid helplessness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Will you?won't it be against the law if you?if you kill
 it?" She grew slightly excited again. "Kent, you shall not get into any
 trouble for?for his sake! If it comes to a choice, why?let him
 suffer for his crime. You shall not!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent turned his head slowly and gazed down at her. "Don't run away with
 the idea I'm doing it for him," he told her distinctly. "I love Man
 Fleetwood like I love a wolf. But if that VP calf catches him up, you'd
 fight your head over it, God only knows how long. I know you! You'd think
 so much about the part you played that you'd wind up by forgetting
 everything else. You'd get to thinking of him as a martyr, maybe! No?it's
 for you. I kinda got you into this, you recollect? If I'd let you see Man
 drank, that day, you'd never have married him; I know that now. So I'm
 going to get you out of it. My side of the question can wait."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stared up at him with a grave understanding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you know what I said?you won't do anything that can make you
 trouble?won't you tell me, Kent, what you're going to do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had already started to the door, but he stopped and smiled
 reassuringly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing so fierce. If I can find 'em, I aim to bar out that VP. Sabe?"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XX. A BLOTCHED BRAND
 </h2>
 <p>
 At the brow of the hill, which was the western rim of the coulee, Kent
 turned and waved a farewell to Val, watching him wistfully from the
 kitchen door. She had wanted to go along; she had almost cried to go and
 help, but Kent would not permit her?and beneath the unpleasantness
 of denying her anything, there had been a certain primitive joy in feeling
 himself master of the situation and of her actions; for that one time it
 was as if she belonged to him. At the last he had accepted the field
 glasses, which she insisted upon lending him, and now he was tempted to
 take them from their worn, leathern case and focus them upon her face,
 just for the meager satisfaction of one more look at her. But he rode on,
 oat of sight, for the necessity which drove him forth did not permit much
 loitering if he would succeed in what he had set out to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Personally he would have felt no compunctions whatever about letting the
 calf go, a walking advertisement of Manley's guilt. It seemed to him a
 sort of grim retribution, and no more than he deserved. He had not
 exaggerated his sentiments when he intimated plainly to her his hatred of
 Manley, and he agreed with her that the fellow was making a despicable
 return for the kindness his neighbors had always shown him. No doubt he
 had stolen from the Double Diamond as well as the Wishbone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once Kent pulled up, half minded to go back and let events shape
 themselves without any interference from him. But there was Val?women
 were so queer about such things. It seemed to Kent that, if any man had
 caused him as much misery as Manley had caused Val, he would not waste
 much time worrying over him, if he tangled himself up with his own
 misdeeds. However, Val wanted that bit of evidence covered up; so, while
 Kent did not approve, he went at the business with his customary
 thoroughness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The field glasses were a great convenience. More than once they saved him
 the trouble of riding a mile or so to inspect a small bunch of stock.
 Nevertheless, he rode for several hours before, just at sundown, he
 discovered the cow feeding alone with her calf in a shallow depression
 near the rough country next the river. They were wild, and he ran them out
 of the hollow and up on high ground before he managed to drop his loop
 over the calf's head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You sure are a dandy-fine sign-post, all right," he observed, and grinned
 down at the staring VP brand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pity you can't be left that way." He glanced cautiously around him
 at the great, empty prairie. A mile or two away, a lone horseman was
 loping leisurely along, evidently bound for the Double Diamond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say?this is kinda public," Kent complained to the calf. "Let's you
 and me go down outa sight for a minute." He started off toward the hollow,
 dragging the calf, a protesting bundle of stiffened muscles pulling
 against the rope. The cow, shaking her head in a halfhearted defiance,
 followed. Kent kept an uneasy eye upon the horseman, and hoped fervently
 the fellow was absorbed in meditation and, would not glance in his
 direction. Once he was almost at the point of turning the calf loose; for
 barring out brands, even illegal brands, is justly looked upon with
 disfavor, to say the least.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down in the hollow, which Kent reached with a sigh of relief, he
 dismounted and hastily started a little fire on a barren patch of ground
 beneath a jutting sandstone ledge. The calf, tied helpless, lay near by,
 and the cow hovered close, uneasy, but lacking courage for a rush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent laid hand upon his saddle, hesitated, and shook his head; he might
 need it in a hurry, and cinch ring takes time both in the removal and the
 replacement?and is vitally important withal. His knife he had lost
 on the last round-up. He scowled at the necessity, lifted his heel, and
 took off a spur. "And if that darned ginny don't get too blamed curious
 and cone fogging over this way?" He spoke the phrase aloud, out of
 the middle of a mental arrangement of the chance he was taking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To heat the spur red-hot, draw it across the fresh VP again and again, and
 finally drag it crisscross once or twice to make assurance an absolute
 certainty, did not take long. Kent was particular about not wasting any
 seconds. The calf stopped its dismal blatting, and when Kent released it
 and coiled his rope, it jumped up and ran for its life, the cows ambling
 solicitously at its heels. Kent kicked the dirt over the fire, eyed it
 sharply a moment to make sure it was perfectly harmless, mounted in haste,
 and rode up the sloping side down, which he had come. Just under the top
 of the slope, he peeked anxiously out over the prairie, ducked
 precipitately, and went clattering away down the hollow to the farther
 side; dodged around a spur of rocks, forced his horse down over a wicked
 jumble of boulders to level land below, and rode as if a hangman's noose
 were the penalty for delay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the river?which he did after many windings and
 turnings?he got off and washed his spur, scrubbing it diligently
 with sand in an effort to remove the traces of fire. When the evidence was
 at least less conspicuous, he put it on his heel and jogged down the river
 bank quite innocently, inwardly thankful over his escape. He had certainly
 done nothing wrong; but one sometimes finds it rather awkward to be forced
 into an explanation of a perfectly righteous deed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I'd been stealing that calf, I'd never have been crazy enough to take
 such a long chance," he mused, and laughed a little. "I'll bet Fred
 thought he was due to grab a rustler right in the act?only he was a
 little bit slow about making up his mind; deputy stock inspectors had
 oughta think quicker than that?he was just about five minutes too
 deliberate. I'll gamble he's scratching his head, right now, over that
 blotched brand, trying to <i>sabe</i> the play?which he won't, not
 in a thousand years!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave the reins a twitch and began to climb through the dusk to the
 lighter hilltop, at a point just east of Cold Spring Coulee. At the top he
 put the spurs to his horse and headed straight as might be for the
 Wishbone ranch. He would like to have told Val of his success, but he was
 afraid Manley might be there, or Polycarp; it was wise always to avoid
 Polycarp Jenks, if one had anything to conceal from his fellows.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXI. VAL DECIDES
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was the middle of the next forenoon when Manley came riding home,
 sullen from drink and a losing game of poker, which had kept him all night
 at the table, and at sunrise sent him forth in the mood which meets a
 grievance more than half-way. He did not stop at the house, though he saw
 Val through the open door; he did not trouble to speak to her, even, but
 rode on to the stable, stopping at the corral to look over the fence at
 the calves, still bawling sporadically between half-hearted nibblings at
 the hay which Polycarp had thrown in to them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just at first he did not notice anything wrong, but soon a vague disquiet
 seized him, and he frowned thoughtfully at the little group. Something
 puzzled him; but his brain, fogged with whisky and loss of sleep, and the
 reaction from hours of concentration upon the game, could not quite grasp
 the thing that troubled him. In a moment, however, he gave an inarticulate
 bellow, wheeled about, and rode back to the house. He threw himself from
 the horse almost before it stopped, and rushed into the kitchen. Val,
 ironing one of her ruffled white aprons, looked up quickly, turned rather
 pale, and then stiffened perceptibly for the conflict that was coming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's only four calves in the corral?and I brought in five.
 Where's the other one?" He came up and stood quite close to her?so
 close that Val took a step backward. He did not speak loud, but there was
 something in his tone, in his look, that drove the little remaining color
 from her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley," she said, with a catch of the breath, "why did you do that
 horrible thing? What devil possessed you? I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I asked you 'where is that other calf'? Where is it? There's only four. I
 brought in five." His very calmness was terrifying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val threw back her head, and her eyes were?as they frequently became
 in moments of stress?yellow, inscrutable, like the eyes of a lion in
 a cage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you brought in five. One of the five, at least, you?stole. You
 put your brand, Manley Fleetwood, on a calf that did not belong to you; it
 belonged to the Wishbone, and you know it. I have learned many
 disagreeable things about you, Manley, in the past two years; yesterday
 morning I learned that you were a <i>thief</i>. Ah-h?I despise you!
 Stealing from the very men who helped you?the men to whom you owe
 nothing but gratitude and?and friendship! Have you no manhood
 whatever? Besides being weak and shiftless, are you a criminal as well? <i>How</i>
 can you be so utterly lacking in?in common decency, even?" She eyed
 him as she would look at some strange monster in a museum about which she
 was rather curious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I asked you where that other calf is?and you'd better tell me!" It
 was the tone which goes well with a knife thrust or a blow. But the
 contempt in Val's face did not change.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you'll have to hunt for it if you want it. The cow?a Wishbone
 cow, mind you!?came and claimed it; I let her have it. No stolen
 goods can remain on this ranch with my knowledge, Manley Fleetwood. Please
 remember?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you turned it out, did you? You turned it out?" He had her by the
 throat, shaking her as a puppy shakes a purloined shoe. "I could?<i>kill</i>
 you for that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manley! Ah-h-h?" It was not pleasant?that gurgling cry, as
 she straggled to get free.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had the look of a maniac as he pressed his fingers into her throat and
 glared down into her purpling face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With a sudden impulse he cast her limp form violently from him. She struck
 against a chair, fell from that to the floor, and lay a huddled heap, her
 crisp, ruffled skirt just giving a glimpse of tiny, half-worn slippers,
 her yellow hair fallen loose and hiding her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stared down at her, but he felt no remorse?she had jeopardized
 his liberty, his standing among men. A cold horror caught him when he
 thought of the calf turned loose on the range, his brand on its ribs. He
 rushed in a panic from the kitchen, flung himself into the saddle, and
 went off across the coulee, whipping both sides of his horse. She had not
 told him?indeed, he had not asked her?which way the cow had
 gone, but instinctively he rode to the west, the direction from which he
 had driven the calves. One thought possessed him utterly; he must find
 that calf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he rode here and there, doubling and turning to search every feeding
 herd he glimpsed, fearing to face the possibility of failure and its
 inevitable consequence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cat with the white spots on its sides?Val called her Mary
 Arabella, for some whimsical reason?came into the kitchen, looked
 inquiringly at the huddled figure upon the floor, gave a faint mew, and
 went slowly up, purring and arching her back; she snuffed a moment at
 Val's hair, then settled herself in the hollow of Val's arm, and curled
 down for a nap. The sun, sliding up to midday, shone straight in upon them
 through the open door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp Jenks, riding that way in obedience to some obscure impulse,
 lifted his hand to give his customary tap-tap before he walked in; saw Val
 lying there, and almost fell headlong into the room in his haste and
 perturbation. It looked very much as if he had at last stumbled upon the
 horrible tragedy which was his one daydream. To be an eyewitness of a
 murder, and to be able to tell the tale afterward with minute, horrifying
 detail?that, to Polycarp, would make life really worth living. He
 shuffled over to Val, pushed aside the mass of yellow hair, turned her
 head so that he could look into her face, saw at once the bruised marks
 upon her throat, and stood up very straight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Foul play has been done here!" he exclaimed melodramatically, eying the
 cat sternly. "Murder?that's what it is, by granny?a foul
 murder!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The victim of the foul murder stirred slightly. Polycarp started and bent
 over her again, somewhat disconcerted, perhaps, but more humanly anxious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mis' Fleetwood?Mis' Fleetwood! You hurt? It's Polycarp Jenks
 talkin' to you!" He hesitated, pushed the cat away, lifted Val with some
 difficulty, and carried her into the front room and deposited her on the
 couch. Then he hurried after some water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come might' nigh bein' a murder, by granny?from the marks on 'er
 neck?come might' nigh, all right!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sprinkled water lavishly upon her face, bethought him of a possible
 whisky flask in the haystack, and ran every step of the way there and
 back. He found a discarded bottle with a very little left in it, and
 forced the liquor down her throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That'll fetch ye if anything will?<i>he-he!</i>" he mumbled,
 tittering from sheer excitement. Beyond a very natural desire to do what
 he could for her, he was extremely anxious to bring her to her senses, so
 that he could hear what had happened, and how it had happened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Betche Man got jealous of her'n Kenneth?by granny, I betche that's
 how it come about?hey? Feelin' better, Mis' Fleetwood?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val had opened her eyes and was looking at him rather stupidly. There was
 a bruise upon her head, as well as upon her throat. She had been stunned,
 and her wits came back slowly. When she recognized Polycarp, she tried
 ineffectually to sit up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?he?is?he?gone?" Her voice was husky, her speech
 labored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man, you mean? He's gone, yes. Don't you be afeared?not whilst I'm
 here, by granny! How came it he done this to ye?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val was still staring at him bewilderedly. Polycarp repeated his question
 three times before the blank look left her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?turned the calf?out?the cow?came and?claimed
 it?Manley?" She lifted her hand as if it were very, very
 heavy, and fumbled at her throat. "Manley?when I told him?he
 was a?thief?" She dropped her hand wearily to her side and
 closed her eyes, as if the sight of Polycarp's face, so close to hers and
 so insatiably curious and eager and cunning, was more than she could bear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go away," she commanded, after a minute or two. "I'm?all right.
 It's nothing. I fell. It was?the heat. Thank you?so much?"
 She opened her eyes and saw him there still. She looked at him gravely,
 speculatively. She waved her hand toward the bedroom. "Get me my hand
 glass?in there on the dresser," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had tiptoed in and got it for her, she lifted it up slowly, with
 both hands, until she could see her throat. There were distinct, telltale
 marks upon the tender flesh?unmistakable finger prints. She shivered
 and dropped the glass to the floor. But she stared steadily up at
 Polycarp, and after a moment she spoke with a certain fierceness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Polycarp Jenks, don't ever tell?about those marks. I?I don't
 want any one to know. When?after a while?I want to think first?perhaps
 you can help me. Go away now?not away from the ranch, but?let
 me think. I'm all right?or I will be. Please go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp recognized that tone, however it might be hoarsened by bruised
 muscles and the shock of what she had suffered. He recognized also that
 look in her eyes; he had always obeyed that look and that tone?he
 obeyed them now, though with visible reluctance. He sat down in the
 kitchen to wait, and while he waited he chewed tobacco incessantly, and
 ruminated upon the mystery which lay behind the few words Val had first
 spoken, before she realized just what it was she was saying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a long, long while?so long that even Polycarp's patience was
 feeling the strain?Val opened the door and stood leaning weakly
 against the casing. Her throat was swathed in a piece of white silk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish, Polycarp, you'd get the team and hitch it to the light rig," she
 said. "I want to go to town, and I don't feel able to drive. Can you take
 me in? Can you spare the time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, certainly, I c'n take you in, Mis' Fleetwood. I was jest thinkn' it
 wa'n't safe for you out here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is perfectly safe," Val interrupted chillingly. "I am going because I
 Want to see Arline Hawley." She raised her hand to the bandage. "I have a
 sore throat," she stated, staring hard at him. Then, with one of her
 impulsive changes, she smiled wistfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll be my friend, Polycarp, won't you?" she pleaded. "I can trust you,
 I know, with my?secret. It is a secret?it <i>must</i> be a
 secret! I'll tell you the truth, Polycarp. It was Manley?he had been
 drinking again. He?we had a quarrel?about something. He didn't
 know what he was doing?he didn't mean to hurt me. But I fell?I
 struck my head; see, there is a great lump there." She pushed back her
 hair to show him the place. "So it's a secret?just between you and
 me, Polycarp Jenks!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, certainly, Mis' Fleetwood; don't you be the least mite oneasy; I'm
 your friend?I always have been. A feller ain't to be held
 responsible when he's drinkin'?by granny, that's a fact, he ain't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," Val agreed laconically, "I suppose not. Let us go, then, as soon as
 we can, please. I'll stay overnight with Mrs. Hawley, and you can bring me
 back to-morrow, can't you? And you'll remember not to mention?anything,
 won't you, Polycarp?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp stood very straight and dignified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope, Mis' Fleetwood, you can always depend on Polycarp Jenks," he
 replied virtuously. "Your secret is safe with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val smiled?somewhat doubtfully, it is true?and let him go.
 "Maybe it is?I hope so," she sighed, as she turned away to dress for
 the trip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All through that long ride to town, Polycarp talked and talked and talked.
 He made surmises and waited openly to hear them confirmed or denied; he
 gave her advice; he told her everything he had ever heard about Manley, or
 had seen or knew from some other source; everything, that is, save what
 was good. The sums he had lost at poker, or had borrowed; the debts he
 owed to the merchants; the reputation he had for "talking big and doing
 little;" the trouble he had had with this man and that man; and what he
 did not know for a certainty he guessed at, and so kept the subject alive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 True, Val did not speak at all, except when he asked her how she felt.
 Then she would reply dully, "Pretty well, thank you, Polycarp." Invariably
 those were the words she used. Whenever he stole a furtive, sidelong
 glance at her, she was staring straight ahead at the great, undulating
 prairie with the brown ribbon, which was the trail, thrown carelessly
 across to the sky line.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Polycarp suspected that she did not see anything?she just stared
 with her eyes, while her thoughts were somewhere else. He was not even
 sure that she heard what he was saying. He thought she must be pretty
 sick, she was so pale, and she had such wide, purple rings under her eyes.
 Also, he rather resented her desire to keep her trouble a secret; he
 favored telling everybody, and organizing a party to go out and run Man
 Fleetwood out of the country, as the very mildest rebuke which the
 outraged community could give and remain self-respecting. He even fell
 silent daring the last three or four miles, while he dwelt longingly upon
 the keen pleasure there would be in leading such an expedition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll remember, Polycarp, not to speak of this?" Val urged abruptly when
 he drew up before the Hawley Hotel. "Not a hint, you know until?until
 I give you permission. You promised."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, certainly, Mis' Fleetwood. Certainly. Don't you be a mite oneasy."
 But the tone of Polycarp was dejected in the extreme.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And please be ready to drive me back in the morning. I should like to be
 at the ranch by noon, at the latest." With that she left him and went into
 the hotel.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXII. A FRIEND IN NEED
 </h2>
 <p>
 "And so," Val finished, rather apathetically, pushing back the fallen lock
 of hair, "it has come to that. I can't remain here and keep any shred of
 self-respect. All my life I've been taught to believe divorce a terrible
 thing?a crime, almost; now I think it is sometimes a crime <i>not</i>
 to be divorced. For months I have been coming slowly to a decision, so
 this is really not as sudden as it may seem to you. It is humiliating to
 be compelled to borrow money?but I would much rather ask you than
 any of my own people. My pride is going to suffer enough when I meet them,
 as it is; I can't let them know just how miserable and sordid a failure?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline gave an inarticulate snort, bent her scrawny body nearly double,
 and reached frankly into her stocking. She fumbled there a moment and
 straightened triumphantly, grasping a flat, buckskin bag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd feel like shakin' you if you went to anybody else but me," she
 declared, untying the bag. "I know what men is?Lord knows I see
 enough of 'em and their meanness?and if I can help a woman outa the
 clutches of one, I'm tickled to death to git the chancet. I ain't sayin'
 they're all of 'em bad?I c'n afford to give the devil his due and
 still say that men is the limit. The good ones is so durn scarce it ain't
 one woman in fifty lucky enough to git one. All I blame you for is stayin'
 with him as long as you have. I'd of quit long ago; I was beginnin' to
 think you never would come to your senses. But you had to fight that thing
 out for yourself; every woman has to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm glad you've woke up to the fact that Man Fleetwood didn't git a deed
 to you, body and soul, when he married you; you've been actin' as if you
 thought he had. And I'm glad you've got sense enough to pull outa the game
 when you know the best you can expect is the worst of it. There ain't no
 hope for Man Fleetwood; I seen that when he went back to drinkin' again
 after you was burnt out. I did think that would steady him down, but he
 ain't the kind that braces up when trouble hits him?he's the sort
 that stays down ruther than go to the trouble of gittin' up. He's hopeless
 now as a rotten egg, and has been for the last year. Here; you take the
 hull works, and if you need more, I can easy git it for you by sendin' in
 to the bank."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, but this is too much!" Val protested when she had counted the money.
 "You're so good?but really and truly, I won't need half?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline pushed away the proffered money impatiently. "How'n time are you
 goin' to tell how much you'll need? Lemme tell you, Val Peyson?I
 ain't goin' to call you by his name no more, the dirty cur!?I've
 been packin' that money in my stockin' for six months, jest so'st to have
 it handy when you wanted it. Divorces cost more'n marriage licenses, as
 you'll find out when you git started. And?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You?why, the idea!" Val pursed her lips with something like her old
 spirit. "How could <i>you</i> know I'd need to borrow money? I didn't know
 it myself, even. I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I c'n see through a wall when there's a knothole in it,"
 paraphrased Arline calmly. "You may not know it, but you've been gittin'
 your back-East notions knocked outa you pretty fast the last year or so.
 It was all a question of what kinda stuff you was made of underneath. You
 c'n put a polish on most anything, so I couldn't tell, right at first,
 what there was to you. But you're all right?I've seen that a long
 time back; and so I knowed durn well you'd be wantin' money to pull loose
 with. It takes money, though I know it ain't polite to say much about real
 dollars 'n' cents. You'll likely use every cent of that before you're
 through with the deal?and remember, there's a lot more growin' on
 the same bush, if you need it. It's only waitin' to be picked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val stared, found her eyes blurring so that she could not see, and with a
 sudden, impulsive movement leaned over and put her arms around Arline,
 unkempt, scrawny, and wholly unlovely though she was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Arline, you're an angel of goodness!" she cried brokenly. "You're the
 best friend I ever had in my life?I've had many who petted me and
 flattered me?but you?you <i>do</i> things! I'm ashamed?because
 I haven't loved you every minute since I first saw you. I judged you?I
 mean?oh, you're pure, shining gold inside, instead of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, git out!" Arline was compelled to gulp twice before she could say
 even that much. "I don't shine nowhere?inside er out. I know that
 well enough. I never had no chancet to shine. It's always been wore off
 with hard knocks. But I like shiny folks all right?when they're fine
 clear through, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Arline?dear, I do love you. I always shall. I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline loosened her clasp and jumped up precipitately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Git out!" she repeated bashfully. "If you git me to cryin', Val Peyson,
 I'll wish you was in Halifax. You go to bed, 'n' go to sleep, er I'll?"
 She almost ran from the room. Outside, she stopped in a darkened corner of
 the hallway and stood for some minutes with her checked gingham apron
 pressed tightly over her face, and several times she sniffed audibly. When
 she finally returned to the kitchen her nose was pink, her eyelids were
 pink, and she was extremely petulant when she caught Minnie eying her
 curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val had refused to eat any supper, and, beyond telling Arline that she had
 decided to leave Manley and return to her mother in Fern Hill, she had not
 explained anything very clearly?her colorless face, for instance,
 nor her tightly swathed throat, nor the very noticeable bruise upon her
 temple.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline had not asked a single question. Now, however, she spent some time
 fixing a tray with the daintiest food she knew and could procure, and took
 it upstairs with a certain diffidence in her manner and a rare tenderness
 in her faded, worldly-wise eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You got to eat, you know," she reminded Val gently. "You're bucking up
 ag'inst the hardest part of the trail, and grub's a necessity. Take it
 like you would medicine?unless your throat's too sore. I see you got
 it all tied up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val raised her hands in a swift alarm and clasped her throat as if she
 feared Arline would remove the bandages.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's not sore?that is, it is sore?I mean not very much,"
 she stammered betrayingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline set down the tray upon the dresser and faced Val grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never asked you any questions, did I?" she demanded. "But you act for
 all the world as if?do you want me to give a guess about that
 tied-up neck, and that black'n'blue lump on your forehead? I never asked
 any questions?I didn't need to. Man Fleetwood's been maulin' you
 abound. I was kinda afraid he'd git to that point some day when he got mad
 enough; he's just the brand to beat up a woman. But if it took a beatin'
 to bring you to the quitting point, I'm glad he done it. <i>Only</i>," she
 added darkly, "he better keep outa my reach; I'm jest in the humor to claw
 him up some if I should git close enough. And if I happened to forget I'm
 a lady, I'd sure bawl him out, and the bigger crowd heard me the better.
 Now, you eat this?and don't get the idee you can cover up any
 meanness of Man Fleetwood's; not from me, anyhow. I know men better'n you
 do; you couldn't tell me nothing about 'em that would su'prise me the
 least bit. I'm only thankful he didn't murder you in cold blood. Are you
 going to eat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not if you keep on reminding me of such h-horrid things," wailed Val, and
 sobbed into her pillow. "It's bad enough to?to have him ch-choke me
 without having you t-talk about it all the time!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, honey, don't you waste no tears on a brute like him?he ain't
 w-worth it!" Arline was on her bony knees beside the bed, crying with
 sympathy and self-reproach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, in truly feminine fashion, the two wept their way back to the solid
 ground of everyday living. Before they reached that desirable state of
 composure, however, Val told her everything?within certain limits
 set not by caution, but rather by her woman's instinct. She did not, for
 instance, say much about Kent, though she regretted openly that Polycarp
 knew so much about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hope never needed no newspaper so long as Polycarp lives here," Arline
 grumbled when Val was sitting up again and trying to eat Arline's toast,
 and jelly made of buffalo berries, and sipping the tea which had gone
 cold. "But if I can round him up in time, I'll try and git him to keep his
 mouth shet. I'll scare the liver outa him some way. But if he caught onto
 that calf deal?" She shook her head doubtfully. "The worst of it is,
 Fred's in town, and he's always pumpin' Polycarp dry, jest to find out all
 that's goin' on. You go to bed, and I'll see if I can find out whether
 they're together. If they are?but you needn't to worry none. I
 reckon I'm a match for the both of 'em. Why, I'd dope their coffee and
 send 'em both to sleep till Man got outa the country, if I had to!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood with her hands upon her angular hips and glared at Val.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I sure would do that, very thing?for <i>you</i>," she reiterated
 solemnly, "I don't purtend I'd do it for Man?but I would for you.
 But it's likely Kent has fixed things up so they can't git nothing on Man
 if they try. He would if he said he would; that there's <i>one</i> feller
 that's on the square. You go to bed now, whilst I go on a still hunt of my
 own. I'll come and tell you if there's anything to tell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was easy enough to make the promise, but keeping it was so difficult
 that she yielded to the temptation of going to bed and letting Val sleep
 in peace; which she could not have done if she had known that Polycarp
 Jenks and Fred De Garmo left town on horseback within an hour after
 Polycarp had entered it, and that they told no man their errand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Over behind Brinberg's store, Polycarp had told Fred all he knew, all he
 suspected, and all he believed would come to pass. "Strictly on the
 quiet," of course?he reminded Fred of that, over and over, because
 he had promised Mrs. Fleetwood that he would not mention it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, by granny," he apologized, "I didn't like the idee of keepin' <i>a</i>
 thing like that from <i>you</i>; it would kinda look as if I was standin'
 in on the deal, which I ain't. Nobody can't accuse me of rustlin', no
 matter what else I might do; you know that, Fred."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure, I know you're honest, anyway," Fred responded quite sincerely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I considered it my duty to tell you. I've kinda had my suspicions
 all fall, that there was somethin' scaly goin' on at Cold Spring. Looked
 to me like Man had too blamed many calves missed by spring round-up?for
 the size of his herd. I dunno, of course, jest where he gits 'em?you'll
 have to find that out. But he's brung twelve er fourteen to the ranch, two
 er three at a time. And what she said when she first come to?told me
 right out, by granny, 'at Man choked her because she called 'im a thief,
 and somethin' about a cow comin' an' claimin' her calf, and her turnin' it
 out. That oughta be might' nigh all the evidence you need, Fred, if you
 find it. She don't know she said it, but she wouldn't of told it, by
 granny, if it wasn't so?now would she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you say all this happened to-day?" Fred pondered for a minute.
 "That's queer, because I almost caught a fellow last night doing some
 funny work on a calf. A Wishbone cow it was, and her calf fresh burned?a
 barred-out brand, by thunder! If it was to-day, I'd, say Man found it and
 blotched the brand. I wish now I'd hazed them over to the Double Diamond
 and corralled 'em, like I had a mind to. But we can find them, easy
 enough. But that was last night, and you say this big setting came off
 to-day; you <i>sure</i>, Polly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Course I'm sure." Polycarp waggled his head solemnly. He was enjoying
 himself to the limit. He was the man on the inside, giving out information
 of the greatest importance, and an officer of the law was hanging
 anxiously upon his words. He spoke slowly, giving weight to every word. "I
 rode up to the house?Man's house?somewhere close to noon, an'
 there she was, layin' on the kitchen floor. Didn't know nothin', an' had
 the marks of somebody's fingers on 'er throat; the rest of her neck's so
 white they showed up, by granny, like?like?" Polycarp never
 could think of a simile. He always expectorated in such an emergency, and
 left his sentence unfinished. He did so now, and Fred cut in unfeelingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind that?you've gone over it half a dozen times. You say it
 was to-day, at noon, or thereabouts. Man must have done it when he found
 out she'd turned the calf loose?he wouldn't unless he was pretty
 mad, and scared. He isn't cold-blooded enough to wait till he'd barred out
 the brand, and then go home and choke his wife. He didn't know about the
 calf till to-day, that's a cinch." He studied the matter with an air of
 grave importance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Polycarp," he said abruptly, "I'm going to need you. We've got to find
 that bunch of cattle?it ought to be easy enough, and haze 'em down
 into Man's field where his bunch of calves are?see? Any calf that's
 been weaned in the last three weeks will be pretty likely to claim its
 mother; and if he's got any calves branded that claim cows with some other
 brand?well?" He threw out his hands in a comprehensive
 gesture. "That's the quickest way I know to get him," he said. "I want a
 witness along, and some help. And you," he eyed Polycarp keenly, "ain't
 safe running around town loose. All your brains seem to leak out your
 mouth. So you come along with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?any time after to-morrer," hedged Polycarp, offended by the
 implication that he talked too much. "I've got to drive the team home for
 Mis' Fleetwood to-morrer, I tol' her I would?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you won't. You're going to hit the trail with me just as soon as I
 can find a horse for you to ride. We'll sleep at the Double Diamond, and
 start from there in the morning. And if I catch you letting a word outa
 you about this deal, I'll just about have to arrest you for?" He did
 not quite know what, but the very vagueness of the threat had its effect
 upon Polycarp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went without further argument, though first he went to the Hawley Hotel?with
 Fred close beside him as a precaution against imprudent gossip?and
 left word in the office that he would not be able to drive Mrs. Fleetwood
 home, the next morning, but would be back to take her out the day after
 that, if she did not mind staying in town. It was that message which
 Arline deliberately held back from Val until morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You better stay here," she advised then. "Polycarp an' Fred's up to some
 devilment, that's a cinch; but whatever it is, you're better off right
 here with me. S'posen you should drive out there and run into Man?what
 then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val shivered. "I?that's the only thing I can't bear," she admitted,
 as if the time for proud dignity and reserve had gone by. "If I could be
 sure I wouldn't need to meet him, I'd rather go alone; really and truly, I
 would. You know the horses are perfectly safe?I've driven them to
 town fifty times if I have once. I had to, out there alone so much of the
 time. I'd rather not have Polycarp spying around. I've got to pack up?there
 are so many things of no value to?to <i>him</i>, things I brought
 out here with me. And there are all my manuscripts; I can't leave them
 lying around, even if they aren't worth anything; especially since they
 aren't worth anything." She pushed back her hair with a weary movement.
 "If I could only be sure?if I knew where <i>he</i> is," she sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll lend you my gun," Arline offered in good faith. "If he comes around
 you and starts any funny business again, you can stand him off, even if
 you got some delicate feelin's about blowin' his brains out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I couldn't. I'm deadly afraid of guns." Val shuddered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then you can't go atone. I'd go with you, if you could git packed
 up so as to come back to-day. I guess Min could make out to git two meals
 alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no. Really and truly, Arline, I'd just as soon go alone. I would
 rather, dear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arline was not accustomed to being called "dear." She surrendered with
 some confusion and a blush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you better wait," she admonished temporizingly. "Something may turn
 up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently something did turn up. She rushed breathlessly into Val's room
 and caught her by the arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now's your chancet, Val," she hissed in a loud whisper. "Man jest now
 rode into town; he's over in Pop's place?I seen him go in. He's good
 for the day, sure. I'll have Hank hitch right up, an' you can go down to
 the stable and start from there, so'st he won't see you. An' I'll keep an
 eye out, 'n' if he leaves town I won't be fur behind, lemme tell you. He
 won't, though; there ain't one chancet in a hundred he'll leave that
 saloon till he's full?an' if he tries t' go then, I'll have somebody
 lock 'im up in the ice house till you git back. You want to hurry up that
 packin', an' git in here quick's you can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went to the stable with Val, her apron thrown over her head for want
 of a hat. "When Val was settling herself in the seat, Arline caught at the
 wheel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say! How'n time you goin' to git your trunks loaded into the wagon?" she
 cried. "You can't do it alone." Val parsed her lips; she had not thought
 of that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Polycarp will come, by the time I am ready," she decided. "You
 couldn't keep him away, Arline; he would be afraid he might miss
 something, because I suppose ours is the only ranch in the country where
 the wheels aren't turning smoothly. Polycarp and I can manage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hank, grinning under his ragged, brown mustache, handed her the lines.
 "I've got my orders," he told her briefly. "I'll watch out the trail's
 kept clear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thank you. I've so many good friends," Val answered, giving him a
 smile to stir his sluggish blood. "Good-bye, Arline. Don't worry about me,
 there's a dear. I shall not be back before to-morrow night, probably."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both Arline and Hank stood where they were and watched her out of sight
 before they turned back to the sordid tasks which made up their lives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She'll make it?she's the proper stuff," Hank remarked, and lighted
 his pipe. Arline, for a wonder, sighed and said nothing.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIII. CAUGHT!
 </h2>
 <p>
 After two nights and a day of torment unbearable, Kent bolted from his
 work, which would have taken him that day, as it had done the day before,
 in a direction opposite to that which his mind and his heart followed, and
 without apology or explanation to his foreman rode straight to Cold Spring
 Coulee. He had no very definite plan, except to see Val. He did not even
 know what he would say when he faced her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Michael was steaming from nose to tail when he stopped at the yard gate,
 which shows how impatience had driven his master. Kent glanced quickly
 around the place as he walked up the narrow path to the house. Nothing was
 changed in the slightest particular, as far as he could see, and he
 realized then that he had been uneasy as well as anxious. Both doors were
 closed, so that he was obliged to knock before Val became visible. He had
 a fleeting impression of extreme caution in the way she opened the door
 and looked out, but he forgot it immediately in his joy at seeing her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's you. Come in, and?you won't mind if I close the door? I'm
 afraid I'm the victim of nerves, to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" Kent was instantly solicitous. "Has anything happened since I was
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val shook her head, smiling faintly. "Nothing that need to worry <i>you</i>,
 pal. I don't want to talk about worries. I want to be cheered up; I
 haven't laughed, Kent, for so long I'm afraid my facial muscles are
 getting stiff. Say something funny, can't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent pushed his hat far back on his head and sat down upon a corner of the
 table. "Such is life in the far West?and the farther West you go,
 the livelier?" he began to declaim dutifully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The livelier it gets. Yes, I've heard that a million tunes, I believe. I
 can't laugh at that; I never did think it funny." She sighed, and twitched
 her shoulders impatiently because of it. "I see you brought back the
 glasses," she remarked inanely. "You certainly weren't in any great hurry,
 were you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, they had us riding over east of the home ranch, hazing in some outa
 the hills. I'm supposed to be over there right now?but I ain't. I
 expect I'll get the can, all right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you're going away, what do you care?" she taunted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm?sure, what do I care?" He eyed her from under his brows while
 he bent to light a match upon the sole of his boot. Val had long ago
 settled his compunctions about smoking in her presence. "You seem to be
 all tore up, here," he observed irrelevantly. "Cleaning house?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?cleaning house." Val smiled ambiguously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hubby in town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?he went in yesterday, and hasn't come back yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent smoked for a moment meditatively. "I found that calf, all right," he
 informed her at last. "It was too late to ride around this way and tell
 you that night. So you needn't worry any more about that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not worrying about that." Val stooped and picked up a hairpin from
 the floor, and twirled it absently in her fingers. "I don't think it
 matters, any more. Yesterday afternoon Fred De Garmo and Polycarp Jenks
 came into the coulee with a bunch of cattle, and turned all the calves out
 of the river field with them; and, after a little, they drove the whole
 lot of them away somewhere?over that way." She waved a slim hand to
 the west. "They let out the calves in the corral, too. I saw them from the
 window, but I didn't ask them any questions. I really didn't need to, did
 I?" She grazed him with a glance. "I thought perhaps you had failed to
 find that calf; I'm glad you did, though?so it wasn't that started
 them hunting around here?Polycarp and Fred I mean."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent looked at her queerly. Her voice was without any emotion whatever, as
 if the subject held no personal interest for her. He finished his
 cigarette and threw the stub out into the yard before either of them spoke
 another word. He closed the door again, stood there for a minute making up
 his mind, and went slowly over to where she was sitting listlessly in a
 chair, her hands folded loosely in her lap. He gripped with one hand the
 chairback and stared down at her high-piled, yellow hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long do you think I'm going to stand around and let you be dragged
 into trouble like this?" he began abruptly. "You know what I told you the
 other day?I could say the same thing over again, and a lot more; and
 I'd mean more than I could find words for. Maybe you can stand this sort
 of thing?I can't. I'm not going to try. If you're bound to stick to
 that?that gentleman, I'm going to get outa the country where I can't
 see you killed by inches. Every time I come, you're a little bit whiter,
 and a little bigger-eyed?I can't stand it, I tell you!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You weren't made for a hell like you're living. You were meant to be
 happy?and I was meant to make you happy. Every morning when I open
 my eyes?do you know what I think? I think it's another day we oughta
 be happy in, you and me." He took her suddenly by the shoulder and brought
 her up, facing him, where he could look into her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We've only got just one life to live, Val!" he pleaded. "And we could be
 happy together?I'd stake my life on that. I can't go on forever just
 being friends, and eating my heart out for you, and seeing you abused?and
 what for? Just because a preacher mumbled some words over you two! Only
 for that, you wouldn't stay with him over-night, and you know it! Is <i>that</i>
 what ought to tie two human beings together?without love, or even
 friendship? You hate him; you can't look me in the eyes and say you don't.
 And he's tired of you. Some other woman would please him better. And I
 could make you happy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val broke away from his grasp, and retreated until the table was between
 them. Her listlessness was a thing forgotten. She was panting with the
 quick beating of her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kent?don't, pal! You mustn't say those things?it's wicked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's true," he cried hotly. "Can you look at me and say it ain't the
 truth?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've spoiled our friendship, Kent!" she accused, while she evaded his
 question. "It meant so much to me?just your dear, good friendship."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My love could mean a whole lot more," he declared sturdily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you mustn't say those things?you mustn't feel that way, Kent!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" He laughed grimly. "Mustn't I? How are you going to stop me?" He
 stared hard at her, his face growing slowly rigid. "There's just one way
 to stop me from saying such wicked things," he told her. "You can tell me
 you don't care anything about me, and never could, not even if that
 down-east conscience of yours didn't butt into the game. You can tell me
 that, and swear it's the truth, and I'll leave the country. I'll go so far
 you'll newer see me again, so I'll never bother you any more. I can't
 promise I'll stop loving you?but for my own sake I'll sure try hard
 enough." He set his teeth hard together and stood quiet, watching her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val tied to answer him. Evidently she could not manage her voice, for he
 saw her begin softly beating her lips with her fist, fighting to get back
 her self-control. Once or twice he had seen her do that, when, womanlike,
 the tears would come in spite of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want you to go a-away," she articulated at last, with a hint of
 stubbornness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what <i>do</i> you want? I can't stay, unless?" He did not
 attempt to finish the sentence. He knew there was no need; she understood
 well enough the alternative.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For long minutes she did not speak, because she could not. Like many
 women, she fought desperately against the tears which seemed a badge of
 her femininity. She sat down in a chair, dropped her face upon her folded
 arms, and bit her lips until they were sore. Kent took a step toward her,
 reconsidered, and went over to the window, where he stood staring moodily
 out until she began speaking. Even then, he did not turn immediately
 toward her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You needn't go, Kent," she said with some semblance of calm. "Because I'm
 going. I didn't tell you?but I'm going home. I'm going to get free,
 by the same law that tied me to him. You are right?I have a
 'down-east' conscience. I think I was born with it. It demands that I get
 my freedom honestly; I can't steal it?pal. I couldn't be happy if I
 did that, no matter how hard I might try?or you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned eagerly toward her then, but she stopped him with a gesture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?stay where you are. I want to solve my problem and?and
 leave you out of it; you're a complication, pal?when you talk like?like
 you've just been talking. It makes my conscience wonder whether I'm honest
 with myself. I've got to leave you out, don't you see? And so, leaving you
 out, I don't feel that any woman should be expected to go on like I'm
 doing. You don't know?I couldn't tell you just how?impossible?this
 marriage of mine has become. The day after?well, yesterday?no,
 the day before yesterday?he came home and found out?what I'd
 done. He?I couldn't stay here, after that, so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did he do?" Kent demanded sharply. "He didn't dare to lay his hands
 on you?did he? By?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't swear, Kent?I hear so much of that from him!" Val smiled
 curiously. "He?he swore at me. I couldn't stay with him, after that?could
 I, dear?" Whether she really meant to speak that last word or not, it set
 Kent's blood dancing so that he forgot to urge his question farther. He
 took two eager steps toward her, and she retreated again behind the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kent, don't! How can I tell you anything, if you won't be good?" She
 waited until he was standing rather sulkily by the window again. "Anyway,
 it doesn't matter now what he has done. I am going to leave him. I'm going
 to get a divorce. Not even the strictest 'down-east' conscience could
 demand that I stay. I'm perfectly at ease upon that point. About this last
 trouble?with the calves?if I could help him, I would, of
 course. But all I could say would only make matters worse?and I'm a
 wretched failure at lying. I can help him more, I think, by going away. I
 feel certain there's going to be trouble over those calves. Fred De Garmo
 never would have come down here and driven them all away, would he, unless
 there was going to be trouble?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If he came in here and got the calves, it looks as if he meant business,
 all right." Kent frowned absently at the white window curtain. "I've seen
 the time," he added reflectively, "when I'd be all broke up to have Man
 get into trouble. We used to be pretty good friends!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A year ago it would have broken my heart," Val sighed. "We do change so!
 I can't quite understand Why I should feel so indifferent about it now;
 even the other day it was terrible. But when I felt his fingers?"
 she stopped guiltily. "He seems a stranger to me now. I don't even hate
 him so very much. I don't want to meet him, though."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Neither do I." But there was a different meaning in Kent's tone. "So
 you're going to quit?" He looked at her thoughtfully?"You'll leave
 your address, I hope!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes." Val's voice betrayed some inward trepidation. "I'm not running
 away; I'm just going."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see." He sighed, impatient at the restraint she had put upon him. "That
 don't mean you won't ever come back, does it? Or that the trains are going
 to quit carrying passengers to your town? Because you can't <i>always</i>
 keep me outa your 'problem,' let me tell you. Is it against the rules to
 ask when you're going?and how?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just as soon as I can get my trunks packed, and Polycarp?or
 somebody?comes to help me load them into the spring wagon. I
 promised Arline Hawley I would be in town to-night. I don't know, though?I
 don't seem to be making much progress with my packing." She smiled at him
 more brightly. "Let's wade ashore, pal, and get to work instead of talking
 about things better left alone. I know just exactly what you're thinking?and
 I'm going to let you help me instead of Polycarp. I'm frightfully angry
 with him, anyway. He promised me, on his word of honor, that he wouldn't
 mention a thing?and he must have actually hunted for a chance to
 tell! He didn't have the nerve to come to the house yesterday, when he was
 here with Fred?perhaps he won't come to-day, after all. So you'll
 have to help me make my getaway, pal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent wavered. "You're the limit, all right," he told her after a period of
 hesitation. "You just wait, old girl, till you get that conscience of
 yours squared! What shall I do? I can pack a war-bag in one minute and
 three-quarters, and a horse in five minutes?provided he don't get
 gay and pitch the pack off a time or two, and somebody's around to help
 throw the hitch. Just tell me where to start in, and you won't be able to
 see me for dust!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem in a frightful hurry to have me go," Val complained, laughing
 nevertheless with the nervous reaction. "Packing a trunk takes time, and
 care, and intelligence."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now isn't that awful?" Kent's eyes flared with mirth, all the more
 pronounced because it was entirely superficial. "Well, you take the time
 and care, Mrs. Goodpacker, and I'll cheerfully furnish the intelligence,
 This goes, I reckon?" He squeezed a pink cushion into as small a space as
 possible, and held it out at arm's length.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That goes?to Arline. <i>Don't</i> put it in there!" Val's laughter
 was not far from hysteria. Kent was pretending to stuff the pink cushion
 into her hand bag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Better take it; you'll?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The front door was pushed violently open and Manley almost fell into the
 room. Val gave a little, inarticulate cry and shrank back against the wall
 before she could recover herself. They had for the moment forgotten
 Manley, and all he stood for in the way of heartbreak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A strange-looking Manley he was, with his white face and staring,
 bloodshot eyes, and the cruel, animal lines around his mouth. Hardly
 recognizable to one who had not seen him since three or four years before,
 he would have been. He stopped short just over the threshold, and glanced
 suspiciously from one to the other before he came farther into the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dig up some grub, Val?in a bag, so I can carry it on horseback," he
 commanded. "And a blanket?where did you put those rifle cartridges?"
 He hurried across the room to where his rifle and belt hung upon the wall,
 just over the little, homemade bookcase. "I had a couple of boxes?where
 are they?" He snatched down the rifle, took the belt, and began buckling
 it around him with fumbling fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mechanically Val reached upon a higher shelf and got him the two boxes of
 shells. Her eyes were fixed curiously upon his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What has happened?" she asked him as he tore open a box and began pushing
 the shells, one by one, into his belt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fred De Garmo?he tried to arrest me?in town?I shot him
 dead," He glanced furtively at Kent. "Can I take your horse, Kent? I want
 to get across the river before?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shot?Fred?" Val was staring at him stupidly. He whirled
 savagely toward her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and I'd shoot any man that walked up and tried to take me. He was a
 fool if he thought all he had to do was crook his finger and say 'Come
 along.' It was over those calves?and I'd say you had a hand in it,
 if I hadn't found that calf, and saw how you burned out the brand before
 you turned it loose. You might have told me?I wouldn't have?"
 He shifted his gaze toward Kent. "The hell of it is, the sheriff happened
 to be in town for something; he's back a couple of miles?for God's
 sake, move! And get that flour and bacon, and some matches. I've got to
 get across the river. I can shake 'em off, on the other side. Hurry, Val!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went out into the kitchen, and they heard her moving about, collecting
 the things he needed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll have to take your horse, Kent." Manley turned to him with a certain
 wheedling tone, infinitely disgusting to the other. "Mine's all in?I
 rode him down, getting this far. I've got to get across the river, and
 into the hills the other side?I can dodge 'em over there. You can
 have my horse?he's good as yours, anyway." He seemed to fed a slight
 discomfort at Kent's silence. "You've always stood by me?anyway, it
 wasn't so much my fault?he came at me unawares, and says 'Man
 Fleetwood, you're my prisoner!' Why, the very tone of him was an insult?and
 I won't stand for being arrested?I pulled my gun and got him through
 the lungs?heard 'em yelling he was dead?Hurry up with that
 grub! I can't wait here till?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ought to tell you Michael's no good for water," Kent forced himself to
 say. "He's liable to turn back on you; he's scared of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He won't turn back with <i>me</i>?not with old Jake Bondy at my
 heels!" Manley snatched the bag of provisions from Val when she appeared,
 and started for the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You better leave off some of that hardware, then," Kent advised
 perfunctorily. "You're liable to have to swim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't care how I get across, just so?" A panic seemed to seize
 him then. Without a word of thanks or farewell he rushed out, threw
 himself into Kent's saddle without taking time to tie on his bundle of
 bacon and flour, or remembering the blanket he had asked for. Holding his
 provisions under his arm, his rifle in one hand, and his reins clutched in
 the other, he struck the spurs home and raced down the coulee toward the
 river. Fred and Polycarp had not troubled to put up the wire gate after
 emptying the river field, so he had a straight run of it to the very river
 bank. The two stood together at the window and watched him go.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIV. RETRIBUTION
 </h2>
 <p>
 "He thought it was I burned out that, brand; did you notice what he said?"
 Val, as frequently happens in times of stress, spoke first of a trivial
 matter, before her mind would grasp the greater issues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'll never make it," said Kent, speaking involuntarily his thought.
 "There comes old Jake Bondy, now, down the hill. Still, I dunno?if
 Michael takes to the water all right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If the sheriff comes here, what shall we tell him? Shall we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He won't. He's turning off, don't you see? He must have got a sight of
 Man from the top of the hill. Michael's tolerably fresh, and Jake's horse
 isn't; that makes a big difference."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val weakened unexpectedly, as the full meaning of it all swept through her
 mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's horrible!" she whispered. "Kent, what can we do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not a thing, only keep our heads, and don't give way to nerves," he
 hinted. "It's something out of our reach; let's not go all to pieces over
 it, pal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She steadied under his calm voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm always acting foolish just at the wrong time?but to think he
 could?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't think! You'll have enough of that to do, managing your own affairs.
 All this doesn't change a thing for you. It makes you feel bad?and
 for that I could kill him, almost!" So much flashed out, and then he
 brought himself in hand again. "You've still got to pack your trunks, and
 take the train home, just the same as if this hadn't happened. I didn't
 like the idea at first, but now I see it's the best thing you can do, for
 the present. After awhile?we'll see about it. Don't look out, if it
 upsets you, Val. You can't do any good, and you've got to save your
 nerves. Let pull down the shade?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I've got to see!" Perversely, she caught up the field glasses from
 the table, drew them from their case, and, letting down the upper window
 sash with a slam, focused the glasses upon the river. "He usually crosses
 right at the mouth of the coulee?" She swung the glasses slowly
 about. "Oh, there he is?just on the bank. The river looks rather
 high?oh, your horse doesn't want to go in, Kent. He whirls on his
 hind feet, and tried to bolt when Manley started in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent had been watching her face jealously. "Here, let me take a look, will
 you? I can tell?" She yielded reluctantly, and in a moment he had
 caught the focus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me what you see, Kent?everything," she begged, looking
 anxiously from his face to the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, old Jake is fogging along down the coulee?but he ain't to the
 river yet, not by a long shot! Ah-h! Man's riding back to take a run in.
 That's the stuff?got Michael's feet wet that time, the old freak!
 They came near going clean outa sight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The sheriff?is he close enough?" Val began fearfully. "Oh,
 we're too far away to do a thing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent kept his eyes to the glasses. "We couldn't do a thing if we were
 right there. Man's in swimming water already. Jake ain't riding in?from
 the motions he's ordering Man back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, please let me look a minute! I won't get excited, Kent, and I'll tell
 you everything I see?<i>please!</i>" Val's teeth were fairly
 chattering with excitement, so that Kent hesitated before he gave up the
 glasses. But it seemed boorish to refuse. She snatched at them as he took
 them from his eyes, and placed them nervously to her own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I see them both!" she cried, after a second or two. "The sheriff's
 got his rifle in his hands?Kent, do you suppose he'd?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just a bluff, pal. They all do it. What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val gave a start. "Oh, he shot, Kent! I saw him take aim?it looked
 as if he pointed it straight at Manley, and the smoke?" She moved
 the glasses slowly, searching the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he'd have to be a dandy, to hit anything on the water, and with the
 sun in his eyes, too," Kent assured her, hardly taking his eyes from her
 face with its varying expression. Almost he could see what was taking
 place at the river, just by watching her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, there's Manley, away out! Why, your Michael is swimming beautifully,
 Kent! His head is high out of the water, and the water is churning like?Oh,
 Manley's holding his rifle up over his head?he's looking back toward
 shore. I wonder," she added softly, "what he's thinking about! Manley!
 you're my husband?and once I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Draw a bead on that gazabo on shore," Kent interrupted her faint faring
 up of sentiment toward the man she had once loved and loved no more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val drew a long breath and turned the glasses reluctantly from the
 fugitive. "I don't see him?oh, yes! He's down beside a rock, on one
 knee, and he's taking a rest across the rock, and is squinting along?oh,
 he can't hit him at that distance, can he, Kent? Would he dare?why,
 it would be murder, wouldn't it? Oh-h?<i>he shot again</i>!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent reached up a hand and took the glasses from her eyes with a masterful
 gesture. "You let me look," he said laconically. "I'm steadier than you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Val crept closer to him, and looked up into his face. She could read
 nothing there; his mouth was shut tight so that it was a stern, straight
 line, but that told her nothing. He always looked so when he was intent
 upon something, or thinking deeply. She turned her eyes toward the river,
 flowing smoothly across the mouth of the coulee. Between, the land lay
 sleeping lazily in the hazy sunlight of mid-autumn. The grass was brown,
 the rocky outcroppings of the coulee wall yellow and gray and red?and
 the river was so blue, and so quiet! Surely that sleepy coulee and that
 placid river could not be witnessing a tragedy. She turned her head,
 irritated by its very calmness. Her eyes dwelt wistfully upon Kent's
 half-concealed face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are they doing now, Kent?" Her tone was hushed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't?exactly?" He mumbled absently, his mind a mile away.
 She waited a moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you see?Manley?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This time he did not answer at all; he seemed terribly far off, as if only
 his shell of a body remained with her in the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you talk?" she wailed. She waited until she could endure no
 more, then reached up and snatched the glasses from his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't help it?I shall go crazy standing here. I've just got to
 see!" she panted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a moment he clung to the glasses and stared down at her. "You better
 not, sweetheart," he urged gently, but when she still held fast he let
 them go. She raised them hurriedly to her eyes, and turned to the river
 with a shrinking impatience to know the worst and have it over with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "E-everything j-joggles so," she whimpered complainingly, trying vainly to
 steady the glasses. He slipped his arms around her, and let her lean
 against him; she did not even seem to realize it. Just then she had caught
 sight of something, and her intense interest steadied her so that she
 stood perfectly still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, your horse?" she gasped. "Michael?he's got his feet
 straight up in the air?oh, Kent, he's rolling over sad over! I can't
 see?" She held her breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The glasses sagged as if they had grown all at once too heavy to hold. "I?I
 thought I saw?" She shivered and hid her face upon one upflung arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kent caught up the glasses and looked long at the river, unmindful of the
 girl sobbing wildly beside him. Finally he turned to her, hesitated, and
 then gathered her close in his arms. The glasses slid unheeded to the
 floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't cry?it's better this way, though it's hard enough, God
 knows." His voice was very gentle. "Think how awful it would have been,
 Val, if the law had got him. Don't cry like that! Such things are
 happening every day, somewhere?" He realized suddenly that this was
 no way to comfort her, and stopped. He patted her shoulder with a sense of
 blank helplessness. He could make love?but this was not the time for
 love-making; and since he was denied that outlet for his feelings, he did
 not know what to do, except that he led her to the couch, and settled her
 among the cushions so that she would be physically comfortable, at least.
 He turned restlessly to the window, looked; out, and then went to the
 couch and bent over her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going out to the gate?I want to see Jake Bondy. He's coming up
 the coulee," he said. "I won't be far. Poor little girl?poor little
 pal, I wish I could help you." He touched his lips to her hair, so lightly
 she could not feel it, and left her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the gate he met, not the sheriff, who was riding slowly, and had just
 passed through the field gate, but Arline and Hank, rattling up in the
 Hawley buck-board.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank the good Lord!" he exclaimed when he helped her from the rig. "I
 never was so glad to see anybody in my life. Go on in?she's in there
 crying her heart out. Man's dead?the sheriff shot him in the river?oh,
 there's been hell to pay out here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My heavens above!" Arline stared up at him while she grasped the
 significance of his words. "I knowed he'd hit for here?I followed
 right out as quick as Hank could hitch up the team. Did you hear about
 Fred?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, yes, I know all about it!" Kent was guilty of pulling her
 through the gate, and then pushing her toward the house. "You go and do
 something for that poor girl. Pack her up and take her to town as quick as
 God'll let you. There's been misery enough for her out here to kill a
 dozen women."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched until she had reached the porch, and then swung back to Hank,
 sitting calmly in the buckboard, with the lines gripped between his knees
 while he filled his pipe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can take care of the man's side of this business, fast enough," Kent
 confessed whimsically, "but there's some things it takes a woman to
 handle." He glanced again over his shoulder, gave a huge sigh of relief
 when he glimpsed Arline's thin face as she passed the window and knelt
 beside the couch, and turned with a lighter heart to meet the sheriff.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
