 <h2>
 CHAPTER I. Buckskin
 </h2>
 <p>
 The town lay sprawled over half a square mile of alkali plain, its main
 Street depressing in its width, for those who were responsible for its
 inception had worked with a generosity born of the knowledge that they had
 at their immediate and unchallenged disposal the broad lands of Texas and
 New Mexico on which to assemble a grand total of twenty buildings, four of
 which were of wood. As this material was scarce, and had to be brought
 from where the waters of the Gulf lapped against the flat coast, the
 last-mentioned buildings were a matter of local pride, as indicating the
 progressiveness of their owners.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These creations of hammer and saw were of one story, crude and unpainted;
 their cheap weather sheathing, warped and shrunken by the pitiless sun,
 curled back on itself and allowed unrestricted entrance to alkali dust and
 air. The other shacks were of adobe, and reposed in that magnificent
 squalor dear to their owners, Indians and Mexicans.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was an incident of the Cattle Trail, that most unique and stupendous of
 all modern migrations, and its founders must have been inspired with a
 malicious desire to perpetrate a crime against geography, or else they
 reveled in a perverse cussedness, for within a mile on every side lay
 broad prairies, and two miles to the east flowed the indolent waters of
 the Rio Pecos itself. The distance separating the town from the river was
 excusable, for at certain seasons of the year the placid stream swelled
 mightily and swept down in a broad expanse of turbulent, yellow flood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buckskin was a town of one hundred inhabitants, located in the valley of
 the Rio Pecos fifty miles south of the Texas-New Mexico line. The census
 claimed two hundred, but it was a well-known fact that it was exaggerated.
 One instance of this is shown by the name of Tom Flynn. Those who once
 knew Tom Flynn, alias Johnny Redmond, alias Bill Sweeney, alias Chuck
 Mullen, by all four names, could find them in the census list.
 Furthermore, he had been shot and killed in the March of the year
 preceding the census, and now occupied a grave in the young but
 flourishing cemetery. Perry's Bend, twenty miles up the river, was
 cognizant of this and other facts, and, laughing in open derision at the
 padded list, claimed to be the better town in all ways, including
 marksmanship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One year before this tale opens, Buck Peters, an example for the more
 recent Billy the Kid, had paid Perry's Bend a short but busy visit. He had
 ridden in at the north end of Main Street and out at the south. As he came
 in he was fired at by a group of ugly cowboys from a ranch known as the C
 80. He was hit twice, but he unlimbered his artillery, and before his
 horse had carried him, half dead, out on the prairie, he had killed one of
 the group. Several citizens had joined the cowboys and added their bullets
 against Buck. The deceased had been the best bartender in the country, and
 the rage of the suffering citizens can well be imagined. They swore
 vengeance on Buck, his ranch, and his stamping ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The difference between Buck and Billy the Kid is that the former never
 shot a man who was not trying to shoot him, or who had not been warned by
 some action against Buck that would call for it. He minded his own
 business, never picked a quarrel, and was quiet and pacific up to a
 certain point. After that had been passed he became like a raging cyclone
 in a tenement house, and storm-cellars were much in demand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fanning" is the name of a certain style of gun play not unknown among the
 bad men of the West. While Buck was not a bad man, he had to rub elbows
 with them frequently, and he believed that the sauce for the goose was the
 sauce for the gander. So be bad removed the trigger of his revolver and
 worked the hammer with the thumb of the "gun hand" or the heel of the
 unencumbered hand. The speed thus acquired was greater than that of the
 more modern double-action weapon. Six shots in a few seconds was his
 average speed when that number was required, and when it is thoroughly
 understood that at least some of them found their intended bullets it is
 not difficult to realize that fanning was an operation of danger when Buck
 was doing it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a good rider, as all cowboys are, and was not afraid of anything
 that lived. At one time he and his chums, Red Connors and Hopalong
 Cassidy, had successfully routed a band of fifteen Apaches who wanted
 their scalps. Of these, twelve never hunted scalps again, nor anything
 else on this earth, and the other three returned to their tribe with the
 report that three evil Spirits had chased them with "wheel guns"
 (cannons).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So now, since his visit to Perry's Bend, the rivalry of the two towns had
 turned to hatred and an alert and eager readiness to increase the
 inhabitants of each other's graveyard. A state of war existed, which for a
 time resulted in nothing worse than acrimonious suggestions. But the time
 came when the score was settled to the satisfaction of one side, at least.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Four ranches were also concerned in the trouble. Buckskin was surrounded
 by two, the Bar 20 and the Three Triangle. Perry's Bend was the common
 point for the C 80 and the Double Arrow. Each of the two ranch contingents
 accepted the feud as a matter of course, and as a matter of course took
 sides with their respective towns. As no better class of fighters ever
 lived, the trouble assumed Homeric proportions and insured a danger zone
 well worth watching.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bar-20's northern line was C 80's southern one, and Skinny Thompson took
 his turn at outriding one morning after the season's round-up. He was to
 follow the boundary and turn back stray cattle. When he had covered the
 greater part of his journey he saw Shorty Jones riding toward him on a
 course parallel to his own and about long revolver range away. Shorty and
 he had "crossed trails" the year before and the best of feelings did not
 exist between them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shorty stopped and stared at Skinny, who did likewise at Shorty. Shorty
 turned his mount around and applied the spurs, thereby causing his
 indignant horse to raise both heels at Skinny. The latter took it all in
 gravely and, as Shorty faced him again, placed his left thumb to his nose,
 wiggling his fingers suggestively. Shorty took no apparent notice of this
 but began to shout:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu wants to keep yore busted-down cows on yore own side. They was all
 over us day afore yisterday. I'm goin' to salt any more what comes over,
 and don't yu fergit it, neither."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thompson wigwagged with his fingers again and shouted in reply: "Yu c'n
 salt all yu wants to, but if I ketch yu adoin' it yu won't have to work no
 more. An' I kin say right here thet they's more C 80 cows over here than
 they's Bar-20's over there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shorty reached for his revolver and yelled, "Yore a liar!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Among the cowboys in particular and the Westerners in general at that
 time, the three suicidal terms, unless one was an expert in drawing quick
 and shooting straight with one movement, were the words "liar," "coward,"
 and "thief." Any man who was called one of these in earnest, and he was
 the judge, was expected to shoot if he could and save his life, for the
 words were seldom used without a gun coming with them. The movement of
 Shorty's hand toward his belt before the appellation reached him was
 enough for Skinny, who let go at long range?and missed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two reports were as one. Both urged their horses nearer and fired
 again. This time Skinny's sombrero gave a sharp jerk and a hole appeared
 in the crown. The third shot of Skinny's sent the horse of the other to
 its knees and then over on its side. Shorty very promptly crawled behind
 it and, as he did so, Skinny began a wide circle, firing at intervals as
 Shorty's smoke cleared away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shorty had the best position for defense, as he was in a shallow coule,
 but he knew that he could not leave it until his opponent had either grown
 tired of the affair or had used up his ammunition. Skinny knew it, too.
 Skinny also knew that he could get back to the ranch house and lay in a
 supply of food and ammunition and return before Shorty could cover the
 twelve miles he had to go on foot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally Thompson began to head for home. He had carried the matter as far
 as he could without it being murder. Too much time had elapsed now, and,
 besides, it was before breakfast and he was hungry. He would go away and
 settle the score at some time when they would be on equal terms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rode along the line for a mile and chanced to look back. Two C 80
 punchers were riding after him, and as they saw him turn and discover them
 they fired at him and yelled. He rode on for some distance and cautiously
 drew his rifle out of its long holster at his right leg. Suddenly he
 turned around in the saddle and fired twice. One of his pursuers fell
 forward on the neck of his horse, and his comrade turned to help him.
 Thompson wig-wagged again and rode on, reaching the ranch as the others
 were finishing their breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the table Red Connors remarked that the tardy one had a hole in his
 sombrero, and asked its owner how and where he had received it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Had a argument with C 80 out'n th' line."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go 'way! Ventilate enny?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good boy, sonny! Hey, Hopalong, Skinny perforated C 80 this mawnin'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong Cassidy was struggling with a mouthful of beef. He turned his
 eyes toward Red without ceasing, and grinning as well as he could under
 the circumstances managed to grunt out "Gu?," which was as near to
 "Good" as the beef would allow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lanky Smith now chimed in as he repeatedly stuck his knife into a
 reluctant boiled potato, "How'd yu do it, Skinny?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bet he sneaked up on him," joshed Buck Peters; "did yu ask his pardin,
 Skinny?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ask nuthin'," remarked Red, "he jest nachurly walks up to C 80 an' sez,
 'Kin I have the pleasure of ventilatin' yu?' an' C So he sez, 'If yu do it
 easy like,' sez he. Didn't he, Thompson?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll be some ventilatin' under th' table if yu fellows don't lemme
 alone; I'm hungry," complained Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, Hopalong, I bets yu I kin clean up C 80 all by my lonesome,"
 announced Buck, winking at Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah! Yu onct tried to clean up the Bend, Buckie, an' if Pete an' Billy
 hadn't afound yu when they come by Eagle Pass that night yu wouldn't be
 here eatin' beef by th' pound," glancing at the hard-working Hopalong. "It
 was plum lucky fer yu that they was acourtin' that time, wasn't it,
 Hopalong?" suddenly asked Red. Hopalong nearly strangled in his efforts to
 speak. He gave it up and nodded his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why can't yu git it straight, Connors? I wasn't doin' no courtin', it was
 Pete. I runned into him on th' other side o' th' pass. I'd look fine
 acourtin', wouldn't I?" asked the downtrodden Williams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pete Wilson skillfully flipped a potato into that worthy's coffee,
 spilling the beverage of the questionable name over a large expanse of
 blue flannel shirt. "Yu's all right, yu are. Why, when I meets yu, yu was
 lost in th' arms of yore ladylove. All I could see was yore feet. Go an'
 git tangled up with a two hundred and forty pound half-breed squaw an'
 then try to lay it onter me! When I proposed drownin' yore troubles over
 at Cowan's, yu went an' got mad over what yu called th' insinooation. An'
 yu shore didn't look any too blamed fine, neither."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All th' same," volunteered Thompson, who had taken the edge from his
 appetite, "we better go over an' pay C 80 a call. I don't like what Shorty
 said about saltin' our cattle. He'll shore do it, unless I camps on th'
 line, which same I hain't hankerin' after."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he wouldn't stop th' cows that way, Skinny; he was only afoolin',"
 exclaimed Connors meekly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Foolin' yore gran'mother! That there bunch'll do anything if we wasn't
 lookin'," hotly replied Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's shore nuff gospel, Thomp. They's sore fer mor'n one thing. They
 got aplenty when Buck went on th' warpath, an they's hankerin' to git
 square," remarked Johnny Nelson, stealing the pie, a rare treat, of his
 neighbor when that unfortunate individual was not looking. He had it
 halfway to his mouth when its former owner, Jimmy Price, a boy of
 eighteen, turned his head and saw it going.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi-yi! Yu clay-bank coyote, drap thet pie! Did yu ever see such a
 son-of-a-gun fer pie?" he plaintively asked Red Connors, as he grabbed a
 mighty handful of apples and crust. "Pie'll kill yu some day, yu
 bob-tailed jack! I had an uncle that died onct. He et too much pie an' he
 went an' turned green, an so'll yu if yu don't let it alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu ought'r seed th' pie Johnny had down in Eagle Flat," murmured Lanky
 Smith reminiscently. "She had feet that'd stop a stampede. Johnny was
 shore loco about her. Swore she was the finest blossom that ever growed."
 Here he choked and tears of laughter coursed down his weather-beaten face
 as he pictured her. "She was a dainty Mexican, about fifteen han's high
 an' about sixteen han's around. Johnny used to chalk off when he hugged
 her, usen't yu, Johnny? One night when he had got purty well around on th'
 second lap he run inter a feller jest startin' out on his fust. They
 hain't caught that Mexican yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nelson was pelted with everything in sight. He slowly wiped off the pie
 crust and bread and potatoes. "Anybody'd think I was a busted grub wagon,"
 he grumbled. When he had fished the last piece of beef out of his ear he
 went out and offered to stand treat. As the round-up was over, they slid
 into their saddles and raced for Cowan's saloon at Buckskin.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER II. The Rashness of Shorty
 </h2>
 <p>
 Buckskin was very hot; in fact it was never anything else. Few people were
 on the streets and the town was quiet. Over in the Houston hotel a crowd
 of cowboys was lounging in the barroom. They were very quiet?a
 condition as rare as it was ominous. Their mounts, twelve in all, were
 switching flies from their quivering skins in the corral at the rear.
 Eight of these had a large C 80 branded on their flanks; the other four, a
 Double Arrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the barroom a slim, wiry man was looking out of the dirty window up the
 street at Cowan's saloon. Shorty was complaining, "They shore oughter be
 here now. They rounded up last week." The man nearest assured him that
 they would come. The man at the window turned and said, "They's yer now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In front of Cowan's a crowd of nine happy-go-lucky, daredevil riders were
 sliding from their saddles. They threw their reins over the heads of their
 mounts and filed in to the bar. Laughter issued from the open door and the
 clink of glasses could be heard. They stood in picturesque groups, strong,
 self-reliant, humorous, virile. Their expensive sombreros were pushed far
 back on their heads and their hairy chaps were covered with the alkali
 dust from their ride.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cowan, bottle in hand, pushed out several more glasses. He kicked a dog
 from under his feet and looked at Buck. "Rounded up yet?" he inquired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore, day afore yisterday," came the reply. The rest were busy removing
 the dust from their throats, and gradually drifted into groups of two or
 three. One of these groups strolled over to the solitary card table, and
 found Jimmy Price resting in a cheap chair, his legs on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wisht yu'd extricate yore delicate feet from off'n this hyar table,
 James," humbly requested Lanky Smith, morally backed up by those with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as, they shore is delicate, Mr. Smith," responded Jimmy without
 moving.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We wants to play draw, Jimmy," explained Pete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore welcome to play if yu wants to. Didn't I tell yu when yu
 growed that mustache that yu didn't have to ask me any more?" queried the
 placid James, paternally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Call 'em off, sonny. Pete sez he kin clean me out. Anyhow, yu kin have
 the fust deal," compromised Lanky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm shore sorry fer Pete if he cayn't. Yu don't reckon I has to have fust
 deal to beat yu fellers, do yu? Go way an' lemme alone; I never seed such
 a bunch fer buttin' in as yu fellers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy Williams returned to the bar. Then he walked along it until he was
 behind the recalcitrant possessor of the table. While his aggrieved
 friends shuffled their feet uneasily to cover his approach, he tiptoed up
 behind Jimmy and, with a nod, grasped that indignant individual firmly by
 the neck while the others grabbed his feet. They carried him, twisting and
 bucking, to the middle of the street and deposited him in the dust,
 returning to the now vacant table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jimmy rested quietly for a few seconds and then slowly arose, dusting the
 alkali from him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' wall-eyed piruts," he muttered, and then scratched his head for a way
 to "play hunk." As he gazed sorrowfully at the saloon he heard a snicker
 from behind him. He, thinking it was one of his late tormentors, paid no
 attention to it. Then a cynical, biting laugh stung him. He wheeled, to
 see Shorty leaning against a tree, a sneering leer on his flushed face.
 Shorty's right hand was suspended above his holster, hooked to his belt by
 the thumb?a favorite position of his when expecting trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One of yore reg'lar habits?" he drawled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jimmy began to dust himself in silence, but his lips were compressed to a
 thin white line.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does they hurt yu?" pursued the onlooker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jimmy looked up. "I heard tell that they make glue outen cayuses,
 sometimes," he remarked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shorty's eyes flashed. The loss of the horse had been rankling in his
 heart all day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does they git yu frequent?" he asked. His voice sounded hard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, 'bout as frequent as yu lose a cayuse, I reckon," replied Jimmy
 hotly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shorty's hand streaked to his holster and Jimmy followed his lead. Jimmy's
 Colt was caught. He had bucked too much. As he fell Shorty ran for the
 Houston House.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pistol shots were common, for they were the universal method of expressing
 emotions. The poker players grinned, thinking their victim was letting off
 his indignation. Lanky sized up his hand and remarked half audibly, "He's
 a shore good kid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bartender, fearing for his new beveled, gilt-framed mirror, gave a
 hasty glance out the window. He turned around, made change and remarked to
 Buck, "Yore kid, Jimmy, is plugged." Several of the more credulous craned
 their necks to see, Buck being the first. "Judas!" he shouted, and ran out
 to where Jimmy lay coughing, his toes twitching. The saloon was deserted
 and a crowd of angry cowboys surrounded their chum-aboy. Buck had seen
 Shorty enter the door of the Houston House and he swore. "Chase them C 80
 and Arrow cayuses behind the saloon, Pete, an' git under cover."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jimmy was choking and he coughed up blood. "He's shore?got me. My?gun
 stuck," he added apologetically. He tried to sit up, but was not able and
 he looked surprised. "It's purty-damn hot-out here," he suggested. Johnny
 and Billy carried him in the saloon and placed him by the table, in the
 chair he had previously vacated. As they stood up he fell across the table
 and died.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy placed the dead boy's sombrero on his head and laid the refractory
 six-shooter on the table. "I wonder who th' dirty killer was." He looked
 at the slim figure and started to go out, followed by Johnny. As he
 reached the threshold a bullet zipped past him and thudded into the frame
 of the door. He backed away and looked surprised. "That's Shorty's
 shootin'?he allus misses 'bout that much." He looked out and saw
 Buck standing behind the live oak that Shorty had leaned against, firing
 at the hotel. Turning around he made for the rear, remarking to Johnny
 that "they's in th' Houston." Johnny looked at the quiet figure in the
 chair and swore softly. He followed Billy. Cowan, closing the door and
 taking a buffalo gun from under the bar, went out also and slammed the
 rear door forcibly.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER III. The Argument
 </h2>
 <p>
 Up the street two hundred yards from the Houston House Skinny and Pete lay
 hidden behind a bowlder. Three hundred yards on the other side of the
 hotel Johnny and Billy were stretched out in an arroyo. Buck was lying
 down now, and Hopalong, from his position in the barn belonging to the
 hotel, was methodically dropping the horses of the besieged, a job he
 hated as much as he hated poison. The corral was their death trap. Red and
 Lanky were emitting clouds of smoke from behind the store, immediately
 across the street from the barroom. A buffalo gun roared down by the plaza
 and several Sharps cracked a protest from different points. The town had
 awakened and the shots were dropping steadily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Strange noises filled the air. They grew in tone and volume and then
 dwindled away to nothing. The hum of the buffalo gun and the sobbing
 pi-in-in-ing of the Winchesters were liberally mixed with the sharp whines
 of the revolvers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were no windows in the hotel now. Raw furrows in the bleached wood
 showed yellow, and splinters mysteriously sprang from the casings. The
 panels of the door were producing cracks and the cheap door handle flew
 many ways at once. An empty whisky keg on the stoop boomed out mournfully
 at intervals and finally rolled down the steps with a rumbling protest.
 Wisps of smoke slowly climbed up the walls and seemed to be waving
 defiance to the curling wisps in the open.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pete raised his shoulder to refill the magazine of his smoking rifle and
 dropped the cartridges all over his lap. He looked sheepishly at Skinny
 and began to load with his other hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore plum loco, yu are. Don't yu reckon they kin hit a blue shirt at two
 hundred?" Skinny cynically inquired. "Got one that time," he announced a
 second later.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder who's got th' buffalo," grunted Pete. "Mus' be Cowan," he
 replied to his own question and settled himself to use his left hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't yu git Shorty; he's my meat," suggested Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu better tell Buck?he ain't got no love fer Shorty," replied Pete,
 aiming carefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The panic in the corral ceased and Hopalong was now sending his regrets
 against the panels of the rear door. He had cut his last initial in the
 near panel and was starting a wobbly "H" in its neighbor. He was in a good
 position. There were no windows in the rear wall, and as the door was a
 very dangerous place he was not fired at.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He began to get tired of this one-sided business and crawled up on the
 window ledge, dangling his feet on the outside. He occasionally sent a
 bullet at a different part of the door, but amused himself by annoying
 Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Plenty hot down there?" he pleasantly inquired, and as he received no
 answer he tried again. "Better save some of them cartridges fer some other
 time, Buck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck was sending 45-70's into the shattered window with a precision that
 presaged evil to any of the defenders who were rash enough to try to gain
 the other end of the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong bit off a chew of tobacco and drowned a green fly that was
 crawling up the side of the barn. The yellow liquid streaked downward a
 short distance and was eagerly sucked up by the warped boards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A spurt of smoke leaped from the battered door and the bored Hopalong
 promptly tumbled back inside. He felt of his arm, and then, delighted at
 the notice taken of his artistic efforts, shot several times from a crack
 on his right. "This yer's shore gittin' like home," he gravely remarked to
 the splinter that whizzed past his head. He shot again at the door and it
 sagged outward, accompanied by the thud of a falling body. "Pies like
 mother used to make," he announced to the loft as he slipped the magazine
 full of .45-70'S. "An' pills like popper used to take," he continued when
 he had lowered the level of the water in his flask.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rolled a cigarette and tossed the match into the air, extinguishing it
 by a shot from his Colt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got any cigarettes, Hoppy?" said a voice from below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," replied the joyous puncher, recognizing Pete; "how'd yu git
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like a cow. Busy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None whatever. Comin' up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. Skinny wants a smoke too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong handed tobacco and papers down the hole. "So long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long," replied the daring Pete, who risked death twice for a smoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hot afternoon dragged along and about three o'clock Buck held up an
 empty cartridge belt to the gaze of the curious Hopalong. That observant
 worthy nodded and threw a double handful of cartridges, one by one, to the
 patient and unrelenting Buck, who filled his gun and piled the few
 remaining ones up at his side. "Th' lives of mice and men gang aft all
 wrong," he remarked at random.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' son-of-a-gun's talkin' Shakespeare," marveled Hopalong. "Satiate any,
 Buck?" he asked as that worthy settled down to await his chance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two," he replied, "Shorty an' another. Plenty damn hot down here," he
 complained. A spurt of alkali dust stung his face, but the hand that made
 it never made another. "Three," he called. "How many, Hoppy?"
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "One. That's four. Wonder if th' others got any?"
</pre>
 <p>
 "Pete said Skinny got one," replied the intent Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' son-of-a-gun, he never said nothin' about it, an' me a fillin' his
 ornery paws with smokin'." Hopalong was indignant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bet yu ten we don't git 'em afore dark," he announced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got yu. Go yu ten more I gits another," promptly responded Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a shore cinch. Make her twenty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu'll have to square it with Skinny, he shore wanted Shorty plum' bad,"
 Hopalong informed the unerring marksman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't he say suthin' about it? Anyhow, Jimmy was my bunkie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong's cigarette disintegrated and the board at his left received a
 hole. He promptly disappeared and Buck laughed. He sat up in the loft and
 angrily spat the soaked paper out from between his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All that trouble fer nothin', th' white-eyed coyote," he muttered. Then
 he crawled around to one side and fired at the center of his "C." Another
 shot hurtled at him and his left arm fell to his side. "That's funny?wonder
 where th' damn pirut is?" He looked out cautiously and saw a cloud of
 smoke over a knothole which was situated close up under the eaves of the
 barroom; and it was being agitated. Some one was blowing at it to make it
 disappear. He aimed very carefully at the knot and fired. He heard a sound
 between a curse and a squawk and was not molested any further from that
 point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knowed he'd git hurt," he explained to the bandage, torn from the edge
 of his kerchief, which he carefully bound around his last wound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down in the arroyo Johnny was complaining.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This yer's a no good bunk," he plaintively remarked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore ain't?but it's th' best we kin find," apologized Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's th' sixth that feller sent up there. He's a damn poor shot,"
 observed Johnny; "must be Shorty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shorty kin shoot plum' good?tain't him," contradicted Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yas?with a six-shooter. He's off'n his feed with a rifle,"
 explained Johnny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu wants to stay down from up there, yu ijit," warned Billy as the
 disgusted Johnny crawled up the bank. He slid down again with a welt on
 his neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's somebody else now. He oughter a done better'n that," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy had fired as Johnny started to slide and he smoothed his aggrieved
 chum. "He could onct, yu means."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu git him?" asked the anxious Johnny, rubbing his welt. "Plum'
 center," responded the business-like Billy. "Go up agin, mebby I kin git
 another," he suggested tentatively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby you kin go to blazes. I ain't no gallery," grinned the now
 exuberant owner of the welt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's got the buffalo?" he inquired as the great gun roared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mus' be Cowan. He's shore all right. Sounds like a bloomin' cannon,"
 replied Billy. "Lemme alone with yore fool questions, I'm busy," he
 complained as his talkative partner started to ask another. "Go an' git me
 some water?I'm alkalied. An' git some .45's, mine's purty near
 gone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny crawled down the arroyo and reappeared at Hopalong's barn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he entered the door a handful of empty shells fell on his hat and
 dropped to the floor. He shook his head and remarked, "That mus' be that
 fool Hopalong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore right. How's business?" inquired the festive Cassidy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Purty fair. Billy's got one. How many's gone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buck's got three, I got two and Skinny's got one. That's six, an' Billy
 is seven. They's five more," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd yu know?" queried Johnny as he filled his flask at the horse
 trough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because they's twelve cayuses behind the hotel. That's why."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They might git away on 'em," suggested the practical Johnny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't. They's all cashed in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu said that they's five left," ejaculated the puzzled water carrier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah; yore a smart cuss, ain't yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny grinned and then said, "Got any smokin'?" Hopalong looked grieved.
 "I ain't no store. Why don't yu git generous and buy some?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He partially filled Johnny's hand, and as he put the sadly depleted bag
 away he inquired, "Got any papers?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got any matches?" he asked cynically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kin yu smoke 'em?" he yelled, indignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore nuff," placidly replied the unruffled Johnny. "Billy wants some
 .45-70's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong gasped. "Don't he want my gun, too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. Got a better one. Hurry up, he'll git mad." Hopalong was a very
 methodical person. He was the only one of his crowd to carry a second
 cartridge strap. It hung over his right shoulder and rested on his left
 hip. His waist belt held thirty cartridges for the revolvers. He extracted
 twenty from that part of the shoulder strap hardest to get at, the back,
 by simply pulling it over his shoulder and plucking out the bullets as
 they came into reach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's all yu kin have. I'm Buck's ammernition jackass," he explained.
 "Bet yu ten we gits 'em afore dark"?he was hedging.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any fool knows that. I'll take yu if yu bets th' other way," responded
 Johnny, grinning. He knew Hopalong's weak spot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore on," promptly responded Hopalong, who would bet on anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, so long," said Johnny as he crawled away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu, Johnny!" called out Hopalong, "don't yu go an' tell anybody I
 got any pills left. I ain't no ars'nal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny replied by elevating one foot and waving it. Then he disappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Behind the store, the most precarious position among the besiegers, Red
 Connors and Lanky Smith were ensconced and commanded a view of the entire
 length of the barroom. They could see the dark mass they knew to be the
 rear door and derived a great amount of amusement from the spots of light
 which were appearing in it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They watched the "C" (reversed to them) appear and be completed. When the
 wobbly "H" grew to completion they laughed heartily. Then the hardwood bar
 had been dragged across the field of vision and up to the front windows,
 and they could only see the indiscriminate holes which appeared in the
 upper panels at frequent intervals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every time they fired they had to expose a part of themselves to a return
 shot, with the result that Lanky's forearm was seared its entire length.
 Red had been more fortunate and only had a bruised ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They laboriously rolled several large rocks out in the open, pushing them
 beyond the shelter of the store with their rifles. When they had crawled
 behind them they each had another wound. From their new position they
 could see Hopalong sitting in his window. He promptly waved his sombrero
 and grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were the most experienced fighters of all except Buck, and were
 saving their shots. When they did shoot they always had some portion of a
 man's body to aim at, and the damage they inflicted was considerable. They
 said nothing, being older than the rest and more taciturn, and they were
 not reckless. Although Hopalong's antics made them laugh, they grumbled at
 his recklessness and were not tempted to emulate him. It was noticeable,
 too, that they shoved their rifles out simultaneously and, although both
 were aiming, only one fired. Lanky's gun cracked so close to the enemy's
 that the whirr of the bullet over Red's head was merged in the crack of
 his partner's reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Hopalong saw the rocks roll out from behind the store he grew very
 curious. Then he saw a flash, followed instantly by another from the
 second rifle. He saw several of these follow shots and could sit in
 silence no longer. He waved his hat to attract attention and then shouted,
 "How many?" A shot was sent straight up in the air and he notified Buck
 that there were only four left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fire of these four grew less rapid?they were saving their
 ammunition. A pot shot at Hopalong sent that gentleman's rifle hurtling to
 the ground. Another tore through his hat, removing a neat amount of skin
 and hair and giving him a lifelong part. He fell back inside and proceeded
 to shoot fast and straight with his revolvers, his head burning as though
 on fire. When he had vented the dangerous pressure of his anger he went
 below and tried to fish the rifle in with a long stick. It was obdurate,
 so he sent three more shots into the door, and, receiving no reply, ran
 out around the corner of his shelter and grasped the weapon. When half way
 back he sank to the ground. Before another shot could be fired at him with
 any judgment a ripping, spitting rifle was being frantically worked from
 the barn. The bullets tore the door into seams and gaps; the lowest panel,
 the one having the "H" in it, fell inward in chunks. Johnny had returned
 for another smoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong, still grasping the rifle, rolled rapidly around the corner of
 the barn. He endeavored to stand, but could not. Johnny, hearing rapid and
 fluent swearing, came out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where'd they git yu?" he asked.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "In th' off leg. Hurts like blazes. Did yu git him?"
</pre>
 <p>
 "Nope. I jest come fer another cig; got any left?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Up above. Yore gall is shore apallin'. Help me in, yu two-laigged
 jackass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore. We'll shore pay our 'tentions to that door. She'll go purty soon?she's
 as full of holes as th' Bad Lan's," replied Johnny. "Git aholt an' hop
 along, Hopalong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He helped the swearing Hopalong inside, and then the lead they pumped into
 the wrecked door was scandalous. Another panel fell in and Hopalong's "C"
 was destroyed. A wide crack appeared in the one above it and grew rapidly.
 Its mate began to gape and finally both were driven in. The increase in
 the light caused by these openings allowed Red and Lanky to secure better
 aim and soon the fire of the defenders died out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny dropped his rifle and, drawing his six-shooter, ran out and dashed
 for the dilapidated door, while Hopalong covered that opening with a
 fusilade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Johnny's shoulder sent the framework flying inward he narrowly missed
 sudden death. As it was he staggered to the side, out of range, and
 dropped full length to the ground, flat on his face. Hopalong's rifle
 cracked incessantly, but to no avail. The man who had fired the shot was
 dead. Buck got him immediately after he had shot Johnny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Calling to Skinny and Red to cover him, Buck sprinted to where Johnny lay
 gasping. The bullet had struck his shoulder. Buck, Colt in hand, leaped
 through the door, but met with no resistance. He signaled to Hopalong, who
 yelled, "They's none left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The trees and rocks and gullies and buildings yielded men who soon crowded
 around the hotel. A young doctor, lately graduated, appeared. It was his
 first case, but he eased Johnny. Then he went over to Hopalong, who was
 now raving, and attended to him. The others were patched up as well as
 possible and the struggling young physician had his pockets crammed full
 of gold and silver coins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The scene of the wrecked barroom was indescribable. Holes, furrows,
 shattered glass and bottles, the liquor oozing down the walls of the
 shelves and running over the floor; the ruined furniture, a wrecked bar,
 seared and shattered and covered with blood; bodies as they had been piled
 in the corners; ropes, shells, hats; and liquor everywhere, over
 everything, met the gaze of those who had caused the chaos.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perry's Bend had failed to wipe out the score.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV. The Vagrant Sioux
 </h2>
 <p>
 Buckskin gradually readjusted itself to the conditions which had existed
 before its sudden leap into the limelight as a town which did things. The
 soiree at the Houston House had drifted into the past, and was now
 substantially established as an epoch in the history of the town.
 Exuberant joy gave way to dignity and deprecation, and to solid
 satisfaction; and the conversations across the bar brought forth parallels
 of the affair to be judged impartially?and the impartial judgment
 was, unanimously, that while there had undoubtedly been good fights before
 Perry's Bend had disturbed the local quiet, they were not quite up to the
 new standard of strenuous hospitality. Finally the heat blistered
 everything back into the old state, and the shadows continued to be in
 demand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One afternoon, a month after the reception of the honorable delegation
 from Perry's Bend, the town of Buckskin seemed desolated, and the earth
 and the buildings thereon were as huge furnaces radiating a visible heat,
 but when the blazing sun had begun to settle in the west it awoke with a
 clamor which might have been laid to the efforts of a zealous Satan. At
 this time it became the Mecca of two score or more joyous cowboys from the
 neighboring ranches, who livened things as those knights of the saddle
 could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the scant but heavy shadow of Cowan's saloon sat a picturesque figure
 from whom came guttural, resonant rumblings which mingled in a spirit of
 loneliness with the fretful sighs of a flea-tormented dog. Both dog and
 master were vagrants, and they were tolerated because it was a matter of
 supreme indifference as to who came or how long they stayed as long as the
 ethics and the unwritten law of the cow country were inviolate. And the
 breaking of these caused no unnecessary anxiety, for justice was both
 speedy and sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the outcast Sioux and his yellow dog had drifted into town some few
 months before they had caused neither expostulation nor inquiry, as the
 cardinal virtue of that whole broad land was to ask a man no questions
 which might prove embarrassing to all concerned; judgment was of
 observation, not of history, and a man's past would reveal itself through
 actions. It mattered little whether he was an embezzler or the wild chip
 from some prosperous eastern block, as men came to the range to forget and
 to lose touch with the pampered East; and the range absorbed them as its
 own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man was only a man as his skin contained the qualities necessary; and
 the illiterate who could ride and shoot and live to himself was far more
 esteemed than the educated who could not do those things. The more a man
 depends upon himself and the closer is his contact to a quick judgment the
 more laconic and even-poised he becomes. And the knowledge that he is
 himself a judge tends to create caution and judgment. He has no court to
 uphold his honor and to offer him protection, so he must be quick to
 protect himself and to maintain his own standing. His nature saved him, or
 it executed; and the range absolved him of all unpaid penalties of a
 careless past.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He became a man born again and he took up his burden, the exactions of a
 new environment, and he lived as long as those exactions gave him the
 right to live. He must tolerate no restrictions of his natural rights, and
 he must not restrict; for the one would proclaim him a coward, the other a
 bully; and both received short shrifts in that land of the self-protected.
 The basic law of nature is the survival of the fittest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, when the wanderers found their level in Buckskin they were not even
 asked by what name men knew them. Not caring to hear a name which might
 not harmonize with their idea of the fitness of things, the cowboys of the
 Bar-20 had, with a freedom born of excellent livers and fearless
 temperaments, bestowed names befitting their sense of humor and
 adaptability. The official title of the Sioux was By-and-by; the dog was
 known as Fleas. Never had names more clearly described the objects to be
 represented, for they were excellent examples of cowboy discernment and
 aptitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In their eyes By-and-by was a man. He could feel and he could resent
 insults. They did not class him as one of themselves, because he did not
 have energy enough to demand and justify such classification. With them he
 had a right to enjoy his life as he saw fit so long as he did not trespass
 on or restrict the rights of others. They were not analytic in
 temperament, neither were they moralists. He was not a menace to society,
 because society had superb defenses. So they vaguely recognized his many
 poor qualities and clearly saw his few good ones. He could shoot, when
 permitted, with the best; no horse, however refractory, had ever been
 known to throw him; he was an adept at following the trails left by
 rustlers, and that was an asset; he became of value to the community; he
 was an economic factor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His ability to consume liquor with indifferent effects raised him another
 notch in their estimation. He was not always talking when some one else
 wished to?another count. There remained about him that stoical
 indifference to the petty; that observant nonchalance of the Indian; and
 there was a suggestion, faint, it was true, of a dignity common to
 chieftains. He was a log of grave deference which tossed on their sea of
 mischievous hilarity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wore a pair of corduroy trousers, known to the care-free as "pants,"
 which were held together by numerous patches of what had once been
 brilliantly colored calico. A pair of suspenders, torn into two separate
 straps, made a belt for himself and a collar for his dog. The trousers had
 probably been secured during a fit of absent-mindedness on his part when
 their former owner had not been looking. Tucked at intervals in the top of
 the corduroys (the exceptions making convenient shelves for alkali dust)
 was what at one time had been a stiff-bosomed shirt. This was open down
 the front and back, the weight of the trousers on the belt holding it
 firmly on the square shoulders of the wearer, thus precluding the
 necessity of collar buttons. A pair of moccasins, beautifully worked with
 wampum, protected his feet from the onslaughts of cacti and the
 inquisitive and pugnacious sand flies; and lying across his lap was a
 repeating Winchester rifle, not dangerous because it was empty, a
 condition due to the wisdom of the citizens in forbidding any one to sell,
 trade or give to him those tubes of concentrated trouble, because he could
 get drunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two were contented and happy. They had no cares nor duties, and their
 pleasures were simple and easily secured, as they consisted of sleep and a
 proneness to avoid moving. Like the untrammeled coyote, their bed was
 where sleep overtook them; their food, what the night wrapped in a sense
 of security, or the generosity of the cowboys of the Bar-20. No tub-ridden
 Diogenes ever knew so little of responsibility or as much unadulterated
 content. There is a penalty even to civilization and ambition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the sun had cast its shadows beyond By-and-by's feet the air became
 charged with noise; shouts, shots and the rolling thunder of madly
 pounding hoofs echoed flatly throughout the town. By-and-by yawned,
 stretched and leaned back, reveling in the semi-conscious ecstasy of the
 knowledge that he did not have to immediately get up. Fleas opened one eye
 and cocked an ear in inquiry, and then rolled over on his back, squirmed
 and sighed contentedly and long. The outfit of the Bar-20 had come to
 town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The noise came rapidly nearer and increased in volume as the riders turned
 the corner and drew rein suddenly, causing their mounts to slide on their
 haunches in ankle-deep dust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hullo, old Buck-with-th'-pants, how's yore liver?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come up an irrigate, old tank!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chase th' flea ranch an' trail along!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These were a few of the salutations discernible among the medley of
 playful yells, the safety valves of supercharged good-nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Skr-e-e!" yelled Hopalong Cassidy, letting off a fusillade of shots in
 the vicinity of Fleas, who rapidly retreated around the corner, where he
 wagged his tail in eager expectation. He was not disappointed, for a cow
 pony tore around in pursuit and Hopalong leaned over and scratched the
 yellow back, thumping it heartily, and, tossing a chunk of beef into the
 open jaws of the delighted dog, departed as he had come. The advent of the
 outfit meant a square meal, and the dog knew it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In Cowan's, lined up against the bar, the others were earnestly and
 assiduously endeavoring, with a promise of success, to get By-and-by
 drunk, which endeavors coincided perfectly with By-and-by's idea of the
 fitness of things. The fellowship and the liquor combined to thaw out his
 reserve and to loosen his tongue. After gazing with an air of injured
 surprise at the genial loosening of his knees he gravely handed his rifle
 with an exaggerated sweep of his arm, to the cowboy nearest him, and
 wrapped his arms around the recipient to insure his balance. The rifle was
 passed from hand to hand until it came to Buck Peters, who gravely
 presented it to its owner as a new gun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By-and-by threw out his stomach in an endeavor to keep his head in line
 with his heels, and grasping the weapon with both hands turned to Cowan,
 to whom he gave it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu hab this un. Me got two. Me keep new un, mebby so." Then he loosened
 his belt and drank long and deep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A shadow darkened the doorway and Hopalong limped in. Spying By-and-by
 pushing the bottle into his mouth, while Red Connors propped him, he
 grinned and took out five silver dollars, which he jingled under
 By-and-by's eyes, causing that worthy to lay aside the liquor and
 erratically grab for the tantalizing fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not yet, sabe?" said Hopalong, changing the position of the money. "If yu
 wants to corral this here herd of simoleons yu has to ride a cayuse what
 Red bet me yu can't ride. Yu has got to grow on that there saddle and
 stayed growed for five whole minutes by Buck's ticker. I ain't a-goin' to
 tell yu he's any saw-horse, for yu'd know better, as yu reckons Red
 wouldn't bet on no losin' proposition if he knowed better, which same he
 don't. Yu straddles that four-laigged cloudburst an' yu gets these, sabe?
 I ain't seen th' cayuse yet that yu couldn't freeze to, an' I'm backin' my
 opinions with my moral support an' one month's pay."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By-and-by's eyes began to glitter as the meaning of the words sifted
 through his befuddled mind. Ride a horse?five dollars?ride a
 five-dollars horse?horses ride dollars?then he straightened up
 and began to speak in an incoherent jumble of Sioux and bad English. He,
 the mighty rider of the Sioux; he, the bravest warrior and the greatest
 hunter; could he ride a horse for five dollars? Well, he rather thought he
 could. Grasping Red by the shoulder, he tacked for the door and narrowly
 missed hitting the bottom step first, landing, as it happened, in the soft
 dust with Red's leg around his neck. Somewhat sobered by the jar, he stood
 up and apologized to the crowd for Red getting in the way, declaring that
 Red was a "Heap good un," and that he didn't mean to do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The outfit of the Bar-20 was, perhaps, the most famous of all from Canada
 to the Rio Grande. The foreman, Buck Peters, controlled a crowd of men
 (who had all the instincts of boys) that had shown no quarter to many
 rustlers, and who, while always carefree and easy-going (even fighting
 with great good humor and carelessness), had established the reputation of
 being the most reckless gang of daredevil gun-fighters that ever pounded
 leather. Crooked gaming houses, from El Paso to Cheyenne and from Phoenix
 to Leavenworth, unanimously and enthusiastically damned them from their
 boots to their sombreros, and the sheriffs and marshals of many localities
 had received from their hands most timely assistance?and some
 trouble. Wiry, indomitable, boyish and generous, they were splendid
 examples of virile manhood; and, surrounded as they were with great
 dangers and a unique civilization, they should not, in justice, be judged
 by opinions born of the commonplace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were real cowboys, which means, public opinion to the contrary
 notwithstanding, that they were not lawless, nor drunken, shooting bullies
 who held life cheaply, as their kin has been unjustly pictured; but while
 these men were naturally peaceable they had to continually rub elbows with
 men who were not. Gamblers, criminals, bullies and the riffraff that fled
 from the protected East had drifted among them in great numbers, and it
 was this class that caused the trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hardworking "cow-punchers" lived according to the law of the land, and
 they obeyed that greatest of all laws, that of self-preservation. Their
 fun was boisterous, but they paid for all the damage they inflicted; their
 work was one continual hardship, and the reaction of one extreme swings
 far toward the limit of its antithesis. Go back to the Apple if you would
 trace the beginning of self-preservation and the need.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Peters was a man of mild appearance, somewhat slow of speech and
 correspondingly quick of action, who never became flurried. His was the
 master hand that controlled, and his Colts enjoyed the reputation of never
 missing when a hit could have been expected with reason. Many floods,
 stampedes and blizzards had assailed his nerves, but he yet could pour a
 glass of liquor, held at arm's length, through a knothole in the floor
 without wetting the wood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next in age came Lanky Smith, a small, undersized man of retiring
 disposition. Then came Skinny Thompson, six feet four on his bared soles,
 and true to his name; Hopalong described him as "th' shadow of a chalk
 mark." Pete Wilson, the slow-witted and very taciturn, and Billy Williams,
 the wavering pessimist, were of ordinary height and appearance. Red
 Connors, with hair that shamed the name, was the possessor of a temper
 which was as dry as tinder; his greatest weakness was his regard for the
 rifle as a means of preserving peace. Johnny Nelson was the protege, and
 he could do no wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The last, Hopalong Cassidy, was a combination of irresponsibility, humor,
 good nature, love of fighting, and nonchalance when face to face with
 danger. His most prominent attribute was that of always getting into
 trouble without any intention of so doing; in fact, he was much aggrieved
 and surprised when it came. It seemed as though when any "bad man" desired
 to add to his reputation he invariably selected Hopalong as the means (a
 fact due, perhaps, to the perversity of things in general). Bad men became
 scarce soon after Hopalong became a fixture in any locality. He had been
 crippled some years before in a successful attempt to prevent the
 assassination of a friend, Sheriff Harris, of Albuquerque, and he still
 possessed a limp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Red had relieved his feelings and had dug the alkali out of his ears
 and eyes, he led the Sioux to the rear of the saloon, where a "pinto" was
 busily engaged in endeavoring to pitch a saddle from his back, employing
 the intervals in trying to see how much of the picket rope he could wrap
 around his legs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When By-and-by saw what he was expected to ride he felt somewhat relieved,
 for the pony did not appear to have more than the ordinary amount of
 cussedness. He waved his hand, and Johnny and Red bandaged the animal's
 eyes, which quieted him at once, and then they untangled the rope from
 around his legs and saw that the cinches were secure. Motioning to
 By-and-by that all was ready, they jerked the bandage off as the Indian
 settled himself in the saddle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Had By-and-by been really sober he would have taken the conceit out of
 that pony in chunks, and as it was he experienced no great difficulty in
 holding his seat; but in his addled state of mind he grasped the end of
 the cinch strap in such a way that when the pony jumped forward in its
 last desperate effort the buckle slipped and the cinch became unfastened;
 and By-and-by, still seated in the saddle, flew head foremost into the
 horse trough, where he spilled much water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As this happened Cowan turned the corner, and when he saw the wasted water
 (which he had to carry, bucketful at a time, from the wells a good quarter
 of a mile away) his anger blazed forth, and yelling, he ran for the
 drenched Sioux, who was just crawling out of his bath. When the
 unfortunate saw the irate man bearing down on him he sputtered in rage and
 fear, and, turning, he ran down the street, with Cowan thundering
 flatfootedly behind on a fat man's gallop, to the hysterical cheers of the
 delighted outfit, who saw in it nothing but a good joke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Cowan returned from his hopeless task, blowing and wheezing, he heard
 sundry remarks, sotto voce, which were not calculated to increase his
 opinion of his physical condition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seems to me," remarked the irrepressible Hopalong, "that one of those
 cayuses has got th' heaves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore sounds like it," acquiesced Johnny, red in the face from holding
 in his laughter, "an' say, somebody interferes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All knock-kneed animals do, yu heathen," supplied Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu, let up on that and have a drink on th' house," invited Cowan.
 "If I gits that durn war whoop I'll make yu think there's been a cyclone.
 I'll see how long that bum hangs around this here burg, I will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red's eyes narrowed and his temper got the upper hand. "He ain't no bum
 when yu gives him rotgut at a quarter of a dollar a glass, is he? Any time
 that 'bum' gits razzled out for nothin' more'n this, why, I goes too; an'
 I ain't sayin' nothin' about goin' peaceable?like, neither."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knowed somethin' like this 'ud happen," dolefully sang out Billy
 Williams, strong on the side of his pessimism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For th' Lord's sake, have you broke out?" asked Red, disgustedly. "I'm
 goin' to hit the trail?but just keep this afore yore mind: if
 By-and-by gits in any accidents or ain't in sight when I comes to town
 again, this here climate'll be a heep sight hotter'n it is now. No hard
 feelings, sabe? It's just a casual bit of advice. Come on, fellows, let's
 amble?I'm hungry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they raced across the plain toward the ranch a pair of beady eyes,
 snapping with a drunken rage, watched them from an arroyo; and when Cowan
 entered the saloon the next morning he could not find By-and-by's rifle,
 which he had placed behind the bar. He also missed a handful of cartridges
 from the box near the cash drawer; and had he looked closely at his
 bottled whisky he would have noticed a loss there. A horse was missing
 from a Mexican's corral and there were rumors that several Indians had
 been seen far out on the plain.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V. The Law of the Range
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Phew! I'm shore hungry," said Hopalong, as he and Red dismounted at the
 ranch the next morning for breakfast. "Wonder what's good for it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They's three things that's good for famine," said Red, leading the way to
 the bunk house. "Yu can pull in yore belt, yu can drink, an yu can eat.
 Yore getting as bad as Johnny?but he's young yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others met their entrance with a volley of good-humored banter, some
 of which was so personal and evoked such responses that it sounded like
 the preliminary skirmish to a fight. But under all was that soft accent,
 that drawl of humorous appreciation and eyes twinkling in suppressed
 merriment. Here they were thoroughly at home and the spirit of comradeship
 manifested itself in many subtle ways; the wit became more daring and
 sharp, Billy lost some of his pessimism, and the alertness disappeared
 from their manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Skinny left off romping with Red and yawned. "I wish that cook'ud wake up
 an' git breakfast. He's the cussedest hombre I ever saw?he kin go to
 sleep standin' up an' not know it. Johnny's th' boy that worries him?th'
 kid comes in an' whoops things up till he's gorged himself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Johnny's got th' most appallin' feel for grub of anybody I knows," added
 Red. "I wonder what's keepin' him?he's usually hangin' around here
 bawlin' for his grub like a spoiled calf, long afore cookie's got th' fire
 goin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby he rustled some grub out with him?I saw him tip-toein' out of
 th' gallery this mornin' when I come back for my cigs," remarked Hopalong,
 glancing at Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy groaned and made for the gallery. Emerging half a minute later he
 blurted out his tale of woe: "Every time I blows myself an' don't drink it
 all in town some slab-sided maverick freezes to it. It's gone," he added,
 dismally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too bad, Billy?but what is it?" asked Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it? Wha'd yu think it was, you emaciated match? Jewelry? Cayuses?
 It's whisky?two simoleons' worth. Some-thin's allus wrong. This here
 whole yearth's wrong, just like that cross-eyed sky pilot said over to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will yu let up?" Yelled Red, throwing a sombrero at the grumbling
 unfortunate. "Yu ask Buck where yore tanglefoot is.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd shore look nice askin' th' boss if he'd rustled my whisky, wouldn't
 I? An' would yu mind throwin' somebody else's hat? I paid twenty wheels
 for that eight years ago, and I don't want it mussed none."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gee, yore easy! Why, Ah Sing, over at Albuquerque, gives them away every
 time yu gits yore shirt washed," gravely interposed Hopalong as he went
 out to cuss the cook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what'd yu think of that?" Exclaimed Billy in an injured tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yu needn't be hikin' for Albuquerque?WasheeWashee'ud charge yu
 double for washin' yore shirt. Yu ought to fall in di' river some day?then
 he might talk business," called Hopalong over his shoulder as he heaved an
 old boot into the gallery. "Hey, yu hibernatin' son of morphine, if yu
 don't git them flapjacks in here pretty sudden-like I'll scatter yu all
 over di' landscape, sabe? Yu just wait till Johnny comes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wonder where th' kid is?" asked Lanky, rolling a cigarette. "Off
 somewhere lookin' at di' sun through di' bottom of my bottle," grumbled
 Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong started to go out, but halted on the sill and looked steadily off
 toward the northwest. "That's funny. Hey, fellows, here comes Buck an'
 Johnny ridin' double?on a walk, too!" he exclaimed. "Wonder what th'?thunder!
 Red, Buck's carryun' him! Somethin's busted!" he yelled, as he dashed for
 his pony and made for the newcomers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told yu he was hittin' my bottle," pertly remarked Billy, as he
 followed the rest outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu ever see Johnny drunk? Did yu ever see him drink more'n two
 glasses? Shut yore wailin' face?they's somethin' worse'n that in
 this here," said Red, his temper rising. "Hopalong an' me took yore cheap
 liquor?it's under Pete's bunk," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The trio approached on a walk and Johnny, delirious and covered with
 blood, was carried into the bunk house. Buck waited until all had
 assembled again and then, his face dark with anger, spoke sharply and
 without the usual drawl: "Skragged from behind, blast them! Get some grub
 an' water an' be quick. We'll see who the gent with th' grudge is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this point the expostulations of the indignant cook, who, not
 understanding the cause, regarded the invasion of china shop bulls as
 sacrilegious, came to his ears. Striding quickly to the door, he grabbed
 the pan the Mexican was about to throw and, turning the now frightened man
 around, thundered, "Keep quiet an' get 'em some grub."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When rifles and ammunition had been secured they mounted and followed him
 at a hard gallop along the back trail. No words were spoken, for none were
 necessary. All knew that they would not return until they had found the
 man for whom they were looking, even if the chase led to Canada. They did
 not ask Buck for any of the particulars, for the foreman was not in the
 humor to talk, and all, save Hopalong, whose curiosity was always on edge,
 recognized only two facts and cared for nothing else: Johnny had been
 ambushed and they were going to get the one who was responsible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They did not even conjecture as to who it might be, because the trail
 would lead them to the man himself, and it mattered nothing who or what he
 was?there was only one course to take with an assassin. So they said
 nothing, but rode on with squared jaws and set lips, the seven ponies
 breast to breast in a close arc.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon they came to an arroyo which they took at a leap. As they approached
 it they saw signs in the dust which told them that a body had lain there
 huddled up; and there were brown spots on the baked alkali. The trail they
 followed was now single, Buck having ridden along the bank of the arroyo
 when hunting for Johnny, for whom he had orders. This trail was very
 irregular, as if the horse had wandered at will. Suddenly they came upon
 five tracks, all pointing one way, and four of these turned abruptly and
 disappeared in the northwest. Half a mile beyond the point of separation
 was a chaparral, which was an important factor to them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each man knew just what had taken place as if he had been an eyewitness,
 for the trail was plain. The assassins had waited in the chaparral for
 Johnny to pass, probably having seen him riding that way. When he had
 passed and his back had been turned to them they had fired and wounded him
 severely at the first volley, for Johnny was of the stuff that fights back
 and his revolvers had showed full chambers and clean barrels when Red had
 examined them in the bunk house. Then they had given chase for a short
 distance and, from some inexplicable motive, probably fear, they had
 turned and ridden off without knowing how bad he was hit. It was this
 trail that led to the northwest, and it was this trail that they followed
 without pausing.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">When they had covered fifty miles they sighted the Cross Bar O ranch
where they hoped to secure fresh mounts. As they rode up to the ranch
house the owner, Bud Wallace, came around the corner and saw them.

 "Hullo, boys! What deviltry are yu up to now?" he asked. Buck
leaped from his mount, followed by the others, and shoved his sombrero
back on his head as he started to remove the saddle.
</pre>
 <p>
 "We're trailin' a bunch of murderers. They ambushed Johnny an' blame near
 killed him. I stopped here to get fresh cayuses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu did right!" replied Wallace heartily. Then raising his voice he
 shouted to some of his men who were near the corral to bring up the seven
 best horses they could rope. Then he told the cook to bring out plenty of
 food and drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got four punchers what ain't doin' nothin' but eat," he suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Much obliged, Wallace, but there's only four of 'em, an' we'd rather get
 'em ourselves?Johnny'ud feel better," replied Buck, throwing his
 saddle on the horse that was led up to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's yore cartridges?got plenty?" Persisted Wallace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two hundred apiece," responded Buck, springing into his saddle and riding
 off. "So long," he called.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long, an' plug blazes out of them," shouted Wallace as the dust swept
 over him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At five in the afternoon they forded the Black River at a point where it
 crossed the state line from New Mexico, and at dusk camped at the base of
 the Guadalupe Mountains. At daybreak they took up the chase, grim and
 merciless, and shortly afterward they passed the smoldering remains of a
 camp fire, showing that the pursued had been in a great hurry, for it
 should have been put out and masked. At noon they left the mountains to
 the rear and sighted the Barred Horeshoe, which they approached.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The owner of the ranch saw them coming, and from their appearance surmised
 that something was wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" He shouted. "Rustlers?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. Murderers. I wants to swap cayuses quick," answered Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There they are. Th' boys just brought 'em in. Anything else I can let yu
 have?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope," shouted Buck as they galloped off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Somebody's goin' to get plugged full of holes," murmured the ranch owner
 as he watched them kicking up the dust in huge clouds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After they had forded a tributary of the Rio Penasco near the Sacramento
 Mountains and had surmounted the opposite bank, Hopalong spurred his horse
 to the top of a hummock and swept the plain with Pete's field glasses,
 which he had borrowed for the occasion, and returned to the rest, who had
 kept on without slacking the pace. As he took up his former position he
 grunted, "War-whoops," and unslung his rifle, an example followed by the
 others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ponies were now running at top speed, and as they shot over a rise
 their riders saw their quarry a mile and a half in advance. One of the
 Indians looked back and discharged his rifle in defiance, and it now
 became a race worthy of the name?Death fled from Death. The fresher
 mounts of the cowboys steadily cut down the distance and, as the rifles of
 the pursuers began to speak, the hard-pressed Indians made for the smaller
 of two knolls, the plain leading to the larger one being too heavily
 strewn with bowlders to permit speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the fugitives settled down behind the rocks which fringed the edge of
 their elevation a shot from one of them disabled Billy's arm, but had no
 other effect than to increase the score to be settled. The pursuers rode
 behind a rise and dismounted, from where, leaving their mounts protected,
 they scattered out to surround the knoll.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong, true to his curiosity, finally turned up on the highest point of
 the other knoll, a spur of the range in the west, for he always wanted to
 see all he could. Skinny, due to his fighting instinct, settled one
 hundred yards to the north and on the same spur. Buck lay hidden behind an
 enormous bowlder eight hundred yards to the northeast of Skinny, and the
 same distance southeast of Buck was Red Connors, who was crawling up the
 bed of an arroyo. Billy, nursing his arm, lay in front of the horses, and
 Pete, from his position between Billy and Hopalong, was crawling from rock
 to rock in an endeavor to get near enough to use his Colts, his favorite
 and most effective weapons. Intermittent puffs of smoke arising from a
 point between Skinny and Buck showed where Lanky Smith was improving each
 shining hour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There had been no directions given, each man choosing his own position,
 yet each was of strategic worth. Billy protected the horses, Hopalong and
 Skinny swept the knoll with a plunging fire, and Lanky and Buck lay in the
 course the besieged would most likely take if they tried a dash. Off to
 the east Red barred them from creeping down the arroyo, and from where
 Pete was he could creep up to within sixty yards if he chose the right
 rocks. The ranges varied from four hundred yards for Buck to sixty for
 Pete, and the others averaged close to three hundred, which allowed very
 good shooting on both sides.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong and Skinny gradually moved nearer to each other for
 companionship, and as the former raised his head to see what the others
 were doing he received a graze on the ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wow!" he yelled, rubbing the tingling member.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two puffs of smoke floated up from the knoll, and Skinny swore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where'd he get yu, Fat?" asked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "G'wan, don't get funny, son," replied Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jets of smoke arose from the north and east, where Buck and Red were
 stationed, and Pete was half way to the knoll. So far he hadn't been hit
 as he dodged in and out, and, emboldened by his luck, he made a run of
 five yards and his sombrero was shot from his head. Another dash and his
 empty holster was ripped from its support. As he crouched behind a rock he
 heard a yell from Hopalong, and saw that interested individual waving his
 sombrero to cheer him on. An angry pang! from the knoll caused that
 enthusiastic rooter to drop for safety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Locoed son-of-a-gun," complained Pete. "He'll shore git potted." Then he
 glanced at Billy, who was the center of several successive spurts of dust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's business, Billy?" he called pleasantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, they'll git me yet," responded the pessimist. "Yu needn't git
 anxious. If that off buck wasn't so green he'd 'a' had me long ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-hoo! Pete! Oh, Pete!" called Hopalong, sticking his head out at one
 side and grinning as the wondering object of his hail craned his neck to
 see what the matter was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huh?" grunted Pete, and then remembering the distance he shouted, "What's
 th' matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got any cigarettes?" asked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu poor sheep!" said Pete, and turning back to work he drove a .45 into a
 yellow moccasin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong began to itch and he saw that he was near an ant hill. Then the
 cactus at his right boomed out mournfully and a hole appeared in it. He
 fired at the smoke and a yell informed him that he had made a hit. "Go
 'way!" he complained as a green fly buzzed past his nose. Then he
 scratched each leg with the foot of the other and squirmed incessantly,
 kicking out with both feet at once. A warning metallic whir-r-r! on his
 left caused to yank them in again, and turning his head quickly he the
 pleasure of lopping off the head of a rattlesnake with his Colt's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Glad yu wasn't a copperhead," he exclaimed. "Somebody had ought 'a' shot
 that fool Noah. Blast the ants!" He drowned with a jet of tobacco juice a
 Gila monster that was staring at him and took a savage delight in its
 frantic efforts to bury itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon he heard Skinny swear and he sung out: "What's the matter, Skinny?
 Git plugged again?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Naw, bugs?ain't they mean?" Plaintively asked his friend. "They
 ain't none over here. What kind of bugs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sufferin' Moses, I ain't no bugologist! All kinds!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Hopalong got it at last. He had found tobacco and rolled a cigarette,
 and in reaching for a match exposed his shoulder to a shot that broke his
 collar bone. Skinny's rifle cracked in reply and the offending brave
 rolled out from behind a rock. From the fuss emanating from Hopalong's
 direction Skinny knew that his neighbor had been hit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't yu care, Hoppy. I got th' cuss," he said consolingly. "Where'd he
 git yu?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In di' heart, yu pie-faced nuisance. Come over here an' corral this
 cussed bandage an' gimme some water," snapped the injured man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Skinny wormed his way through the thorny chaparral and bound up the
 shoulder. "Anything else?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Shoot that bunch of warts an' blow that tobacco-eyed Gila to
 Cheyenne. This here's worse than the time we cleaned out th' C 80 outfit!"
 Then he kicked the dead toad and swore at the sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Close yore yap; yore worse than a kid! Anybody'd think yu never got
 plugged afore," said Skinny indignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can cuss all I wants," replied Hopalong, proving his assertion as he
 grabbed his gun and fired at the dead Indian. A bullet whined above his
 head and Skinny fired at the smoke. He peeped out and saw that his friends
 were getting nearer to the knoll.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They's closin' in now. We'll soon be gittin' home," he reported.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong looked out in time to see Buck make a dash for a bowlder that lay
 ten yards in front of him, which he reached in safety. Lanky also ran in
 and Pete added five more yards to his advance. Buck made another dash, but
 leaped into the air, and, coming down as if from an intentional high jump,
 staggered and stumbled for a few paces and then fell flat, rolling over
 and over toward the shelter of a split rock, where he lay quiet. A leering
 red face peered over the rocks on the knoll, but the whoop of exultation
 was cut short, for Red's rifle cracked and the warrior rolled down the
 steep bank, where another shot from the same gun settled him beyond
 question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong choked and, turning his face away, angrily dashed his knuckles
 into his eyes. "Blast 'em! Blast 'em! They've got Buck! They've got Buck,
 blast 'em! They've got Buck, Skinny! Good old Buck! They've got him!
 Jimmy's gone, Johnny's plugged, and now Buck's gone! Come on!" he sobbed
 in a frenzy of vengeance. "Come on, Skinny! We'll tear their cussed hides
 into a deeper red than they are now! Oh, blast it, I can't see?where's
 my gun?" He groped for the rifle and fought Skinny when the latter,
 red-eyed but cool, endeavored to restrain him. "Lemme go, curse yu! Don't
 yu know they got Buck? Lemme go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Down! Red's got di' skunk. Yu can't do nothin'?they'd drop yu afore
 yu took five steps. Red's got him, I tell yu! Do yu want me to lick yu?
 We'll pay 'em back with interest if yu'll keep yore head!" exclaimed
 Skinny, throwing the crazed man heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Musical tones, rising and falling in weird octaves, whining pityingly,
 diabolically, sobbing in a fascinating monotone and slobbering in ragged
 chords, calling as they swept over the plain, always calling and
 exhorting, they mingled in barbaric discord with the defiant barks of the
 six-shooters and the inquiring cracks of the Winchesters. High up in the
 air several specks sailed and drifted, more coming up rapidly from all
 directions. Buzzards know well where food can be found.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Hopalong leaned back against a rock he was hit in the thigh by a
 ricochet that tore its way out, whirling like a circular saw, a span above
 where it entered. The wound was very nasty, being ripped twice the size
 made by an ordinary shot, and it bled profusely. Skinny crawled over and
 attended to it, making a tourniquet of his neckerchief and clumsily
 bandaging it with a strip torn from his shirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore lucky, yu are," he grumbled as he made his way back to his
 post, where he vented his rancor by emptying the semi-depleted magazine of
 his Winchester at the knoll.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong began to sing and shout and he talked of Jimmy and his childhood,
 interspersing the broken narrative with choice selections as sung in the
 music halls of Leavenworth and Abilene. He wound up by yelling and
 struggling, and Skinny had his hands full in holding him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hopalong! Cassidy! Come out of that! Keep quiet?yu'll shore git
 plugged if yu don't stop that plungin'. For gosh sake, did yu hear that?"
 A bullet viciously hissed between them and flattened out on a near-by
 rock; others cut their way through the chaparral to the sound of falling
 twigs, and Skinny threw himself on the struggling man and strapped
 Hopalong with his belt to the base of a honey mesquite that grew at his
 side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold still, now, and let that bandage alone. Yu allus goes off di' range
 when yu gets plugged," he complained. He cut down a cactus and poured the
 sap over the wounded man's face, causing him to gurgle and look around.
 His eyes had a sane look now and Skinny slid off his chest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Git that?belt loose; I ain't?no cow," brokenly blazed out the
 picketed Hopalong. Skinny did so, handed the irate man his Colts and
 returned to his own post, from where he fired twice, reporting the shots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm tryin' to get him on th' glance' first one went high an' th' other
 fell flat," he explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong listened eagerly, for this was shooting that he could appreciate.
 "Lemme see," he commanded. Skinny dragged him over to a crack and settled
 down for another try.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is he, Skinny?" Asked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Behind that second big one. No, over on this here side. See that smooth
 granite? If I can get her there on th' right spot he'll shore know it." He
 aimed carefully and fired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Through Pete's glasses Hopalong saw a leaden splotch appear on the rock
 and he notified the marksman that he was shooting high. "Put her on that
 bump closer down," he suggested. Skinny did so and another yell reached
 their ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a dandy. Yore shore all right, yu old cuss," complimented
 Hopalong, elated at the success of the experiment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Skinny fired again and a brown arm flopped out into sight. Another shot
 struck it and it jerked as though it were lifeless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's cashed. See how she jumped? Like a rope," remarked Skinny with a
 grin. The arm lay quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pete had gained his last cover and was all eyes and Colts. Lanky was also
 very close in and was intently watching one particular rock. Several shots
 echoed from the far side of the knoll and they knew that Red was all
 right. Billy was covering a cluster of rocks that protruded above the
 others and, as they looked, his rifle rang out and the last defender
 leaped down and disappeared in the chaparral. He wore yellow trousers and
 an old boiled shirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By an'-by, by all that's bad!" yelled Hopalong. "Th' measly coyote! An'
 me a-fillin' his ornery hide with liquor. Well, they'll have to find him
 all over again now," he complained, astounded by the revelation. He fired
 into the chaparral to express his pugnacious disgust and scared out a huge
 tarantula, which alighted on Skinny's chaps, crawling rapidly toward the
 unconscious man's neck. Hopalong's face hardened and he slowly covered the
 insect and fired, driving it into the sand, torn and lifeless. The bullet
 touched the leathern garment and Skinny remonstrated, knowing that
 Hopalong was in no condition for fancy shooting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huh!" exclaimed Hopalong. "That was a tarantula what I plugged. He was
 headin' for yore neck," he explained, watching the chaparral with
 apprehension.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go 'way, was it? Bully for yu!" exclaimed Skinny, tarantulas being placed
 at par with rattlesnakes, and he considered that he had been saved from a
 horrible death. "Thought yu said they wasn't no bugs over here," he added
 in an aggrieved tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They wasn't none. Yu brought 'em. I only had th' main show?Gilas,
 rattlers an' toads," he replied, and then added, "Ain't it cussed hot up
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is. Yu won't have no cinch ridin' home with that leg. Yu better take
 my cayuse?he's busted more'n yourn," responded Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore cayuse is at th' Cross Bar O, yu wall-eyed pirute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore 'nuff. Funny how a feller forgets sometimes. Lemme alone now,
 they's goin' to git By-an'-by. Pete an' Lanky has just went in after him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was what had occurred. The two impatient punchers, had grown tired of
 waiting, and risked what might easily have been death in order to hasten
 matters. The others kept up a rapid fire, directed at the far end of the
 chaparral on the knoll, in order to mask the movements of their
 venturesome friends, intending also to drive By-and-by toward them so that
 he would be the one to get picked off as he advanced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several shots rang out in quick succession on the knoll and the chaparral
 became agitated. Several more shots sounded from the depth of the thicket
 and a mounted Indian dashed out of the northern edge and headed in Buck's
 direction. His course would take him close to Buck, whom he had seen fall,
 and would let him escape at a point midway between Red and Skinny, as
 Lanky was on the knoll and the range was very far to allow effective
 shooting by these two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red saw him leave the chaparral and in his haste to reload jammed the
 cartridge, and By-and-by swept on toward temporary safety, with Red
 dancing in a paroxysm of rage, swelling his vocabulary with words he had
 forgotten existed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By-and-by, rising to his full height in the saddle, turned and wiggled his
 fingers at the frenzied Red and made several other signs that the cowboy
 was in the humor to appreciate to the fullest extent. Then he turned and
 shook his rifle at the marksmen on the larger knoll, whose best shots
 kicked up the dust fully fifty yards too short. The pony was sweeping
 toward the reservation and friends only fifteen miles away, and By-and-by
 knew that once among the mountains he would be on equal footing at least
 with his enemies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he passed the rock behind which Buck lay sprawled on his face he
 uttered a piercing whoop of triumph and leaned forward on his pony's neck.
 Twenty leaps farther and the spiteful crack of a rifle echoed from where
 the foreman was painfully supporting himself on his elbows. The pony swept
 on in a spurt of nerve-racking speed, but alone. By-and-by shrieked again
 and crashed heavily to the ground, where he rolled inertly and then lay
 still. Men like Buck are dangerous until their hearts have ceased to beat.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI. Trials of the Convalescent
 </h2>
 <p>
 The days at the ranch passed in irritating idleness for those who had
 obstructed the flight of hostile lead, and worse than any of the patients
 was Hopalong, who fretted and fumed at his helplessness, which retarded
 his recovery. But at last the day came when he was fit for the saddle
 again, and he gave notice of his joy in whoops and forthwith announced
 that he was entitled to a holiday; and Buck had not the heart to refuse
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he started forth in his quest of peace and pleasure, but instead had
 found only trouble and had been forced to leave his card at almost every
 place he had visited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was that affair in Red Hot Gulch, Colorado, where, under pressure,
 he had invested sundry pieces of lead in the persons of several
 obstreperous citizens and then had paced the zealous and excitable sheriff
 to the state line.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He next was noticed in Cheyenne, where his deformity was vividly dwelt
 upon, to the extent of six words, by one Tarantula Charley, the aforesaid
 Charley not being able to proceed to greater length on account of heart
 failure. As Charley had been a ubiquitous nuisance, those present availed
 themselves of the opportunity offered by Hopalong to indulge in a free
 drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Laramie was his next stopping place, and shortly after his arrival he was
 requested to sing and dance by a local terror, who informed all present
 that he was the only seventeen-buttoned rattlesnake in the cow country.
 Hopalong, hurt and indignant at being treated like a common tenderfoot,
 promptly knocked the terror down. After he had irrigated several square
 feet of parched throats belonging to the audience he again took up his
 journey and spent a day at Denver, where he managed to avoid any further
 trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Santa Fe loomed up before him several days later and he entered it shortly
 before noon. At this time the old Spanish city was a bundle of high-strung
 nerves, and certain parts of it were calculated to furnish any and all
 kinds of excitement except revival meetings and church fairs. Hopalong
 straddled a lively nerve before he had been in the city an hour. Two local
 bad men, Slim Travennes and Tex Ewalt, desiring to establish the fact that
 they were roaring prairie fires, attempted to consume the placid and
 innocent stranger as he limped across the plaza in search of a game of
 draw poker at the Black Hills Emporium, with the result that they needed
 repairs, to the chagrin and disgust of their immediate acquaintances, who
 endeavored to drown their mortification and sorrow in rapid but somewhat
 wild gun play, and soon remembered that they had pressing engagements
 elsewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong reloaded his guns and proceeded to the Emporium, where he found a
 game all prepared for him in every sense of the word. On the third deal he
 objected to the way in which the dealer manipulated the cards, and when
 the smoke cleared away he was the only occupant of the room, except a dog
 belonging to the bartender that had intercepted a stray bullet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hunting up the owner of the hound, he apologized for being the indirect
 cause of the animal's death, deposited a sum of Mexican dollars in that
 gentleman's palm and went on his way to Alameda, which he entered shortly
 after dark, and where an insult, simmering in its uncalled-for venom, met
 him as he limped across the floor of the local dispensary on his way to
 the bar. There was no time for verbal argument and precedent had
 established the manner of his reply, and his repartee was as quick as
 light and most effective. Having resented the epithets he gave his
 attention to the occupants of the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Smoke drifted over the table in an agitated cloud and dribbled lazily
 upward from the muzzle of his six-shooter, while he looked searchingly at
 those around him. Strained and eager faces peered at his opponent, who was
 sliding slowly forward in his chair, and for the length of a minute no
 sound but the guarded breathing of the onlookers could be heard. This was
 broken by a nervous cough from the rear of the room, and the faces assumed
 their ordinary nonchalant expressions, their rugged lines heavily shadowed
 in the light of the flickering oil lamps, while the shuffling of cards and
 the clink of silver became audible. Hopalong Cassidy had objected to
 insulting remarks about his affliction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong was very sensitive about his crippled leg and was always prompt
 to resent any scorn or curiosity directed at it, especially when emanating
 from strangers. A young man of twenty-three years, when surrounded by
 nearly perfect specimens of physical manhood, is apt to be painfully
 self-conscious of any such defect, and it reacted on his nature at times,
 even though he was well-known for his happy-go-lucky disposition and
 playfulness. He consoled himself with the knowledge that what he lost in
 symmetry was more than balanced by the celerity and certainty of his gun
 hand, which was right or left, or both, as the occasion demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several hours later, as his luck was vacillating, he felt a heavy hand on
 his shoulder, and was overjoyed at seeing Buck and Red, the latter
 grinning as only Red could grin, and he withdrew from the game to enjoy
 his good fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While Hopalong had been wandering over the country the two friends had
 been hunting for him and had traced him successfully, that being due to
 the trail he had blazed with his six-shooters. This they had accomplished
 without harm to themselves, as those of whom they inquired thought that
 they must want Hopalong "bad," and cheerfully gave the information
 required.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had started out more for the purpose of accompanying him for
 pleasure, but that had changed to an urgent necessity in the following
 manner:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While on the way from Denver to Santa Fe they had met Pete Willis of the
 Three Triangle, a ranch that adjoined their own, and they paused to pass
 the compliments of the season.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Purty far from th' grub wagon, Pie," remarked Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'm only goin' to Denver," responded Pie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Purty hot," suggested Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She shore is. Seen anybody yu knows?" Pie asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One or two?Billy of th' Star Crescent an' Panhandle Lukins,"
 answered Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That so? Panhandle's goin' to punch for us next year. I'll hunt him up. I
 heard down south of Albuquerque that Thirsty Jones an' his brothers are
 lookin' for trouble," offered Pie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah! They ain't lookin' for no trouble?they just goes around
 blowin' off. Trouble? Why, they don't know what she is," remarked Red
 contemptuously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they's been dodgin' th' sheriff purty lively lately, an' if that
 ain't trouble I don't know what is," said Pie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore is, an' hard to dodge," acquiesced Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I has to amble. Is Panhandle in Denver? Yes? I calculates as how me
 an' him'll buck th' tiger for a whirl?he's shore lucky. Well, so
 long," said Pie as he moved on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long," responded the two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, wait a minute," yelled Pie after he had ridden a hundred yards. "If
 yu sees Hopalong yu might tell him that th' Joneses are goin' to hunt him
 up when they gits to Albuquerque. They's shore sore on him. 'Tain't none
 of my funeral, only they ain't always a-carin' how they goes after a
 feller. So long," and soon he was a cloud of dust on the horizon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trouble!" snorted Red; "well, between dodgin' Harris an' huntin' Hopalong
 I reckons they'll shore find her." Then to himself he murmured, "Funny how
 everythin' comes his way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's gospel shore enough, but, as Pie said, they ain't a whole lot
 particular as how they deal th' cards. We better get a move on an' find
 that ornery little cuss," replied Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O. K., only I ain't losin' no sleep about Hoppy. His gun's too lively for
 me to do any worryin'," asserted Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll get lynched some time, shore," declared Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not if they find Hoppy," grimly replied Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They tore through Santa Fe, only stopping long enough to wet their
 throats, and after several hours of hard riding entered Alameda, where
 they found Hopalong in the manner narrated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After some time the three left the room and headed for Albuquerque, twelve
 miles to the south. At ten o'clock they dismounted before the Nugget and
 Rope, an unpainted wooden building supposed to be a clever combination of
 barroom, dance and gambling hall and hotel. The cleverness lay in the man
 who could find the hotel part.
 </p><br>
 <p>

 <br><br><br><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII. The Open Door
 </h2>
 <p>
 The proprietor of the Nugget and Rope, a German named Baum, not being
 troubled with police rules, kept the door wide open for the purpose of
 inviting trade, a proceeding not to the liking of his patrons for obvious
 reasons. Probably not one man in ten was fortunate enough to have no one
 "looking for him," and the lighted interior assured good hunting to any
 one in the dark street. He was continually opening the door, which every
 newcomer promptly and forcibly slammed shut. When he saw men walk across
 the room for the express purpose of slamming it he began to cherish the
 idea that there was a conspiracy on foot to anger him and thus force him
 to bring about his own death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After the door had been slammed three times in one evening by one man, the
 last slam being so forcible as to shake two bottles from the shelf and to
 crack the door itself, he became positive that his suspicions were
 correct, and so was very careful to smile and take it as a joke. Finally,
 wearied by his vain efforts to keep it open and fearing for the door, he
 hit upon a scheme, the brilliancy of which inflated his chest and gave him
 the appearance of a prize-winning bantam. When his patrons strolled in
 that night there was no door to slam, as it lay behind the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Buck and Red entered, closely followed by Hopalong, they elbowed
 their way to the rear of the room, where they could see before being seen.
 As yet they had said nothing to Hopalong about Pie's warning and were
 debating in their minds whether they should do so or not, when Hopalong
 interrupted their thoughts by laughing. They looked up and he nodded
 toward the front, where they saw that anxious eyes from all parts of the
 room were focused on the open door. Then they noticed that it had been
 removed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The air of semi-hostile, semi-anxious inquiry of the patrons and the smile
 of satisfaction covering the face of Baum appealed to them as the most
 ludicrous sight their eyes had seen for months, and they leaned back and
 roared with laughter, thus calling forth sundry looks of disapproval from
 the innocent causes of their merriment. But they were too well known in
 Albuquerque to allow the disapproval to approach a serious end, and
 finally, as the humorous side of the situation dawned on the crowd, they
 joined in the laugh and all went merrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the psychologic moment some one shouted for a dance and the suggestion
 met with uproarious approval. At that moment Harris, the sheriff, came in
 and volunteered to supply the necessary music if the crowd would pay the
 fine against a straying fiddler he had corraled the day before. A hat was
 quickly passed and a sum was realized which would pay several fines to
 come and Harris departed for the music.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A chair was placed on the bar for the musician and, to the tune of "Old
 Dan Tucker" and an assortment of similar airs, the board floor shook and
 trembled. It was a comical sight and Hopalong, the only wallflower besides
 Baum and the sheriff, laughed until he became weak. Cow punchers play as
 they work, hard and earnestly, and there was plenty of action. Sombreros
 flapped like huge wings and the baggy chaps looked like small, distorted
 balloons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Virginia reel was a marvel of supple, exaggerated grace and the
 quadrille looked like a free-for-all for unbroken colts. The honor of
 prompter was conferred upon the sheriff, and he gravely called the changes
 as they were usually called in that section of the country:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Oh, th' ladies trail in
 An' th' gents trail out,
 An' all stampede down th' middle.
 If yu ain't got th' tin
 Yu can dance an' shout,
 But yu must keep up with th' fiddle."
</pre>
 <p>
 As the dance waxed faster and the dancers grew hotter Hopalong, feeling
 lonesome because he wouldn't face ridicule, even if it was not expressed,
 went over and stood by the sheriff. He and Harris were good friends, for
 he had received the wound that crippled him in saving the sheriff from
 assassination. Harris killed the man who had fired that shot, and from
 this episode on the burning desert grew a friendship that was as strong as
 their own natures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Harris was very well liked by the majority and feared by the rest, for he
 was a square man and the best sheriff the county had ever known. Quiet and
 unassuming, small of stature and with a kind word for every one, he was a
 universal favorite among the better class of citizens. Quick as a flash
 and unerring in his shooting, he was a nightmare to the "bad men." No
 profane word had ever been known to leave his lips, and he was the
 possessor of a widespread reputation for generosity. His face was
 naturally frank and open; but when his eyes narrowed with determination it
 became blank and cold. When he saw his young friend sidle over to him he
 smiled and nodded a hearty welcome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They's shore cuttin' her loose," remarked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First two pairs forward an' back!?they shore is," responded the
 prompter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's th' gent playin' lady to Buck?" Queried Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forward again an' ladies change!?Billy Jordan."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong watched the couple until they swung around and then he laughed
 silently. "Buck's got too many feet," he seriously remarked to his friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swing th' girl yu loves th' best!?he ain't lonesome, look at that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two shots rang out in quick succession and Harris stumbled, wheeled and
 pitched forward on his face as Hopalong's sombrero spun across his body.
 For a second there was an intense silence, heavy, strained and sickening.
 Then a roar broke forth and the crowd of frenzied merry-makers, headed by
 Hopalong, poured out into the street and spread out to search the town. As
 daylight dawned the searchers began to straggle back with the same report
 of failure. Buck and Red met on the street near the door and each looked
 questioningly at the other. Each shook his head and looked around, their
 fingers toying absentmindedly at their belts. Finally Buck cleared his
 throat and remarked casually,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby he's following 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red nodded and they went over toward their horses. As they were hesitating
 which route to take, Billy Jordan came up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby yu'd like to see yore pardner?he's out by Buzzard's Spring.
 We'll take care of him," jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward the
 saloon where Harris's body lay. "And we'll all git th' others later. They
 cain't git away for long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck and Red nodded and headed for Buzzard's Spring. As they neared the
 water hole they saw Hopalong sitting on a rock, his head resting in one
 hand while the other hung loosely from his knee. He did not notice them
 when they arrived, and with a ready tact they sat quietly on their horses
 and looked in every direction except toward him. The sun became a ball of
 molten fire and the sand flies annoyed them incessantly, but still they
 sat and waited, silent and apologetic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong finally arose, reached for his sombrero, and, finding it gone,
 swore long and earnestly at the scene its loss brought before him. He
 walked over to his horse and, leaping into the saddle, turned and faced
 his friends. "Yu old sons-of-guns," he said. They looked sheepish and
 nodded negatively in answer to the look of inquiry in his eyes. "They
 ain't got 'em yet," remarked Red slowly. Hopalong straightened up, his
 eyes narrowed and his face became hard and resolute as he led the way back
 toward the town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck rode up beside him and, wiping his face with his shirt sleeve, began
 to speak to Red. "We might look up th' Joneses, Red. They had been dodgin'
 th' sheriff purty lively lately, an' they was huntin' Hopalong. Ever since
 we had to kill their brother in Buckskin they has been yappin' as how they
 was goin' to wipe us out. Hopalong an' Harris was standin' clost together
 an' they tried for both. They shot twice, one for Harris an' one for
 Hopalong, an' what more do yu want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore looks thataway, Buck," replied Red, biting into a huge plug of
 tobacco which he produced from his chaps. "Anyhow, they wouldn't be no
 loss if they didn't. Member what Pie said?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong looked straight ahead, and when he spoke the words sounded as
 though he had bitten them off: "Yore right, Buck, but I gits first try at
 Thirsty. He's my meat an' I'll plug th' fellow what says he ain't. Damn
 him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others replied by applying their spurs, and in a short time they
 dismounted before the Nugget and Rope. Thirsty wouldn't have a chance to
 not care how he dealt the cards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck and Red moved quickly through the crowd, speaking fast and earnestly.
 When they returned to where they had left their friend they saw him half a
 block away and they followed slowly, one on either side of the street.
 There would be no bullets in his back if they knew what they were about,
 and they usually did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Hopalong neared the corner, Thirsty and his two brothers turned it and
 saw him. Thirsty said something in a low voice, and the other two walked
 across the street and disappeared behind the store. When assured that they
 were secure, Thirsty walked up to a huge boulder on the side of the street
 farthest from the store and turned and faced his enemy, who approached
 rapidly until about five paces away, when he slowed up and finally
 stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a number of seconds they sized each other up, Hopalong quiet and
 deliberate with a deadly hatred; Thirsty pale and furtive with a sensation
 hitherto unknown to him. It was Right meeting Wrong, and Wrong lost
 confidence. Often had Thirsty Jones looked death in the face and laughed,
 but there was something in Hopalong's eyes that made his flesh creep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He glanced quickly past his foe and took in the scene with one flash of
 his eyes. There was the crowd, eager, expectant, scowling. There were Buck
 and Red, each lounging against a boulder, Buck on his right, Red on his
 left. Before him stood the only man he had ever feared. Hopalong shifted
 his feet and Thirsty, coming to himself with a start, smiled. His nerve
 had been shaken, but he was master of himself once more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" he snarled, scowling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong made no response, but stared him in the eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thirsty expected action, and the deadly quiet of his enemy oppressed him.
 He stared in turn, but the insistent searching of his opponent's eyes
 scorched him and he shifted his gaze to Hopalong's neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" he repeated uneasily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu have a nice time at th' dance last night?" Asked Hopalong, still
 searching the face before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was there a dance? I was over in Alameda," replied Thirsty shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as, there was a dance, an' yu can shoot purty durn far if yu was in
 Alameda," responded Hopalong, his voice low and monotonous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thirsty shifted his feet and glanced around. Buck and Red were still
 lounging against their bowlders and apparently were not paying any
 attention to the proceedings. His fickle nerve came back again, for he
 knew he would receive fair play. So he faced Hopalong once more and
 regarded him with a cynical smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu seems to worry a whole lot about me. Is it because yu has a tender
 feelin', or because it's none of yore blame business?" He asked
 aggressively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong paled with sudden anger, but controlled himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because yu murdered Harris," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shoo! An' how does yu figger it out?" Asked Thirsty, jauntily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was huntin' yu hard an' yu thought yu'd stop it, so yu came in to lay
 for him. When yu saw me an' him together yu saw di' chance to wipe out
 another score. That's how I figger it out," replied Hopalong quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore a reg'lar 'tective, ain't yu?" Thirsty asked ironically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got common sense," responded Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu has? Yu better tell th' rest that, too," replied Thirsty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know yu shot Harris, an' yu can't get out of it by makin' funny
 remarks. Anyhow, yu won't be much loss, an' th' stage company'll feel
 better, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shoo! An' suppose I did shoot him, I done a good job, didn't I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu did the worst job yu could do, yu highway robber," softly said
 Hopalong, at the same time moving nearer. "Harris knew yu stopped th'
 stage last month, an' that's why yu've been dodgin' him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore a liar!" shouted Thirsty, reaching for his gun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The movement was fatal, for before he could draw, the Colt in Hopalong's
 holster leaped out and flashed from its owner's hip and Thirsty fell
 sideways, face down in the dust of the street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong started toward the fallen man, but as he did so a shot rang out
 from behind the store and he pitched forward, stumbled and rolled behind
 the bowlder. As he stumbled his left hand streaked to his hip, and when he
 fell he had a gun in each hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he disappeared from sight Goodeye and Bill Jones stepped from behind
 the store and started to run away. Not able to resist the temptation to
 look again, they stopped and turned and Bill laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Easy as sin," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Run, yu fool?Red an' Buck'll be here. Want to git plugged?" shouted
 Goodeye angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They turned and started for a group of ponies twenty yards away, and as
 they leaped into the saddles two shots were fired from the street. As the
 reports died away Buck and Red turned the corner of the store, Colts in
 hand, and, checking their rush as they saw the saddles emptied, they
 turned toward the street and saw Hopalong, with blood oozing from an
 abrasion on his cheek, sitting up cross-legged, with each hand holding a
 gun, from which came thin wisps of smoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' son-of-a-gun!" cried Buck, proud and delighted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' son-of-a-gun!" echoed Red, grinning.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII. Hopalong Keeps His Word
 </h2>
 <p>
 The waters of the Rio Grande slid placidly toward the Gulf, the hot sun
 branding the sleepy waters with streaks of molten fire. To the north arose
 from the gray sandy plain the Quitman Mountains, and beyond them lay Bass
 Ca on. From the latter emerged a solitary figure astride a broncho, and as
 he ascended the topmost rise he glanced below him at the placid stream and
 beyond it into Mexico. As he sat quietly in his saddle he smiled and
 laughed gently to himself. The trail he had just followed had been replete
 with trouble which had suited the state of his mind and he now felt
 humorous, having cleaned up a pressing debt with his six-shooter. Surely
 there ought to be a mild sort of excitement in the land he faced,
 something picturesque and out of the ordinary. This was to be the
 finishing touch to his trip, and he had left his two companions at
 Albuquerque in order that he might have to himself all that he could find.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not many miles to the south of him lay the town which had been the
 rendezvous of Tamale Jose, whose weakness had been a liking for other
 people's cattle. Well he remembered his first man hunt: the discovery of
 the theft, the trail and pursuit and?the ending. He was scarcely
 eighteen years of age when that event took place, and the wisdom he had
 absorbed then had stood him in good stead many times since. He had even
 now a touch of pride at the recollection how, when his older companions
 had failed to get Tamale Jose, he with his undeveloped strategy had gained
 that end. The fight would never be forgotten, as it was his first, and no
 sight of wounds would ever affect him as did those of Red Connors as he
 lay huddled up in the dark corner of that old adobe hut.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came to himself and laughed again as he thought of Carmencita, the
 first girl he had ever known?and the last. With a boy's impetuosity
 he had wooed her in a manner far different from that of the peons who sang
 beneath her window and talked to her mother. He had boldly scaled the wall
 and did his courting in her house, trusting to luck and to his own ability
 to avoid being seen. No hidden meaning lay in his words; he spoke from his
 heart and with no concealment. And he remembered the treachery that had
 forced him, fighting, to the camp of his outfit; and when he had returned
 with his friends she had disappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this day he hated that mud-walled convent and those sisters who so
 easily forgot how to talk. The fragrance of the old days wrapped
 themselves around him, and although he had ceased to pine for his
 black-eyed Carmencita-well, it would be nice if he chanced to see her
 again. Spurring his mount into an easy canter he swept down to and across
 the river, fording it where he had crossed it when pursuing Tamale Jose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The town lay indolent under the Mexican night, and the strumming of
 guitars and the tinkle of spurs and tiny bells softly echoed from several
 houses. The convent of St. Maria lay indistinct in its heavy shadows and
 the little church farther up the dusty street showed dim lights in its
 stained windows. Off to the north became audible the rhythmic beat of a
 horse and soon a cowboy swept past the convent with a mocking bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He clattered across the stone-paved plaza and threw his mount back on its
 haunches as he stopped before a house. Glancing around and determining to
 find out a few facts as soon as possible, he rode up to the low door and
 pounded upon it with the butt of his Colt. After waiting for possibly half
 a minute and receiving no response he hammered a tune upon it with two
 Colts and had the satisfaction of seeing half a score of heads protrude
 from the windows in the nearby houses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I could scare up another gun I might get th' whole blamed town up," he
 grumbled whimsically, and fell on the door with another tune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is it?" came from within. The voice was distinctly feminine and
 Hopalong winked to himself in congratulation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me," he replied, twirling his fingers from his nose at the curious,
 forgetting that the darkness hid his actions from sight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know; but who is 'me'?" Came from the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't I a fool!" he complained to himself, and raising his voice he
 replied coaxingly, "Open th' door a bit an' see. Are yu Carmencita?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O-o-o! but you must tell me who it is first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Cassidy," he replied, flushing at the 'mister,' "an' I wants to see
 Carmencita."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Carmencita who?" teasingly came from behind the door. Hopalong scratched
 his head. "Gee, yu've roped me?I suppose she has got another handle.
 Oh, yu know?she used to live here about seven years back. She had
 great big black eyes, pretty cheeks an' a mouth that 'ud stampede anybody.
 Don't yu know now? She was about so high," holding out his hands in the
 darkness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door opened a trifle on a chain and Hopalong peered eagerly forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, it is you, the brave Americano! You must go away quick or you will
 meet with harm. Manuel is awfully jealous and he will kill you! Go at
 once, please!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong pulled at the half-hearted down upon his lip and laughed softly.
 Then he slid the guns back in their holsters and felt for his sombrero.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manuel wants to see me first, Star Eyes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! no!" she replied, stamping upon the floor vehemently. "You must go
 now?at once!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd shore look nice hittin' th' trail because Manuel Somebody wants to
 get hurt, wouldn't I? Don't yu remember how I used to shinny up this here
 wall an' skin th' cat gettin' through that hole up there what yu said was
 a window? Ah, come on an' open th' door?I'd shore like to see yu
 again!" pleaded the irrepressible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! no! Go away. Oh, won't you please go away!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong sighed audibly and turned his horse. As he did so he heard the
 door open and a sigh reached his ears. He wheeled like a flash and found
 the door closed again on its chain. A laugh of delight came from behind
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come out, please!?just for a minute," he begged, wishing that he
 was brave enough to smash the door to splinters and grab her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I do, will you go away?" Asked the girl. "Oh, what will Manuel say if
 he comes? And all those people, they'll tell him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu!" shouted Hopalong, brandishing his Colts at the protruding
 heads. "Git scarce! I'll shore plug th' last one in!" Then he laughed at
 the sudden vanishing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door slowly opened and Carmencita, fat and drowsy, wobbled out to him.
 Hopalong's feelings were interfering with his breathing as he surveyed
 her. "Oh, yu shore are mistaken, Mrs. Carmencita. I wants to see yore
 daughter!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, you have forgotten the little Carmencita who used to look for you.
 Like all the men, you have forgotten," she cooed reproachfully. Then her
 fear predominated again and she cried, "Oh, if my husband should see me
 now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong mastered his astonishment and bowed. He had a desire to ride
 madly into the Rio Grande and collect his senses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu are right?this is too dangerous?I'll amble on some," he
 replied hastily. Under his breath he prayed that the outfit would never
 learn of this. He turned his horse and rode slowly up the street as the
 door closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rounding the corner he heard a soft footfall, and swerving in his saddle
 he turned and struck with all his might in the face of a man who leaped at
 him, at the same time grasping the uplifted wrist with his other hand. A
 curse and the tinkle of thin steel on the pavement accompanied the fall of
 his opponent. Bending down from his saddle he picked up the weapon and the
 next minute the enraged assassin was staring into the unwavering and, to
 him, growing muzzle of a Colt's .45.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu shore had a bum teacher. Don't yu know better'n to push it in? An' me
 a cowpuncher, too! I'm most grieved at yore conduct?it shows you
 don't appreciate cow-wrastlers. This is safer," he remarked, throwing the
 stiletto through the air and into a door, where it rang out angrily and
 quivered. "I don't know as I wants to ventilate yu; we mostly poisons
 coyotes up my way," he added. Then a thought struck him. "Yu must be that
 dear Manuel I've been hearin' so much about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A snarl was the only reply and Hopalong grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu shore ain't got no call to go loco that way, none whatever. I don't
 want yore Carmencita. I only called to say hulloo," responded Hopalong,
 his sympathies being aroused for the wounded man before him from his vivid
 recollection of the woman who had opened the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah!" snarled Manuel. "You wants to poison my little bird. You with your
 fair hair and your cursed swagger!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The six-shooter tentatively expanded and stopped six inches from the
 Mexican's nose. "Yu wants to ride easy, hombre. I ain't no angel, but I
 don't poison no woman; an' don't yu amble off with th' idea in yore head
 that she wants to be poisoned. Why, she near stuck a knife in me!" he
 lied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Mexican's face brightened somewhat, but it would take more than that
 to wipe out the insult of the blow. The horse became restless, and when
 Hopalong had effectively quieted it he spoke again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu ever hear of Tamale Jose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm th' fellow that stopped him in th' 'dobe hut by th' arroyo. I'm
 tellin' yu this so yu won't do nothin' rash an' leave Carmencita a widow.
 Sabe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hate on the Mexican's face redoubled and he took a short step forward,
 but stopped when the muzzle of the Colt kissed his nose. He was the
 brother of Tamale Jose. As he backed away from the cool touch of the
 weapon he thought out swiftly his revenge. Some of his brother's old
 companions were at that moment drinking mescal in a saloon down the
 street, and they would be glad to see this Americano die. He glanced past
 his house at the saloon and Hopalong misconstrued his thoughts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore, go home. I'll just circulate around some for exercise. No hard
 feelings, only yu better throw it next time," he said as he backed away
 and rode off. Manuel went down the street and then ran into the saloon,
 where he caused an uproar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong rode to the end of the plaza and tried to sing, but it was a
 dismal failure. Then he felt thirsty and wondered why he hadn't thought of
 it before. Turning his horse and seeing the saloon he rode up to it and
 in, lying flat on the animal's neck to avoid being swept off by the door
 frame. His entrance scared white some half a dozen loungers, who
 immediately sprang up in a decidedly hostile manner. Hopalong's Colts
 peeped over the ears of his horse and he backed into a corner near the
 bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One, two, three?now, altogether, breathe! Yu acts like yu never saw
 a real puncher afore. All th' same," he remarked, nodding at several of
 the crowd, "I've seen yu afore. Yu are th' gents with th' hot-foot
 get-a-way that vamoosed when we got Tamale."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Curses were flung at him and only the humorous mood he was in saved
 trouble. One, bolder than the rest, spoke up: "The senor will not see any
 'hot-foot get-a-way,' as he calls it, now! The senor was not wise to go so
 far away from his friends!"'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong looked at the speaker and a quizzical grin slowly spread over his
 face. "They'll shore feel glad when I tells them yu was askin' for 'em.
 But didn't yu see too much of 'em once, or was yu poundin' leather in the
 other direction? Yu don't want to worry none about me?an' if yu
 don't get yore hands closter to yore neck they'll be heck to pay! There,
 that's more like home," he remarked, nodding assurance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Reaching over he grasped a bottle and poured out a drink, his Colt
 slipping from his hand and dangling from his wrist by a thong. As the
 weapon started to fall several of the audience involuntarily moved as if
 to pick it up. Hopalong noticed this and paused with the glass half way to
 his lips. "Don't bother yoreselves none; I can git it again," he said,
 tossing off the liquor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wow! Holy smoke!" he yelled. "This ain't drink! Sufferin' coyotes, nobody
 can accuse yu of sellin' liquor! Did yu make this all by yoreself?" He
 asked incredulously of the proprietor, who didn't know whether to run or
 to pray. Then he noticed that the crowd was spreading out and his Colts
 again became the center of interest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu with th' lovely face, sit down!" he ordered as the person addressed
 was gliding toward the door. "I ain't a-goin' to let yu pot me from th'
 street. Th' first man who tries to get scarce will stop somethin' hot. An'
 yu all better sit down," he suggested, sweeping them with his guns. One
 man, more obdurate than the rest, was slow in complying and Hopalong sent
 a bullet through the top of his high sombrero, which had a most gratifying
 effect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll regret this!" hissed a man in the rear, and a murmur of assent
 arose. Some one stirred slightly in searching for a weapon and immediately
 a blazing Colt froze him into a statue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu shore looks funny; eeny, meeny, miny, mo," counted off the daring
 horseman; "move a bit an' off yu go," he finished. Then his face broke out
 in another grin as he thought of more enjoyment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That there gent on th' left," he said, pointing out with a gun the man he
 meant. "Yu sing us a song. Sing a nice little song."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the object of his remarks remained mute he let his thumb ostentatiously
 slide back with the hammer of the gun under it. "Sing! Quick!" The man
 sang.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Hopalong leaned forward to say something a stiletto flashed past his
 neck and crashed into the bottle beside him. The echo of the crash was
 merged into a report as Hopalong fired from his waist. Then he backed out
 into the Street and, wheeling, galloped across the plaza and again faced
 the saloon. A flash split the darkness and a bullet hummed over his head
 and thudded into an adobe wall at his back. Another shot and he replied,
 aiming at the flash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From down the Street came the sound of a window opening and he promptly
 caused it to close again. Several more windows opened and hastily closed,
 and he rode slowly toward the far end of the plaza. As he faced the saloon
 once more he heard a command to throw up his hands and saw the glint of a
 gun, held by a man who wore the insignia of sheriff. Hopalong complied,
 but as his hands went up two spurts of fire shot forth and the sheriff
 dropped his weapon, reeled and sat down. Hopalong rode over to him and
 swinging down, picked up the gun and looked the officer over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shoo, yu'll be all right soon?yore only plugged in th' arms," he
 remarked as he glanced up the street. Shadowy forms were gliding from
 cover to cover and he immediately caused consternation among them by his
 accuracy. "Ain't it sad?" He complained to the wounded man. "I never
 starts out but what somebody makes me shoot 'em. Came down here to see a
 girl an' find she's married. Then when I moves on peaceable?like her
 husband makes me hit him. Then I wants a drink an' he goes an' fans a
 knife at me, an' me just teachin' him how! Then yu has to come along an'
 make more trouble".
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now look at them fools over there," he said, pointing at a dark shadow
 some fifty paces off. "They're pattin' their backs because I don't see
 'em, an' if I hurts them they'll git mad. Guess I'll make 'em dust along,"
 he added, shooting into the spot. A howl went up and two men ran away at
 top speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff nodded his sympathy and spoke. "I reckons you had better give
 up. You can't get away. Every house, every corner and shadow holds a man.
 You are a brave man, but, as you say, unfortunate. Better help me up and
 come with me?they'll tear you to pieces."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore I'll help yu up?I ain't got no grudge against nobody. But my
 friends know where I am an' they'll come down here an' raise a ruction if
 I don't show up. So, if it's all th' same to you, I'll be ambling right
 along," he said as he helped the sheriff to his feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you any objections to telling me your name?" Asked the sheriff as he
 looked himself over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None whatever," answered Hopalong heartily. "I'm Hopalong Cassidy of th'
 Bar 20, Texas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't surprise me?I've heard of you," replied the sheriff
 wearily. "You are the man who killed Tamale Jose, whom I hunted for
 unceasingly. I found him when you had left and I got the reward. Come
 again some time and I'll divide with you; two hundred and fifty dollars,"
 he added craftily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shore will, but I don't want no money," replied Hopalong as he turned
 away. "Adios, senor," he called back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Adios," replied the sheriff as he kicked a nearby door for assistance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cow-pony tied itself up in knots as it pounded down the street toward
 the trail, and although he was fired on he swung into the dusty trail with
 a song on his lips. Several hours later he stood dripping wet on the
 American side of the Rio Grande and shouted advice to a score of Mexican
 cavalrymen on the opposite bank. Then he slowly picked his way toward El
 Paso for a game at Faro Dan's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff sat in his easy chair one night some three weeks later,
 gravely engaged in rolling a cigarette. His arms were practically well,
 the wounds being in the fleshy parts. He was a philosopher and was
 disposed to take things easy, which accounted for his being in his
 official position for fifteen years. A gentleman at the core, he was well
 educated and had visited a goodly portion of the world. A book of Horace
 lay open on his knees and on the table at his side lay a shining new
 revolver, Hopalong having carried off his former weapon. He read aloud
 several lines and in reaching for a light for his cigarette noticed the
 new six-shooter. His mind leaped from Horace to Hopalong, and he smiled
 grimly at the latter's promise to call.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">Glancing up, his eyes fell on a poster which conveyed the information in
Spanish and in English that there was offered

 +???????????????????+
 | | FIVE HUNDRED PESOS | |

 REWARD

 For Hopalong Cassidy, of the Ranch

 | | Known as the Bar-20, Texas, U. S. A. | |

 +???????????????????+
</pre>
 <p>
 and which gave a good description of that gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sighing for the five hundred, he again took up his book and was lost in
 its pages when he heard a knock, rather low and timid. Wearily laying
 aside his reading, he strode to the door, expecting to hear a lengthy
 complaint from one of his townsmen. As he threw the door wide open the
 light streamed out and lighted up a revolver and behind it the beaming
 face of a cowboy, who grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be damned!" ejaculated the sheriff, starting back in
 amazement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't say that, sheriff; you've got lots of time to reform," replied a
 humorous voice. "How's th' wings?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Almost well: you were considerate," responded the sheriff. "Let's go in?somebody
 might see me out here an' get into trouble," suggested the visitor,
 placing his foot on the sill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly?pardon my discourtesy," said the sheriff. "You see, I
 wasn't expecting you to-night," he explained, thinking of the elaborate
 preparations that he would have gone to if he had thought the
 irrepressible would call.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I was down this way, an' seeing as how I had promised to drop in I
 just natchurally dropped," replied Hopalong as he took the chair proffered
 by his host.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After talking awhile on everything and nothing the sheriff coughed and
 looked uneasily at his guest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Cassidy, I am sorry you called, for I like men of your energy and
 courage and I very much dislike to arrest you," remarked the sheriff. "Of
 course you understand that you are under arrest," he added with anxiety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who, me?" Asked Hopalong with a rising inflection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Most assuredly," breathed the sheriff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, this is the first time I ever heard anything about it," replied the
 astonished cow-puncher. "I'm an American?don't that make any
 difference?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not in this case, I'm afraid. You see, it's for manslaughter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, don't that beat th' devil, now?" Said Hopalong. He felt sorry that
 a citizen of the glorious United States should be prey for troublesome
 sheriffs, but he was sure that his duty to Texas called upon him never to
 submit to arrest at the hands of a Mexican. Remembering the Alamo, and
 still behind his Colt, he reached over and took up the shining weapon from
 the table and snapped it open on his knee. After placing the cartridges in
 his pocket he tossed the gun over on the bed and, reaching inside his
 shirt, drew out another and threw it after the first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's yore gun; I forgot to leave it," he said, apologetically. "Anyhow
 yu needs two," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he glanced around the room, noticed the poster and walked over and
 read it. A full swift sweep of his gloved hand tore it from its fastenings
 and crammed it under his belt. The glimmer of anger in his eyes gave way
 as he realized that his head was worth a definite price, and he smiled at
 what the boys would say when he showed it to them. Planting his feet far
 apart and placing his arms akimbo he faced his host in grim defiance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got any more of these?" He inquired, placing his hand on the poster under
 his belt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Several," replied the sheriff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trot 'em out," ordered Hopalong shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff sighed, stretched and went over to a shelf, from which he took
 a bundle of the articles in question. Turning slowly he looked at the
 puncher and handed them to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckons they's all over this here town," remarked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are, and you may never see Texas again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So? Well, yu tell yore most particular friends that the job is worth five
 thousand, and that it will take so many to do it that when th' mazuma is
 divided up it won't buy a meal. There's only one man in this country
 tonight that can earn that money, an' that's me," said the puncher. "An' I
 don't need it," he added, smiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you are my prisoner?you are under arrest," enlightened the
 sheriff, rolling another cigarette. The sheriff spoke as if asking a
 question. Never before had five hundred dollars been so close at hand and
 yet so unobtainable. It was like having a check-book but no bank account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm shore sorry to treat yu mean," remarked Hopalong, "but I was paid a
 month in advance an' I'll have to go back an' earn it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can?if you say that you will return," replied the sheriff
 tentatively. The sheriff meant what he said and for the moment had
 forgotten that he was powerless and was not the one to make terms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong was amazed and for a time his ideas of Mexicans staggered under
 the blow. Then he smiled sympathetically as he realized that he faced a
 white man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never like to promise nothin'," he replied. "I might get plugged, or
 something might happen that wouldn't let me." Then his face lighted up as
 a thought came to him. "Say, I'll cut di' cards with yu to see if I comes
 back or not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff leaned back and gazed at the cool youngster before him. A
 smile of satisfaction, partly at the self-reliance of his guest and partly
 at the novelty of his situation, spread over his face. He reached for a
 pack of Mexican cards and laughed. "Man! You're a cool one?I'll do
 it. What do you call?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Red," answered Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff slowly raised his hand and revealed the ace of hearts.
 Hopalong leaned back and laughed, at the same time taking from his pocket
 the six extracted cartridges. Arising and going over to the bed he slipped
 them in the chambers of the new gun and then placed the loaded weapon at
 the sheriff's elbow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I reckon I'll amble, sheriff," he said as he opened the door. "If
 yu ever sifts up my way drop in an' see me?th' boys'll give yu a
 good time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thanks; I will be glad to," replied the sheriff. "You'll take your
 pitcher to the well once too often some day, my friend. This courtesy,"
 glancing at the restored revolver, "might have cost you dearly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shoo! I did that once an' th' feller tried to use it," replied the cowboy
 as he backed through the door. "Some people are awfully careless," he
 added. "So long?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long," replied the sheriff, wondering what sort of a man he had been
 entertaining.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door closed softly and soon after a joyous whoop floated in from the
 Street. The sheriff toyed with the new gun and listened to the low caress
 of a distant guitar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, don't that beat all?" He ejaculated.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IX. The Advent of McAllister
 </h2>
 <p>
 The blazing sun shone pitilessly on an arid plain which was spotted with
 dust-gray clumps of mesquite and thorny chaparral. Basking in the burning
 sand and alkali lay several Gila monsters, which raised their heads and
 hissed with wide-open jaws as several faint, whip-like reports echoed
 flatly over the desolate plain, showing that even they had learned that
 danger was associated with such sounds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Off to the north there became visible a cloud of dust and at intervals
 something swayed in it, something that rose and fell and then became
 hidden again. Out of that cloud came sharp, splitting sounds, which were
 faintly responded to by another and larger cloud in its rear. As it came
 nearer and finally swept past, the Gilas, to their terror, saw a madly
 pounding horse, and it carried a man. The latter turned in his saddle and
 raised a gun to his shoulder and the thunder that issued from it caused
 the creeping audience to throw up their tails in sudden panic and bury
 themselves out of sight in the sand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The horse was only a broncho, its sides covered with hideous yellow spots,
 and on its near flank was a peculiar scar, the brand. Foam flecked from
 its crimsoned jaws and found a resting place on its sides and on the hairy
 chaps of its rider. Sweat rolled and streamed from its heaving flanks and
 was greedily sucked up by the drought-cursed alkali. Close to the rider's
 knee a bloody furrow ran forward and one of the broncho's ears was torn
 and limp. The broncho was doing its best?it could run at that pace
 until it dropped dead. Every ounce of strength it possessed was put forth
 to bring those hind hoofs well in front of the forward ones and to send
 them pushing the sand behind in streaming clouds. The horse had done this
 same thing many times?when would its master learn sense?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man was typical in appearance with many of that broad land. Lithe,
 sinewy and bronzed by hard riding and hot suns, he sat in his Cheyenne
 saddle like a centaur, all his weight on the heavy, leather-guarded
 stirrups, his body rising in one magnificent straight line. A bleached
 moustache hid the thin lips, and a gray sombrero threw a heavy shadow
 across his eyes. Around his neck and over his open, blue flannel shirt lay
 loosely a knotted silk kerchief, and on his thighs a pair of open-flapped
 holsters swung uneasily with their ivory handled burdens. He turned
 abruptly, raised his gun to his shoulder and fired, then he laughed
 recklessly and patted his mount, which responded to the confident caress
 by lying flatter to the earth in a spurt of heart-breaking speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll show 'em who they're trailin'. This is th' second time I've started
 for Muddy Wells, an' I'm goin' to git there, too, for all th' Apaches out
 of Hades!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the south another cloud of dust rapidly approached and the rider
 scanned it closely, for it was directly in his path. As he watched it he
 saw something wave and it was a sombrero! Shortly afterward a real cowboy
 yell reached his ears. He grinned and slid another cartridge in the
 greasy, smoking barrel of the Sharp's and fired again at the cloud in his
 rear. Some few minutes later a whooping, bunched crowd of madly riding
 cowboys thundered past him and he was recognized.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hullo, Frenchy!" yelled the nearest one. "Comin' back?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on, McAllister!" shouted another; "we'll give 'em blazes!" In
 response the straining broncho suddenly stiffened, bunched and slid on its
 haunches, wheeled and retraced its course. The rear cloud suddenly
 scattered into many smaller ones and all swept off to the east. The
 rescuing band overtook them and, several hours later, when seated around a
 table in Tom Lee's saloon, Muddy Wells, a count was taken of them, which
 was pleasing in its facts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We was huntin' coyotes when we saw yu," said a smiling puncher who was
 known as Salvation Carroll chiefly because he wasn't.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep! They've been stalkin' Tom's chickens," supplied Waffles, the
 champion poker player of the outfit. Tom Lee's chickens could whip
 anything of their kind for miles around and were reverenced accordingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sho! Is that so?" Asked Frenchy with mild incredulity, such a state of
 affairs being deplorable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She shore is!" answered Tex Le Blanc, and then, as an afterthought, he
 added, "Where'd yu hit th' War-whoops?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Bout four hours back. This here's th' second time I've headed for this
 place?last time they chased me to Las Cruces."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That so?" Asked Bigfoot Baker, a giant. "Ain't they allus interferin',
 now? Anyhow, they're better'n coyotes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They was purty well heeled," suggested Tex, glancing at a bunch of
 repeating Winchesters of late model which lay stacked in a corner.
 "Charley here said he thought they was from th' way yore cayuse looked,
 didn't yu, Charley?" Charley nodded and filled his pipe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Pears like a feller can't amble around much nowadays without havin' to
 fight," grumbled Lefty Allen, who usually went out of his way hunting up
 trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're goin' to th' Hills as soon as our cookie turns up," volunteered
 Tenspot Davis, looking inquiringly at Frenchy. "Heard any more news?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. Same old story?lots of gold. Shucks, I've bit on so many of
 them rumors that they don't feaze me no more. One man who don't know
 nothin' about prospectin' goes an' stumbles over a fortune an' those who
 know it from A to Izzard goes 'round pullin' in their belts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We don't pull in no belts?we knows just where to look, don't we,
 Tenspot?" Remarked Tex, looking very wise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as we do," answered Tenspot, "if yu hasn't dreamed about it, we do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu wait; I wasn't dreamin', none whatever," assured Tex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I saw it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as, I saw it too onct," replied Frenchy with sarcasm. "Went and lugged
 fifty pound of it all th' way to th' assay office?took me two days!
 an' that there four-eyed cuss looks at it and snickers. Then he takes me
 by di' arm an' leads me to th' window. 'See that pile, my friend? That's
 all like yourn,' sez he. 'It's worth about one simoleon a ton at th'
 coast. They use it for ballast.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw! But this what I saw was gold!" exploded Tex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So was mine, for a while!" laughed Frenchy, nodding to the bartender for
 another round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we're tired of punchin' cows! Ride sixteen hours a day, year in an'
 year out, an' what do we get? Fifty a month an' no chance to spend it, an'
 grub that'd make a coyote sniffle! I'm for a vacation, an' if I goes
 broke, why, I'll punch again!" asserted Waffles, the foreman, thus
 revealing the real purpose of the trip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'd yore boss say?" Asked Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whoop! What didn't he say! Honest, I never thought he had it in him. It
 was fine. He cussed an hour frontways an' then trailed back on a dead
 gallop, with us a-laughin' fit to bust. Then he rustles for his gun an' we
 rustles for town," answered Waffles, laughing at his remembrance of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Frenchy was about to reply his sombrero was snatched from his head and
 disappeared. If he "got mad" he was to be regarded as not sufficiently
 well acquainted for banter and he was at once in hot water; if he took it
 good-naturedly he was one of the crowd in spirit; but in either case he
 didn't get his hat without begging or fighting for it. This was a
 recognized custom among the O-Bar-O outfit and was not intended as an
 insult.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy grabbed at the empty air and arose. Punching Lefty playfully in
 the ribs he passed his hands behind that person's back. Not finding the
 lost head-gear he laughed and, tripping Lefty up, fell with him and,
 reaching up on the table for his glass, poured the contents down Lefty's
 back and arose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu son-of-a-gun!" indignantly wailed that unfortunate. "Gee, it feels
 funny," he added, grinning as he pulled the wet shirt away from his spine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've got to be amblin'," said Frenchy, totally ignoring the loss of
 his hat. "Goin' down to Buckskin," he offered, and then asked, "When's
 yore cook comin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Day after to-morrow, if he don't get loaded," replied Tex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A one-eyed Mexican?Quiensabe Antonio."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I used to know him. He's a heck of a cook. Dished up th' grub one season
 when I was punchin' for th' Tin-Cup up in Montana," replied Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he kin cook now, all right." replied Waffles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's about all he can cook. Useter wash his knives in th' coffee pot
 an' blow on di' tins. I chased him a mile one night for leavin' sand in
 th' skillet. Yu can have him?I don't envy yu none whatever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He don't sand no skillet when little Tenspot's around," assured that
 person, slapping his holster. "Does he, Lefty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If he does, yu oughter be lynched," consoled Lefty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, so long," remarked Frenchy, riding off to a small store, where he
 bought a cheap sombrero.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy was a jack-of-all-trades, having been cow-puncher, prospector,
 proprietor of a "hotel" in Albuquerque, foreman of a ranch, sheriff, and
 at one time had played angel to a venturesome but poor show troupe. Beside
 his versatility he was well known as the man who took the stage through
 the Sioux country when no one else volunteered. He could shoot with the
 best, but his one pride was the brand of poker he handed out. Furthermore,
 he had never been known to take an unjust advantage over any man and, on
 the contrary, had frequently voluntarily handicapped himself to make the
 event more interesting. But he must not be classed as being hampered with
 self-restraint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His reasons for making this trip were two-fold: he wished to see Buck
 Peters, the foreman of the Bar-20 outfit, as he and Buck had punched cows
 together twenty years before and were firm friends; the other was that he
 wished to get square with Hopalong Cassidy, who had decisively cleaned him
 out the year before at poker. Hopalong played either in great good luck or
 the contrary, while Frenchy played an even, consistent game and usually
 left off richer than when he began, and this decisive defeat bothered him
 more than he would admit, even to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The round-up season was at hand and the Bar-20 was short of ropers, the
 rumors of fresh gold discoveries in the Black Hills having drawn all the
 more restless men north. The outfit also had a slight touch of the gold
 fever, and only their peculiar loyalty to the ranch and the assurance of
 the foreman that when the work was over he would accompany them, kept them
 from joining the rush of those who desired sudden and much wealth as the
 necessary preliminary of painting some cow town in all the "bang up" style
 such an event would call for. Therefore they had been given orders to
 secure the required assistance, and they intended to do so, and were
 prepared to kidnap, if necessary, for the glamour of wealth and the
 hilarity of the vacation made the hours falter in their speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Frenchy leaned back in his chair in Cowan's saloon, Buckskin, early the
 next morning, planning to get revenge on Hopalong and then to recover his
 sombrero, he heard a medley of yells and whoops and soon the door flew
 open before the strenuous and concentrated entry of a mass of twisting and
 kicking arms and legs, which magically found their respective owners and
 reverted to the established order of things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the alkali dust had thinned he saw seven cow-punchers sitting on the
 prostrate form of another, who was earnestly engaged in trying to push
 Johnny Nelson's head out in the street with one foot as he voiced his
 lucid opinion of things in general and the seven in particular. After Red
 Connors had been stabbed in the back several times by the victim's
 energetic elbow he ran out of the room and presently returned with a
 pleased expression and a sombrero full of water, his finger plugging an
 old bullet hole in the crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is he any better, Buck?" Anxiously inquired the man with the reservoir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About a dollar's worth," replied the foreman. "Jest put a little right
 here," he drawled as he pulled back the collar of the unfortunate's shirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ow! wow! WOW!" wailed the recipient, heaving and straining. The unengaged
 leg was suddenly wrested loose, and as it shot up and out Billy Williams,
 with his pessimism aroused to a blue-ribbon pitch, sat down forcibly in an
 adjacent part of the room, from where he lectured between gasps on the
 follies of mankind and the attributes of army mules.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red tiptoed around the squirming bunch, looking for an opening, his
 pleased expression now having added a grin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seems to be gittin' violent-like," he soliloquized, as he aimed a stream
 at Hopalong's ear, which showed for a second as Pete Wilson strove for a
 half-nelson, and he managed to include Johnny and Pete in his effort.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several minutes later, when the storm had subsided, the woeful crowd
 enthusiastically urged Hopalong to the bar, where he "bought."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of all th' ornery outfits I ever saw?" began the man at the table,
 grinning from ear to ear at the spectacle he had just witnessed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, hullo, Frenchy! Glad to see yu, yu old son-of-a-gun! What's th' news
 from th' Hills?" Shouted Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rather locoed, an' there's a locoed gang that's headin' that way. Goin'
 up?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore, after round-up. Seen any punchers trailin' around loose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as," drawled Frenchy, delving into the possibilities suddenly opened
 to him and determining to utilize to the fullest extent the opportunity
 that had come to him unsought. "There's nine over to Muddy Wells that yu
 might git if yu wants them bad enough. They've got a sombrero of mine," he
 added deprecatingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nine! Twisted Jerusalem, Buck! Nine whole cow-punchers a-pinin' for
 work," he shouted, but then added thoughtfully, "Mebby they's engaged," it
 being one of the courtesies of the land not to take another man's help.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. They've stampeded for th' Hills an' left their boss all alone,"
 replied Frenchy, well knowing that such desertion would not, in the minds
 of the Bar-20 men, add any merits to the case of the distant outfit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' sons-of-guns," said Hopalong, "let's go an' get 'em," he suggested,
 turning to Buck, who nodded a smiling assent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, what's the hurry?" Asked Frenchy, seeing his projected game slipping
 away into the uncertain future and happy in the thought that he would be
 avenged on the O-Bar-O outfit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'll be there till to-morrow noon?they's waitin' for their
 cookie, who's goin' with them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A cook! A cook! Oh, joy, a cook!" exulted Johnny, not for one instant
 doubting Buck's ability to capture the whole outfit and seeing a whirl of
 excitement in the effort.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anybody we knows?" Inquired Skinny Thompson.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore. Tenspot Davis, Waffles, Salvation Carroll, Bigfoot Baker, Charley
 Lane, Lefty Allen, Kid Morris, Curley Tate an' Tex Le Blanc," responded
 Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Umm-m. Might as well rope a blizzard," grumbled Billy. "Might as well try
 to git th' Seventh Cavalry. We'll have a pious time corralling that bunch.
 Them's th' fellows that hit that bunch of inquirin' Crow braves that time
 up in th' Bad Lands an' then said by-bye to th' Ninth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, shut up! They's only two that's very much, an' Buck an' Hopalong can
 sing 'em to sleep," interposed Johnny, afraid that the expedition would
 fall through.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How about Curley and Tex?" Pugnaciously asked Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huh, jest because they buffaloed yu over to Las Vegas yu needn't think
 they's dangerous. Salvation an' Tenspot are only ones who can shoot,"
 stoutly maintained Johnny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here yu, get mum," ordered Buck to the pair. "When this outfit goes after
 anything it generally gets it. All in favor of kidnappin' that outfit
 signify di' same by kickin' Billy," whereupon Bill swore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do yu want yore hat?" Asked Buck, turning to Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shore do," answered that individual.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If yu helps us at th' round-up we'll get it for yu. Fifty a month an'
 grub," offered the foreman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O.K." replied Frenchy, anxious to even matters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck looked at his watch. "Seven o'clock?we ought to get there by
 five if we relays at th' Barred-Horseshoe. Come on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are we goin' to git them?" Asked Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu leave that to me, son. Hopalong an' Frenchy'll tend to that part of
 it," replied Buck, making for his horse and swinging into the saddle, an
 example which was followed by the others, including Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they swung off Buck noticed the condition of Frenchy's mount and
 halted. "Yu take that cayuse back an' get Cowan's," he ordered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That cayuse is good for Cheyenne?she eats work, an' besides I wants
 my own," laughed Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu must had a reg'lar picnic from th' looks of that crease," volunteered
 Hopalong, whose curiosity was mastering him. "Shoo! I had a little
 argument with some feather dusters?th' O-Bar-O crowd cleaned them
 up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That so?" Asked Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep! They sorter got into th' habit of chasin' me to Las Cruces an'
 forgot to stop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How many'd yu get?" Asked Lanky Smith.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twelve. Two got away. I got two before th' crowd showed up?that
 makes fo'teen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now th' cavalry'll be huntin' yu," croaked Billy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hunt nothin'! They was in war-paint-think I was a target??Think I
 was goin' to call off their shots for 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They relayed at the Barred-Horseshoe and went on their way at the same
 pace. Shortly after leaving the last-named ranch Buck turned to Frenchy
 and asked, "Any of that outfit think they can play poker?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore. Waffles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does th' reverend Mr. Waffles think so very hard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He shore does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do th' rest of them mavericks think so too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd bet their shirts on him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this juncture all were startled by a sudden eruption from Billy. "Haw!
 Haw! Haw!" he roared as the drift of Buck's intentions struck him. "Haw!
 Haw! Haw!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, yu long-winded coyote," yelled Red, banging him over the head with
 his quirt, "If yu don't 'Haw! Haw!' away from my ear I'll make it a Wow!
 Wow! What d'yu mean? Think I am a echo cliff? Yu slabsided doodle-bug,
 yu!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "G'way, yu crimson topknot, think my head's a hunk of quartz? Fer a
 plugged peso I'd strew yu all over th' scenery!" shouted Billy, feigning
 anger and rubbing his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There ain't no scenery around here," interposed Lanky. "This here
 be-utiful prospect is a sublime conception of th' devil."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Easy, boy! Them highfalutin' words'il give yu a cramp some day. Yu talk
 like a newly-made sergeant," remarked Skinny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He learned them words from the sky-pilot over at El Paso," volunteered
 Hopalong, winking at Red. "He used to amble down th' aisle afore the
 lights was lit so's he could get a front seat. That was all hunky for a
 while, but every time he'd go out to irrigate, that female organ-wrastler
 would seem to call th' music off for his special benefit. So in a month
 he'd sneak in an' freeze to a chair by th' door, an' after a while he'd
 shy like blazes every time he got within eye range of th' church."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore. But do yu know what made him get religion all of a sudden? He used
 to hang around on di' outside after th' joint let out an' trail along
 behind di' music-slinger, lookin' like he didn't know what to do with his
 hands. Then when he got woozy one time she up an' told him that she had
 got a nice long letter from her hubby. Then Mr. Lanky hit th' trail for
 Santa Fe so hard that there wasn't hardly none of it left. I didn't see
 him for a whole month," supplied Red innocently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore funny, ain't yu?" sarcastically grunted Lanky. "Why, I can
 tell things on yu that'd make yu stand treat for a year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn't sneak off to Santa Fe an' cheat yu out of them. Yu ought to be
 ashamed of yoreself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah!" snorted the aggrieved little man. "I had business over to Santa
 Fe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," endorsed Hopalong. "We've all had business over to Santa Fe. Why,
 about eight years ago I had business?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Choke up," interposed Red. "About eight years ago yu was washin' pans for
 cookie, an' askin' me for cartridges. Buck used to larrup yu about four
 times a day eight years ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To their roars of laughter Hopalong dropped to the rear, where, red-faced
 and quiet, he bent his thoughts on how to get square.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll have a pleasant time corralling that gang," began Billy for the
 third time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For heaven's sake get off that trail!" replied Lanky. "We aint goin' to
 hold 'em up. De-plomacy's th' game."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy looked dubious and said nothing. If he hadn't proven that he was as
 nervy as any man in the outfit they might have taken more stock in his
 grumbling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the latest from Abilene way?" Asked Buck of Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothin' much 'cept th' barb-wire ruction," replied the recruit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that?" Asked Red, glancing apprehensively back at Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, th' settlers put up barb-wire fence so's the cattle wouldn't get on
 their farms. That would a been all right, for there wasn't much of it. But
 some Britishers who own a couple of big ranches out there got smart all of
 a sudden an' strung wire all along their lines. Punchers crossin' th'
 country would run plumb into a fence an' would have to ride a day an' a
 half, mebbe, afore they found th' corner. Well, naturally, when a man has
 been used to ridin' where he blame pleases an' as straight as he pleases
 he ain't goin' to chase along a five-foot fence to Trisco when he wants to
 get to Waco. So th' punchers got to totin' wire-snips, an' when they runs
 up agin a fence they cuts down half a mile or so. Sometimes they'd tie
 their ropes to a strand an' pull off a couple of miles an' then go back
 after th' rest. Th' ranch bosses sent out men to watch th' fences an' told
 'em to shoot any festive puncher that monkeyed with th' hardware. Well, yu
 know what happens when a puncher gets shot at."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When fences grow in Texas there'll be th' devil to pay," said Buck. He
 hated to think that some day the freedom of the range would be annulled,
 for he knew that it would be the first blow against the cowboys'
 occupation. When a man's cattle couldn't spread out all over the land he
 wouldn't have to keep so many men. Farms would spring up and the sun of
 the free-and-easy cowboy would slowly set.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckons th' cutters are classed th' same as rustlers," remarked Red
 with a gleam of temper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By th' owners, but not by th' punchers; an' it's th' punchers that
 count," replied Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we'll give them a fight," interposed Hopalong, riding up. "When it
 gets so I can't go where I please I'll start on th' warpath. I won't buck
 the cavalry, but I'll keep it busy huntin' for me an' I'll have time to
 'tend to th' wire-fence men, too. Why, we'll be told we can't tote our
 guns!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're sayin' that now," replied Frenchy. "Up in Buffalo, Smith, who's
 now marshal, makes yu leave 'em with th' bartenders."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd like to see any two-laigged cuss get my guns If I didn't want him
 to!" began Hopalong, indignant at the idea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Easy, son," cautioned Buck. "Yu would do what th' rest did because yu are
 a square man. I'm about as hard-headed a puncher as ever straddled leather
 an' I've had to use my guns purty considerable, but I reckons if any
 decent marshal asked me to cache them in a decent way, why, I'd do it. An'
 let me brand somethin' on yore mind?I've heard of Smith of Buffalo,
 an' he's mighty nifty with his hands. He don't stand off an' tell yu to
 unload yore lead-ranch, but he ambles up close an' taps yu on yore shirt;
 if yu makes a gunplay he naturally knocks yu clean across th' room an'
 unloads yu afore yu gets yore senses back. He weighs about a hundred an'
 eighty an' he's shore got sand to burn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah! When I makes a gun play she plays! I'd look nice in Abilene or Paso
 or Albuquerque without my guns, wouldn't I? Just because I totes them in
 plain sight I've got to hand 'em over to some liquor-wrastler? I reckons
 not! Some hip-pocket skunk would plug me afore I could wink. I'd shore
 look nice loping around a keno layout without my guns, in th' same town
 with some cuss huntin' me, wouldn't I? A whole lot of good a marshal would
 a done Jimmy, an' didn't Harris get his from a cur in th' dark?" shouted
 Hopalong, angered by the prospect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're talkin' about Buffalo, where everybody has to hang up their guns,"
 replied Buck. "An' there's th' law?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To blazes with th' law!" whooped Hopalong in Red's ear as he unfastened
 the cinch of Red's saddle and at the same time stabbing that unfortunate's
 mount with his spurs, thereby causing a hasty separation of the two. When
 Red had picked himself up and things had quieted down again the subject
 was changed, and several hours later they rode into Muddy Wells, a town
 with a little more excuse for its existence than Buckskin. The wells were
 in an arid valley west of Guadaloupe Pass, and were not only muddy but
 more or less alkaline.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER. X. Peace Hath its Victories
 </h2>
 <p>
 As they neared the central group of buildings they heard a hilarious and
 assertive song which sprang from the door and windows of the main saloon.
 It was in jig time, rollicking and boisterous, but the words had evidently
 been improvised for the occasion, as they clashed immediately with those
 which sprang to the minds of the outfit, although they could not be
 clearly distinguished. As they approached nearer and finally dismounted,
 however, the words became recognizable and the visitors were at once
 placed in harmony with the air of jovial recklessness by the roaring of
 the verses and the stamping of the time.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> Oh we're red-hot cow-punchers playin' on our luck,
 An' there ain't a proposition that we won't buck:
 From sunrise to sunset we've ridden on the range,
 But now we're oft for a howlin' change.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">CHORUS

 Laugh a little, sing a little, all th' day;
 Play a little, drink a little?we can pay;
 Ride a little, dig a little an' rich we'll grow.
 Oh, we're that bunch from th' O-Bar-O!

 Oh, there was a little tenderfoot an' he had a little gun,
 An' th' gun an' him went a-trailin' up some fun.
 They ambles up to Santa Fe' to find a quiet game,
 An' now they're planted with some more of th' same!
</pre>
 <p>
 As Hopalong, followed by the others, pushed open the door and entered he
 took up the chorus with all the power of Texan lungs and even Billy joined
 in. The sight that met their eyes was typical of the men and the mood and
 the place. Leaning along the walls, lounging on the table and straddling
 chairs with their forearms crossed on the backs were nine cowboys, ranging
 from old twenty to young fifty in years, and all were shouting the song
 and keeping time with their hands and feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the center of the room was a large man dancing a fair buck-and-wing to
 the time so uproariously set by his companions. Hatless, neck-kerchief
 loose, holsters flapping, chaps rippling out and close, spurs clinking and
 perspiration streaming from his tanned face, danced Bigfoot Baker as
 though his life depended on speed and noise. Bottles shook and the air was
 fogged with smoke and dust. Suddenly, his belt slipping and letting his
 chaps fall around his ankles, he tripped and sat down heavily. Gasping for
 breath, he held out his hand and received a huge plug of tobacco, for
 Bigfoot had won a contest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shouts of greeting were hurled at the newcomers and many questions were
 fired at them regarding "th' latest from th' Hills." Waffles made a rush
 for Hopalong, but fell over Big-foot's feet and all three were piled up in
 a heap. All were beaming with good nature, for they were as so many school
 boys playing truant. Prosaic cow-punching was relegated to the rear and
 they looked eagerly forward to their several missions. Frenchy told of the
 barb-wire fence war and of the new regulations of "Smith of Buffalo"
 regarding cow-punchers' guns, and from the caustic remarks explosively
 given it was plain to be seen what a wire fence could expect, should one
 be met with, and there were many imaginary Smiths put hors de combat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kid Morris, after vainly trying to slip a blue-bottle fly inside of
 Hopalong's shirt, gave it up and slammed his hand on Hopalong's back
 instead, crying: "Well, I'll be doggoned if here ain't Hopalong! How's th'
 missus an' th' deacon an' all th' folks to hum? I hears yu an' Frenchy's
 reg'lar poker fiends!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, we plays onct in a while, but we don't want none of yore dust. Yu'll
 shore need it all afore th' Hills get through with yu," laughingly replied
 Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yore shore kind! But I was a sort of reckonin' that we needs some
 more. Perfesser P. D. Q. Waffles is our poker man an' he shore can clean
 out anything I ever saw. Mebbe yu fellers feel reckless-like an' would
 like to make a pool," he cried, addressing the outfit of the Bar-20, "an'
 back yore boss of th' full house agin ourn?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red turned slowly around and took a full minute in which to size the Kid
 up. Then he snorted and turned his back again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Kid stared at him in outraged dignity. "Well, what say!" he softly
 murmured. Then he leaped forward and walloped Red on the back. "Hey, yore
 royal highness!" he shouted. "Yu-yu-yu-oh, hang it-yu! Yu slab-sided,
 ring-boned, saddle-galled shade of a coyote, do yu think I'm only
 meanderin' in th' misty vales of-of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suggestions intruded from various sources. "Hades?" offered Hopalong.
 "Cheyenne?" Murmured Johnny. "Misty mistiness of misty?" tentatively
 supplied Waffles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red turned around again. "Better come up an' have somethin'," he
 sympathetically invited, wiping away an imaginary tear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' he's so young!" sobbed Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' so fair!" wailed Tex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' so ornery!" howled Lefty, throwing his arms around the discomfited
 youngster. Other arms went around him, and out of the sobbing mob could be
 heard earnest and heart-felt cussing, interspersed with imperative
 commands, which were gradually obeyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Kid straightened up his wearing apparel. "Come on, yu locoed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Angels?" Queried Charley Lane, interrupting him. "Sweet things?" breathed
 Hopalong in hopeful expectancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, blast it!" yelled the Kid as he ran out into the street to escape the
 persecution.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Kid, all right," remarked Waffles. "He'll go around an' lick some
 Mexican an' come back sweet as honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did somebody say poker?" Asked Bigfoot, digressing from the Kid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yu fellows don't want no poker. Of course yu don't. Poker's mighty
 uncertain," replied Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah!" exclaimed Tex Le Blanc, pushing forward. "I'll just bet yu to a
 standstill that Waffles an' Salvation'll round up all th' festive
 simoleons yu can get together! An' I'll throw in Frenchy's hat as an
 inducement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if yore shore set on it make her a pool," replied Red, "an' th'
 winners divide with their outfit. Here's a starter," he added, tossing a
 buckskin bag on the table. "Come on, pile 'em up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The crowd divided as the players seated themselves at the table, the
 O-Bar-O crowd grouping themselves behind their representatives; the Bar-20
 behind theirs. A deck of cards was brought and the game was on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red, true to his nature, leaned back in a corner, where, hands on hips, he
 awaited any hostile demonstration on the part of the O-Bar-O; then,
 suddenly remembering, he looked half ashamed of his warlike position and
 became a peaceful citizen again. Buck leaned with his broad back against
 the bar, talking over his shoulder to the bartender, but watching Tenspot
 Davis, who was assiduously engaged in juggling a handful of Mexican
 dollars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Up by the door Bigfoot Baker, elated at winning the buck-and-wing contest,
 was endeavoring to learn a new step, while his late rival was drowning his
 defeat at Buck's elbow. Lefty Allen was softly singing a Mexican love
 song, humming when the words would not come. At the table could be heard
 low-spoken card terms and good-natured banter, interspersed with the clink
 of gold and silver and the soft pat-pat of the onlookers' feet
 unconsciously keeping time to Lefty's song. Notwithstanding the grim
 assertiveness of belts full of .45's and the peeping handles of
 long-barreled Colts, set off with picturesque chaps, sombreros and
 tinkling spurs, the scene was one of peaceful content and good-fellowship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ugh!" grunted Johnny, walking over to Red and informing that person that
 he, Red, was a worm-eaten prune and that for half a wink he, Johnny, would
 prove it. Red grabbed him by the seat of his corduroys and the collar of
 his shirt and helped him outside, where they strolled about, taking pot
 shots at whatever their fancy suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down the street in a cloud of dust rumbled the Las Cruces-El Paso stage
 and the two punchers went up to meet it. Raw furrows showed in the
 woodwork, one mule was missing and the driver and guard wore fresh
 bandages. A tired tenderfoot leaped out with a sigh of relief and hunted
 for his baggage, which he found to be generously perforated. Swearing at
 the God-forsaken land where a man had to fight highwaymen and Indians
 inside of half a day he grumblingly lugged his valise toward a
 forbidding-looking shack which was called a hotel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The driver released his teams and then turned to Red. "Hullo, old hoss,
 how's th' gang?" he asked genially. "We've had a heck of a time this yere
 trip," he went on without waiting for Red to reply. "Five miles out of Las
 Cruces we stood off a son-of-a-gun that wanted th' dude's wealth. Then
 just this side of the San Andre foothills we runs into a bunch of young
 bucks who turned us off this yere way an' gave us a runnin' fight purty
 near all th' way. I'm a whole lot farther from Paso now than I was when I
 started, an seem as I lost a jack I'll be some time gittin' there. Yu
 don't happen to sabe a jack I can borrow, do yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know about no jack, but I'll rope yu a bronch," offered Red,
 winking at Johnny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll pull her myself before I'll put dynamite in di' traces," replied the
 driver. "Yu fellers might amble back a ways with me?them buddin'
 warriors'll be layin' for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We shore will," responded Johnny eagerly. "There's nine of us now an'
 there'll be nine more an' a cook to-morrow, mebby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gosh, yu grows some," replied the guard. "Eighteen'll be a plenty for
 them glory hunters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We won't be able to," contradicted Red, "for things are peculiar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the tenderfoot, who
 sported a new and cheap sombrero and also a belt and holster complete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you gentlemen join me?" He asked, turning to Red and nodding at the
 saloon. "I am very dry and much averse to drinking alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, shore," responded Red heartily, wishing to put the stranger at ease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The game was running about even as they entered and Lefty Allen was
 singing "The Insult," the rich tenor softening the harshness of the
 surroundings.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> I've swum th' Colorado where she's almost lost to view, I've braced
 th' Jaro layouts in Cheyenne;

 I've fought for muddy water with a howlin' bunch of Sioux, An'
 swallowed hot tamales, an' cayenne.

 I've rid a pitchin' broncho 'till th' sky was underneath, I've
 tackled every desert in th' land;

 I've sampled XXXX whiskey 'till I couldn't hardly see, An' dallied
 with th' quicksands of the Grande.

 I've argued with th' marshals of a half-a-dozen burgs, I've been
 dragged free an' fancy by a cow;

 I've had three years' campaignin' with th' fightin', bitin' Ninth,
 An' never lost my temper 'till right now.

 I've had the yaller fever an I've been shot full of holes, I've
 grabbed an army mule plumb by its tail;

 I've never been so snortin', really highfalutin' mad As when y'u up
 an' hands me ginger ale!
</pre>
 <p>
 Hopalong laughed joyously at a remark made by Waffles and the stranger
 glanced quickly at him. His merry, boyish face, underlined by a jaw
 showing great firmness and set with an expression of aggressive
 self-reliance, impressed the stranger and he remarked to Red, who lounged
 lazily near him, that he was surprised to see such a face on so young a
 man and he asked who the player was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, his name's Hopalong Cassidy," answered Red. "He's di' cuss that
 raised that ruction down in Mexico last spring. Rode his cayuse in a
 saloon and played with the loungers and had to shoot one before he got
 out. When he did get out he had to fight a whole bunch of Mexicans an'
 even potted their marshal, who had di' drop on him. Then he returned and
 visited the marshal about a month later, took his gun away from him an'
 then cut th' cards to see if he was a prisoner or not. He's a shore funny
 cuss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tenderfoot gasped his amazement. "Are you not fooling with me?" He
 asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell him yu came after that five hundred dollars reward and see,"
 answered Red goodnaturedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holy smoke!" shouted Waffles as Hopalong won his sixth consecutive pot.
 "Did yu ever see such luck?" Frenchy grinned and some time later raked in
 his third. Salvation then staked his last cent against Hopalong's flush
 and dropped out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tenspot flipped to Waffles the money he had been juggling and Lefty
 searched his clothes for wealth. Buck, still leaning against the bar,
 grinned and winked at Johnny, who was pouring hair-raising tales into the
 receptive ears of the stranger. Thereupon Johnny confided to his newly
 found acquaintance the facts about the game, nearly causing that person to
 explode with delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Waffles pushed back his chair, stood up and stretched. At the finish of a
 yawn he grinned at his late adversary. "I'm all in, yu old son-of-a-gun.
 Yu shore can play draw. I'm goin' to try yu again some time. I was beat
 fair an' square an' I ain't got no kick comin', none whatever," he
 remarked, as he shook hands with Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, we're that gang from th' O-Bar-O," hummed the Kid as he sauntered in.
 One cheek was slightly swollen and his clothes shed dust at every step.
 "Who wins?" he inquired, not having heard Waffles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They did, blast it!" exploded Bigfoot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the Kid's peculiarities was revealed in the unreasoning and hasty
 conclusions he arrived at. From no desire to imply unfairness, but rather
 because of his bitterness against failure of any kind and his loyalty to
 Waffles, came his next words:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby they skinned yu."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like a flash Waffles sprang before him, his hand held up, palm out. "He
 don't mean nothin'?he's only a ignorant kid!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck smiled and wrested the Colt from Johnny's ever-ready hand. "Here's
 another," he said. Red laughed softly and rolled Johnny on the floor. "Yu
 jackass," he whispered, "don't yu know better'n to make a gun-play when we
 needs them all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are we goin' to do?" Asked Tex, glancing at the bulging pockets of
 Hopalong's chaps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're goin' to punch cows again, that's what we're to do," answered
 Bigfoot dismally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' whose are we goin' to punch? We can't go back to the old man,"
 grumbled Tex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Salvation looked askance at Buck and then at the others. "Mebby," he
 began, "Mebby we kin git a job on th' Bar-20." Then turning to Buck again
 he bluntly asked, "Are yu short of punchers?"
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">"Well, I might use some," answered the foreman, hesitating. "But
 I ain't got only one cook, an'??"
</pre>
 <p>
 "We'll git yu th' cook all O.K.," interrupted Charley Lane vehemently.
 "Hi, yu cook!" he shouted, "amble in here an' git a rustle on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no reply, and after waiting for a minute he and Waffles went
 into the rear room, from which there immediately issued great chunks of
 profanity and noise. They returned looking pugnacious and disgusted, with
 a wildly fighting man who was more full of liquor than was the bottle
 which he belligerently waved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This here animated distillery what yu sees is our cook," said Waffles.
 "We eats his grub, nobody else. If he gits drunk that's our funeral; but
 he won't get drunk! If yu wants us to punch for yu say so an' we does; if
 yu don't, we don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," replied Buck thoughtfully, "mebby I can use yu." Then with a burst
 of recklessness he added, "Yes, if I lose my job! But yu might sober that
 Mexican up if yu let him fall in th' horse trough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the procession wended its way on its mission of wet charity, carrying
 the cook in any manner at all, Frenchy waved his long lost sombrero at
 Buck, who stood in the door, and shouted, "Yu old son-of-a-gun, I'm proud
 to know yu!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck smiled and snapped his watch shut "Time to amble," he said.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XI. Holding the Claim
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Oh, we're that gang from th' O-Bar-O," hummed Waffles, sinking the
 branding-iron in the flank of a calf. The scene was one of great activity
 and hilarity. Several fires were burning near the huge corral and in them
 half a dozen irons were getting hot. Three calves were being held down for
 the brand of the "Bar-20" and two more were being dragged up on their
 sides by the ropes of the cowboys, the proud cow-ponies showing off their
 accomplishments at the expense of the calves' feelings. In the corral the
 dust arose in steady clouds as calf after calf was "cut out" by the ropers
 and dragged out to get "tagged." Angry cows fought valiantly for their
 terrorized offspring, but always to no avail, for the hated rope of some
 perspiring and dust-grimed rider sent them crashing to earth. Over the
 plain were herds of cattle and groups of madly riding cowboys, and two
 cook wagons were stalled a short distance from the corral. The round-up of
 the Bar-20 was taking place, and each of the two outfits tried to outdo
 the other and each individual strove for a prize. The man who cut out and
 dragged to the fire the most calves in three days could leave for the
 Black Hills at the expiration of that time, the rest to follow as soon as
 they could.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">In this contest Hopalong Cassidy led his nearest rival, Red Connors,
both of whom were Bar-20 men, by twenty cut-outs, and there remained but
half an hour more in which to compete. As Red disappeared into the sea
of tossing horns Hopalong dashed out with a whoop.

 "Hi, yu trellis-built rack of bones, come along there! Whoop!" he
yelled, turning the prisoner over to the squad by the fire.
</pre>
 <p>
 "Chalk up this here insignificant wart of cross-eyed perversity: an' how
 many?" He called as he galloped back to the corral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One ninety-eight," announced Buck, blowing the sand from the tally sheet.
 "That's shore goin' some," he remarked to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the calf sprang up it was filled with terror, rage and pain, and
 charged at Billy from the rear as that pessimistic soul was leaning over
 and poking his finger at a somber horned-toad. "Wow!" he yelled as his
 feet took huge steps up in the air, each one strictly on its own course.
 "Woof!" he grunted in the hot sand as he arose on his hands and knees and
 spat alkali.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's s'matter?" He asked dazedly of Johnny Nelson. "Ain't it funny!" he
 yelled sarcastically as he beheld Johnny holding his sides with laughter.
 "Ain't it funny!" he repeated belligerently. "Of course that four-laigged,
 knock-kneed, wobblin' son-of-a-Piute had to cut me out. They wasn't nobody
 in sight but Billy! Why didn't yu say he was comin'? Think I can see four
 ways to once? Why didn't?" At this point Red cantered up with a
 calf, and by a quick maneuver, drew the taut rope against the rear of
 Billy's knees, causing that unfortunate to sit down heavily. As he arose
 choking with broken-winded profanity Red dragged the animal to the fire,
 and Billy forgot his grievances in the press of labor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How many, Buck?" Asked Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One-eighty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How does she stand?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore eighteen to th' bad," replied the foreman. "Th' son-of-a-gun!"
 marveled Red, riding off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another whoop interrupted them, and Billy quit watching out of the corner
 eye for pugnacious calves as he prepared for Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, Buck, this here cuss was with a Barred-Horseshoe cow," he announced
 as he turned it over to the branding man. Buck made a tally in a separate
 column and released the animal. "Hullo, Red! Workin'?" Asked Hopalong of
 his rival.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some, yu little cuss," answered Red with all the good nature in the
 world. Hopalong was his particular "side partner," and he could lose to
 him with the best of feelings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu looks so nice an' cool, an' clean, I didn't know," responded Hopalong,
 eyeing a streak of sweat and dust which ran from Red's eyes to his chin
 and then on down his neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What yu been doin'? Plowin' with yore nose?" Returned Red, smiling
 blandly at his friend's appearance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yah!" snorted Hopalong, wheeling toward the corral. "Come on, yu
 pie-eatin' doodle-bug; I'll beat yu to th' gate!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two ponies sent showers of sand all over Billy, who eyed them in
 pugnacious disgust. "Of all th' locoed imps that ever made life miserable
 fer a man, them's th' worst! Is there any piece of fool nonsense they
 hain't harnessed me with?" He beseeched of Buck. "Is there anything they
 hain't done to me? They hides my liquor; they stuffs th' sweat band of my
 hat with rope; they ties up my pants; they puts water in. My boots an'
 toads in my bunk?ain't they never goin' to get sane?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, they're only kids?they can't help it," offered Buck. "Didn't
 they hobble my cayuse when I was on him an' near bust my neck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong interrupted the conversation by driving up another calf, and
 Buck, glancing at his watch, declared the contest at an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu wins," he remarked to the newcomer. "An' now yu get scarce or Billy
 will shore straddle yore nerves. He said as how he was goin' to get square
 on yu to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't, neither, Hoppy!" earnestly contradicted Billy, who bad visions
 of a night spent in torment as a reprisal for such a threat. "Honest I
 didn't, did I, Johnny?" He asked appealingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu shore did," lied Johnny, winking at Red, who had just ridden up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what yore talkin' about, but yu shore did," replied Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If yu did," grinned Hopalong, "I'll shore make yu hard to find. Come on,
 fellows," he said; "grub's ready. Where's Frenchy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Over chewin' th' rag with Waffles about his hat?he's lost it
 again," answered Red. "He needs a guardian fer that bonnet. Th' Kid an'
 Salvation has jammed it in th' corral fence an' Waffles has to stand fer
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's put it in th' grub wagon an see him cuss cookie," suggested
 Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," indorsed Johnny; Cookie'll feed him bum grub for a week to get
 square.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong and Johnny ambled over to the corral and after some trouble
 located the missing sombrero, which they carried to the grub wagon and hid
 in the flour barrel. Then they went over by the excited owner and dropped
 a few remarks about how strange the cook was acting and how he was
 watching Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy jumped at the bait and tore over to the wagon, where he and the
 cook spent some time in mutual recrimination. Hopalong nosed around and
 finally dug up the hat, white as new-fallen snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's a hat?found it in th' dough barrel," he announced, handing
 it over to Frenchy, who received it in open-mouthed stupefaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu pie-makin' pirate! Yu didn't know where my lid was, did yu! Yu
 cross-eyed lump of hypocrisy!" yelled Frenchy, dusting off the flour with
 one full-armed swing on the cook's face, driving it into that
 unfortunate's nose and eyes and mouth. "Yu white-washed Chink, yu?rub
 yore face with water an' yu've got pancakes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey! What you doin'!" yelled the cook, kicking the spot where he had last
 seen Frenchy. "Don't yu know better'n that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu live close to yoreself or I'll throw yu so high th' sun'll duck,"
 replied Frenchy, a smile illuminating his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, cookie," remarked Hopalong confidentially, "I know who put up this
 joke on yu. Yu ask Billy who hid th' hat," suggested the tease. "Here he
 comes now?see how queer he looks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' mournful Piute," ejaculated the cook. "I'll shore make him wish he'd
 kept on his own trail. I'll flavor his slush [coffee] with year-old
 dish-rags!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this juncture Billy ambled up, keeping his weather eye peeled for
 trouble. "Who's a dish-rag?" He queried. The cook mumbled something about
 crazy hens not knowing when to quit cackling and climbed up in his wagon.
 And that night Billy swore off drinking coffee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the dawn of the next day broke, Hopalong was riding toward the Black
 Hills, leaving Billy to untie himself as best he might.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The trip was uneventful and several weeks later he entered Red Dog, a
 rambling shanty town, one of those western mushrooms that sprang up in a
 night. He took up his stand at the Miner's Rest, and finally secured six
 claims at the cost of nine hundred hard-earned dollars, a fund subscribed
 by the outfits, as it was to be a partnership affair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rode out to a staked-off piece of hillside and surveyed his purchase,
 which consisted of a patch of ground, six holes, six piles of dirt and a
 log hut. The holes showed that the claims bad been tried and found
 wanting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He dumped his pack of tools and provisions, which he had bought on the way
 up, and lugged them into the cabin. After satisfying his curiosity he went
 outside and sat down for a smoke, figuring up in his mind how much gold he
 could carry on a horse. Then, as he realized that he could get a pack mule
 to carry the surplus, he became aware of a strange presence near at hand
 and looked up into the muzzle of a Sharp's rifle. He grasped the situation
 in a flash and calmly blew several heavy smoke rings around the frowning
 barrel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" He asked slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nice day, stranger," replied the man with the rifle, "but don't yu reckon
 yu've made a mistake?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong glanced at the number burned on a near-by stake and carelessly
 blew another smoke ring. He was waiting for the gun to waver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I reckons not," he answered. "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll jest tell yu since yu asks. This yere claim's mine an' I'm a
 reg'lar terror, I am. That's why; an' seein' as it is, yu better amble
 some."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong glanced down the street and saw an interested group watching him,
 which only added to his rage for being in such a position. Then he started
 to say something, faltered and stared with horror at a point several feet
 behind his opponent. The "terror" sprang to one side in response to
 Hop-along's expression, as if fearing that a snake or some such danger
 threatened him. As he alighted in his new position he fell forward and
 Hopalong slid a smoking Colt in its holster.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several men left the distant group and ran toward the claim. Hopalong
 reached his arm inside the door and brought forth his rifle, with which he
 covered their advance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything yu want?" he shouted savagely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The men stopped and two of them started to sidle in front of two others,
 but Hopalong was not there for the purpose of permitting a move that would
 screen any gun play and he stopped the game with a warning shout. Then the
 two held up their hands and advanced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We wants to git Dan," called out one of them, nodding at the prostrate
 figure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come ahead," replied Hopalong, substituting a Colt for the rifle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They carried their badly wounded and insensible burden back to those whom
 they had left, and several curses were hurled at the cowboy, who only
 smiled grimly and entered the hut to place things ready for a siege,
 should one come. He had one hundred rounds of ammunition and provisions
 enough for two weeks, with the assurance of reinforcements long before
 that time would expire. He cut several rough loopholes and laid out his
 weapons for quick handling. He knew that he could stop any advance during
 the day and planned only for night attacks. How long he could go without
 sleep did not bother him, because he gave it no thought, as he was
 accustomed to short naps and could awaken at will or at the slightest
 sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As dusk merged into dark he crept forth and collected several handfuls of
 dry twigs, which he scattered around the hut, as the cracking of these
 would warn him of an approach. Then he went in and went to sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He awoke at daylight after a good night's rest, and feasted on canned
 beans and peaches. Then he tossed the cans out of the door and shoved his
 hat out. Receiving no response he walked out and surveyed the town at his
 feet. A sheepish grin spread over his face as he realized that there was
 no danger. Several red-shirted men passed by him on their way to town, and
 one, a grizzled veteran of many gold camps, stopped and sauntered up to
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin'," said Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin'," replied the stranger. "I thought I'd drop in an' say that I saw
 that gun-play of yourn yesterday. Yu ain't got no reason to look fer a
 rush. This camp is half white men an' half bullies, an' th' white men
 won't stand fer no play like that. Them fellers that jest passed are
 neighbors of yourn, an' they won't lay abed if yu needs them. But yu wants
 to look out fer th' joints in th' town. Guess this business is out of yore
 line," he finished as he sized Hopalong up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She shore is, but I'm here to stay. Got tired of punchin' an' reckoned
 I'd get rich." Here he smiled and glanced at the hole. "How're yu makin'
 out?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Bout five dollars a day apiece, but that ain't nothin' when grub's so
 high. Got reckless th' other day an' had a egg at fifty cents."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong whistled and glanced at the empty cans at his feet. "Any marshal
 in this burg?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep. But he's one of th' gang. No good, an' drunk half th' time an' half
 drunk th' rest. Better come down an' have something," invited the miner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd shore like to, but I can't let no gang get in that door," replied the
 puncher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's all right; I'll call my pardner down to keep house till yu
 gits back. He can hold her all right. Hey, Jake!" he called to a man who
 was some hundred paces distant; "Come down here an' keep house till we
 gits back, will yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man lumbered down to them and took possession as Hopalong and his
 newly found friend started for the town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They entered the "Miner's Rest" and Hopalong fixed the room in his mind
 with one swift glance. Three men?and they looked like the crowd he
 had stopped before?were playing poker at a table near the window.
 Hopalong leaned with his back to the bar and talked, with the players
 always in sight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon the door opened and a bewhiskered, heavy-set man tramped in, and
 walking up to Hopalong, looked him over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huh," he sneered, "Yu are th' gent with th' festive guns that plugged
 Dan, ain't yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong looked at him in the eyes and quietly replied:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' who th' deuce are yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger's eyes blazed and his face wrinkled with rage as he
 aggressively shoved his jaw close to Hopalong's face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu runt, I'm a better man than yu even if yu do wear hair pants,"
 referring to Hopalong's chaps. "Yu cow-wrastlers make me tired, an' I'm
 goin' to show yu that this town is too good for you. Yu can say it right
 now that yu are a ornery, game-leg?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong smashed his insulter squarely between the eyes with all the power
 of his sinewy body behind the blow, knocking him in a heap under the
 table. Then he quickly glanced at the card players and saw a hostile
 movement. His gun was out in a flash and he covered the trio as he walked
 up to them. Never in all his life had he felt such a desire to kill. His
 eyes were diamond points of accumulated fury, and those whom he faced
 quailed before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu scum! Draw, please draw! Pull yore guns an' gimme my chance! Three to
 one, an' I'll lay my guns here," he said, placing them on the bar and
 removing his hands. "'Nearer My God to Thee' is purty appropriate fer yu
 just now! Yu seem to be a-scared of yore own guns. Git down on yore dirty
 knees an' say good an' loud that yu eats dirt! Shout out that yu are too
 currish to live with decent men," he said, even-toned and distinct, his
 voice vibrant with passion as he took up his Colts. "Get down!" he
 repeated, shoving the weapons forward and pulling back the hammers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The trio glanced at each other, and all three dropped to their knees and
 repeated in venomous hatred the words Hopalong said for them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now git! An' if I sees yu when I leaves I'll send yu after yore friend.
 I'll shoot on sight now. Git!" He escorted them to the door and kicked the
 last one out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His miner friend still leaned against the bar and looked his approval.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well done, youngster! But yu wants to look out?that man," pointing
 to the now groping victim of Hopalong's blow, "is th' marshal of this
 town. He or his pals will get yu if yu don't watch th' corners."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong walked over to the marshal, jerked him to his feet and slammed
 him against the bar. Then he tore the cheap badge from its place and threw
 it on the floor. Reaching down, he drew the marshal's revolver from its
 holster and shoved it in its owner's hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore th' marshal of this place an' it's too good for me, but yore gain'
 to pick up that tin lie," pointing at the badge, "an' yore goin' to do it
 right now. Then yore gain' to get kicked out of that door, an' if yu stops
 runnin' while I can see yu I'll fill yu so full of holes yu'll catch cold.
 Yore a sumptious marshal, yu are! Yore th' snortingest ki-yi that ever
 stuck its tail atween its laigs, yu are. Yu pop-eyed wall flower, yu wants
 to peep to yoreself or some papoose'll slide yu over th' Divide so fast yu
 won't have time to grease yore pants. Pick up that license-tag an' let me
 see you perculate so lively that yore back'll look like a ten-cent piece
 in five seconds. Flit!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The marshal, dazed and bewildered, stooped and fumbled for the badge. Then
 he stood up and glanced at the gun in his hand and at the eager man before
 him. He slid the weapon in his belt and drew his hand across his
 fast-closing eyes. Cursing streaks of profanity, he staggered to the door
 and landed in a heap in the street from the force of Hopalong's kick.
 Struggling to his feet, he ran unsteadily down the block and disappeared
 around a corner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bartender, cool and unperturbed, pushed out three glasses on his
 treat: "I've seen yu afore, up in Cheyenne?'member? How's yore
 friend Red?" He asked as he filled the glasses with the best the house
 afforded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, shore 'nuff! Glad to see yu, Jimmy! What yu doin' away off here?"
 Asked Hopalong, beginning to feel at home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, jest filterin' round like. I'm awful glad to see yu?this yere
 wart of a town needs siftin' out. It was only last week I was wishin' one
 of yore bunch 'ud show up?that ornament yu jest buffaloed shore
 raised th' devil in here, an' I wished I had somebody to prospect his
 anatomy for a lead mine. But he's got a tough gang circulating with him.
 Ever hear of Dutch Shannon or Blinky Neary? They's with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dutch Shannon? Nope," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bad eggs, an' not a-carin' how they gits square. Th' feller yu' salted
 yesterday was a bosom friend of th' marshal's, an' he passed in his chips
 last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep. Bought a bottle of ready-made nerve an' went to his own funeral.
 Aristotle Smith was lookin' fer him up in Cheyenne last year. Aristotle
 said he'd give a century fer five minutes' palaver with him, but he shied
 th' town an' didn't come back. Yu know Aristotle, don't yu? He's th'
 geezer that made fame up to Poison Knob three years ago. He used to go to
 town ridin' astride a log on th' lumber flume. Made four miles in six
 minutes with th' promise of a ruction when he stopped. Once when he was
 loaded he tried to ride back th' same way he came, an' th' first thing he
 knowed he was three miles farther from his supper an' a-slippin' down that
 valley like he wanted to go somewhere. He swum out at Potter's Dam an' it
 took him a day to walk back. But he didn't make that play again, because
 he was frequently sober, an' when he wasn't he'd only stand off an' swear
 at th' slide."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's Aristotle, all hunk. He's th' chap that used to play checkers with
 Deacon Rawlins. They used empty an' loaded shells for men, an' when they
 got a king they'd lay one on its side. Sometimes they'd jar th' board an'
 they'd all be kings an' then they'd have a cussin' match," replied
 Hopalong, once more restored to good humor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," responded Jimmy, "he counted his wealth over twice by mistake an'
 shore raised a howl when he went to blow it?thought he's been
 robbed, an' laid behind th' houses fer a week lookin' fer th' feller that
 done it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've heard of that cuss?he shore was th' limit. What become of
 him?" Asked the miner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He ambled up to Laramie an' stuck his head in th' window of that joint by
 th' plaza an' hollered 'Fire,' an' they did. He was shore a good feller,
 all th' same," answered the bartender. Hopalong laughed and started for
 the door. Turning around he looked at his miner friend and asked: "Comin'
 along? I'm goin' back now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. Reckon I'll hit th' tiger a whirl. I'll stop in when I passes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. So long," replied Hopalong, slipping out of the door and
 watching for trouble. There was no opposition shown him, and he arrived at
 his claim to find Jake in a heated argument with another of the gang.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here he comes now," he said as Hopalong walked up. "Tell him what yu said
 to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I said yu made a mistake," said the other, turning to the cowboy in a
 half apologetic manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' what else?" Insisted Jake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, ain't that all?" Asked the claim-jumper's friend in feigned
 surprise, wishing that he had kept quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well I reckons it is if yu can't back up yore words," responded Jake in
 open contempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong grabbed the intruder by the collar of his shirt and hauled him
 off the claim. "Yu keep off this, understand? I just kicked yore marshal
 out in th' street, an' I'll pay yu th' next call. If yu rambles in range
 of my guns yu'll shore get in th' way of a slug. Yu an' yore gang wants to
 browse on th' far side of th' range or yu'll miss a sunrise some mornin'.
 Scoot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong turned to his companion and smiled. "What'd he say?" He asked
 genially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he jest shot off his mouth a little. They's all no good. I've
 collided with lots of them all over this country. They can't face a good
 man an' keep their nerve. What'd yu say to th' marshal?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told him what he was an' threw him outen th' street," replied Hopalong.
 "In about two weeks we'll have a new marshal an' he'll shore be a dandy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes? Why don't yu take th' job yoreself? We're with yu."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Better man comin'. Ever hear of Buck Peters or Red Connors of th' Bar-20,
 Texas?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buck Peters? Seems to me I have. Did he punch fer th' Tin-Cup up in
 Montana, 'bout twenty years back?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore! Him and Frenchy McAllister punched all over that country an' they
 used to paint Cheyenne, too," replied Hopalong, eagerly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knows him, then. I used to know Frenchy, too. Are they comin' up here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," responded Hopalong, struggling with another can while waiting for
 the fire to catch up. "Better have some grub with me?don't like to
 eat alone," invited the cowboy, the reaction of his late rage swinging him
 to the other extreme.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When their tobacco had got well started at the close of the meal and
 content had taken possession of them Hopalong laughed quietly and finally
 spoke:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu ever know Aristotle Smith when yu was up in Montana?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did I! Well, me an' Aristotle prospected all through that country till he
 got so locoed I had to watch him fer fear he'd blow us both up. He greased
 th' fryin' pan with dynamite one night, an' we shore had to eat jerked
 meat an' canned stuff all th' rest of that trip. What made yu ask? Is he
 comin' up too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I reckons not. Jimmy, th' bartender, said that he cashed in up at
 Laramie. Wasn't he th' cuss that built that boat out there on th' Arizona
 desert because he was scared that a flood might come? Th' sun shore warped
 that punt till it wasn't even good for a hencoop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. That was Sister?Annie Tompkins. He was purty near as bad as
 Aristotle, though. He roped a puma up on th' Sacramentos, an' didn't punch
 no more fer three weeks. Well, here comes my pardner an' I reckons I'll
 amble right along. If yu needs any referee or a side pardner in any
 ruction yu has only got to warble up my way. So long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next ten days passed quietly, and on the afternoon of the eleventh
 Hopalong's miner friend paid him a visit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jake recommends yore peaches," he laughed as he shook Hopalong's hand.
 "He says yu boosted another of that crowd. That bein' so I thought I would
 drop in an' say that they're comin' after yu to-night, shore. Just heard
 of it from yore friend Jimmy. Yu can count on us when th' rush comes. But
 why didn't yu say yu was a pard of Buck Peters'? Me an' him used to shoot
 up Laramie together. From what yore friend James says, yu can handle this
 gang by yore lonesome, but if yu needs any encouragement yu make some sign
 an' we'll help th' event along some. They's eight of us that'll be waitin'
 up to get th' returns an' we're shore goin' to be in range."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gee, it's nice to run across a friend of Buck's! Ain't he a
 son-of-a-gun?" Asked Hopalong, delighted at the news. Then, without
 waiting for a reply, he went on: "Yore shore square, all right, an' I
 hates to refuse yore offer, but I got eighteen friends comin' up an' they
 ought to get here by tomorrow. Yu tell Jimmy to head them this way when
 they shows up an' I'll have th' claim for them. There ain't no use of yu
 fellers gettin' mixed up in this. Th' bunch that's comin' can clean out
 any gang this side of sunup, an' I expects they'll shore be anxious to
 begin when they finds me eatin' peaches an' wastin' my time shootin' bums.
 Yu pass th' word along to yore friends, an' tell them to lay low an' see
 th' Arory Boerallis hit this town with its tail up. Tell Jimmy to do it up
 good when he speaks about me holdin' th' claim?I likes to see Buck
 an' Red fight when they're good an' mad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The miner laughed and slapped Hopalong on the shoulder. "Yore all right,
 youngster! Yore just like Buck was at yore age. Say now, I reckons he
 wasn't a reg'lar terror on wheels! Why, I've seen him do more foolish
 things than any man I knows of, an' I calculate that if Buck pals with yu
 there ain't no water in yore sand. My name's Tom Halloway," he suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' mine's Hopalong Cassidy," was the reply. "I've heard Buck speak of
 yu."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has yu? Well, don't it beat all how little this world is? Somebody allus
 turnin' up that knows somebody yu knows. I'll just amble along, Mr.
 Cassidy, an' don't yu be none bashful about callin' if yu needs me. Any
 pal of Buck's is my friend. Well, so long," said the visitor as he strode
 off. Then he stopped and turned around. "Hey, mister!" he called. "They
 are goin' to roll a fire barrel down agin yu from behind," indicating by
 an outstretched arm the point from where it would start. "If it burns yu
 out I'm goin' to take a band from up there," pointing to a cluster of
 rocks well to the rear of where the crowd would work from, "an' I don't
 care whether yu likes it or not," he added to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong scratched his head and then laughed. Taking up a pick and shovel,
 he went out behind the cabin and dug a trench parallel with and about
 twenty paces away from the rear wall. Heaping the excavated dirt up on the
 near side of the cut, he stepped back and surveyed his labor with open
 satisfaction. "Roll yore fire barrel an' be dogged," he muttered. "Mebby
 she won't make a bully light for pot shots, though," he added, grinning at
 the execution he would do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taking up his tools, he went up to the place from where the gang would
 roll the barrel, and made half a dozen mounds of twigs, being careful to
 make them very flimsy. Then he covered them with earth and packed them
 gently. The mounds looked very tempting from the view-point of a marksman
 in search of earth-works, and appeared capable of stopping any rifle ball
 that could be fired against them. Hopalong looked them over critically and
 stepped back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd like to see th' look on th' face of th' son-of-a-gun that uses them
 for cover?won't he be surprised" and he grinned gleefully as he
 pictured his shots boring through them. Then he placed in the center of
 each a chip or a pebble or something that he thought would show up well in
 the firelight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Returning to the cabin, he banked it up well with dirt and gravel, and
 tossed a few shovelfuls up on the roof as a safety valve to his
 exuberance. When he entered the door he had another idea, and fell to work
 scooping out a shallow cellar, deep enough to shelter him when lying at
 full length. Then he stuck his head out of the window and grinned at the
 false covers with their prominent bull's-eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When that prize-winnin' gang of ossified idiots runs up agin' these
 fortifications they shore will be disgusted. I'll bet four dollars an'
 seven cents they'll think their medicine-man's no good. I hopes that
 puff-eyed marshal will pick out that hump with th' chip on it," and he
 hugged himself in anticipation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He then cut down a sapling and fastened it to the roof and on it he tied
 his neckerchief, which fluttered valiantly and with defiance in the light
 breeze. "I shore hopes they appreciates that," he remarked whimsically, as
 he went inside the hut and closed the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The early part of the evening passed in peace, and Hopalong, tired of
 watching in vain, wished for action. Midnight came, and it was not until
 half an hour before dawn that he was attacked. Then a noise sent him to a
 loophole, where he fired two shots at skulking figures some distance off.
 A fusillade of bullets replied; one of them ripped through the door at a
 weak spot and drilled a hole in a can of the everlasting peaches. Hopalong
 set the can in the frying pan and then flitted from loophole to loophole,
 shooting quick and straight. Several curses told him that he had not
 missed, and he scooped up a finger of peach juice. Shots thudded into the
 walls of his fort in an unceasing stream, and, as it grew lighter, several
 whizzed through the loopholes. He kept close to the earth and waited for
 the rush, and when it came sent it back, minus two of its members.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he reloaded his Colts a bullet passed through his shirt sleeve and he
 promptly nailed the marksman. He looked out of a crack in the rear wall
 and saw the top of an adjoining hill crowned with spectators, all of whom
 were armed. Some time later he repulsed another attack and heard a faint
 cheer from his friends on the hill. Then he saw a barrel, blazing from end
 to end, roll out from the place he had so carefully covered with mounds.
 It gathered speed and bounded over the rough ground, flashed between two
 rocks and leaped into the trench, where it crackled and roared in vain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," said Hopalong, blazing at the mounds as fast as he could fire his
 rifle, "we'll just see what yu thinks of yore nice little covers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yells of consternation and pain rang out in a swelling chorus, and legs
 and arms jerked and flopped, one man, in his astonishment at the shot that
 tore open his cheek, sitting up in plain sight of the marksman. Roars of
 rage floated up from the main body of the besiegers, and the discomfited
 remnant of barrel-rollers broke for real cover.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he stopped another rush from the front, made upon the supposition
 that he was thinking only of the second detachment. A hearty cheer arose
 from Tom Halloway and his friends, ensconced in their rocky position, and
 it was taken up by those on the hill, who danced and yelled their delight
 at the battle, to them more humorous than otherwise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This recognition of his prowess from men of the caliber of his audience
 made him feel good, and he grinned: "Gee, I'll bet Halloway an' his
 friends is shore itchin' to get in this," he murmured, firing at a head
 that was shown for an instant. "Wonder what Red'll say when Jimmy tells
 him?bet he'll plow dust like a cyclone," and Hopalong laughed,
 picturing to himself the satiation of Red's anger. "Old red-headed
 son-of-a-gun," murmured the cowboy affectionately, "he shore can fight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he squinted over the sights of his rifle his eye caught sight of a
 moving body of men as they cantered over the flats about two miles away.
 In his eagerness he forgot to shoot and carefully counted them. "Nine," he
 grumbled. "Wonder what's th' matter?" Fearing that they were not his
 friends. Then a second body numbering eight cantered into sight and
 followed the first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whoop! There's th' Red-head!" he shouted, dancing in his joy. "Now," he
 shouted at the peach can joyously, "yu wait about thirty minutes an' yu'll
 shore reckon Hades has busted loose!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He grabbed up his Colts, which he kept loaded for repelling rushes, and
 recklessly emptied them into the bushes and between the rocks and trees,
 searching every likely place for a human target. Then he slipped his rifle
 in a loophole and waited for good shots, having worked off the dangerous
 pressure of his exuberance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon he heard a yell from the direction of the "Miner's Rest," and fell to
 jamming cartridges into his revolvers so that he could sally out and join
 in the fray by the side of Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thunder of madly pounding hoofs rolled up the trail, and soon a horse
 and rider shot around the corner and headed for the copse. Three more
 raced close behind and then a bunch of six, followed by the rest, spread
 out and searched for trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red, a Colt in each hand and hatless, stood up in his stirrups and sent
 shot after shot into the fleeing mob, which he could not follow on account
 of the nature of the ground. Buck wheeled and dashed down the trail again
 with Red a close second, the others packed in a solid mass and after them.
 At the first level stretch the newcomers swept down and hit their enemies,
 going through them like a knife through cheese. Hopalong danced up and
 down with rage when he could not find his horse, and had to stand and
 yell, a spectator.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fight drifted in among the buildings, where it became a series of
 isolated duels, and soon Hopalong saw panic-stricken horses carrying their
 riders out of the other side of the town. Then he went gunning for the man
 who had rustled his horse. He was unsuccessful and returned to his
 peaches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon the riders came up, and when they saw Hopalong shove a peach into his
 powder-grimed mouth they yelled their delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu old maverick! Eatin' peaches like yu was afraid we'd git some!"
 shouted Red indignantly, leaping down and running up to his pal as though
 to thrash him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong grinned pleasantly and fired a peach against Red's eye. "I was
 savin' that one for yu, Reddie," he remarked, as he avoided Buck's playful
 kick. "Yu fellers git to work an' dig up some wealth?I'm hungry."
 Then he turned to Buck: "Yore th' marshal of this town, an' any
 son-of-a-gun what don't like it had better write. Oh, yes, here comes Tom
 Halloway?'member him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck turned and faced the miner and his hand went out with a jerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be locoed if I didn't punch with yu on th' Tin-Cup!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu shore did an' yu was purty devilish, but that there Cassidy of yourn
 beats anything I ever seen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's a good kid," replied Buck, glancing to where Red and Hopalong were
 quarreling as to who had eaten the most pie in a contest held some years
 before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny, nosing around, came upon the perforated and partially scattered
 piles of earth and twigs, and vented his disgust of them by kicking them
 to pieces. "Hey! Hoppy! Oh, Hoppy!" he called, "what are these things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong jammed Red's hat over that person's eyes and replied: "Oh, them's
 some loaded dice I fixed for them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu son-of-a-gun!" sputtered Red, as he wrestled with his friend in the
 exuberance of his pride. "Yu son-of-a-gun! Yu shore ought to be ashamed to
 treat 'em that way!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," replied Hopalong. "But I ain't!"
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XII. The Hospitality of Travennes
 </h2>
 <p>
 Mr. Buck Peters rode into Alkaline one bright September morning and sought
 refreshment at the Emporium. Mr. Peters had just finished some business
 for his employer and felt the satisfaction that comes with the knowledge
 of work well done. He expected to remain in Alkaline for several days,
 where he was to be joined by two of his friends and punchers, Mr. Hopalong
 Cassidy and Mr. Red Connors, both of whom were at Cactus Springs, seventy
 miles to the east. Mr. Cassidy and his friend had just finished a
 nocturnal tour of Santa Fe and felt somewhat peevish and dull in
 consequence, not to mention the sadness occasioned by the expenditure of
 the greater part of their combined capital on such foolishness as faro,
 roulette and wet-goods.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Peters and his friends had sought wealth in the Black Hills, where
 they had enthusiastically disfigured the earth in the fond expectation of
 uncovering vast stores of virgin gold. Their hopes were of an optimistic
 brand and had existed until the last canister of cornmeal flour had been
 emptied by Mr. Cassidy's burro, which waited not upon it's master's
 pleasure nor upon the ethics of the case. When Mr. Cassidy had returned
 from exercising the animal and himself over two miles of rocky hillside in
 the vain endeavor to give it his opinion of burros and sundry
 chastisements, he was requested, as owner of the beast, to give his
 counsel as to the best way of securing eighteen breakfasts. Remembering
 that the animal was headed north when he last saw it and that it was too
 old to eat, anyway, he suggested a plan which had worked successfully at
 other times for other ends, namely, poker. Mr. McAllister, an expert at
 the great American game, volunteered his service in accordance with the
 spirit of the occasion and, half an hour later, he and Mr. Cassidy drifted
 into Pell's poker parlors, which were located in the rear of a Chinese
 laundry, where they gathered unto themselves the wherewithal for the
 required breakfasts. An hour spent in the card room of the "Hurrah"
 convinced its proprietor that they had wasted their talents for the past
 six weeks in digging for gold. The proof of this permitted the departure
 of the outfits with their customary elan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At Santa Fe the various individuals had gone their respective ways, to
 reassemble at the ranch in the near future, and for several days they had
 been drifting south in groups of twos and threes and, like chaff upon a
 stream, had eddied into Alkaline, where Mr. Peters had found them
 arduously engaged in postponing the final journey. After he had gladdened
 their hearts and soothed their throats by making several pithy remarks to
 the bartender, with whom he established their credit, he cautioned them
 against letting any one harm them and, smiling at the humor of his
 warning, left abruptly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cactus Springs was burdened with a zealous and initiative organization
 known as vigilantes, whose duty it was to extend the courtesies of the
 land to cattle thieves and the like. This organization boasted of the name
 of Travennes' Terrors and of a muster roll of twenty. There was also a
 boast that no one had ever escaped them which, if true, was in many cases
 unfortunate. Mr. Slim Travennes, with whom Mr. Cassidy had participated in
 an extemporaneous exchange of Colt's courtesies in Santa Fe the year
 before, was the head of the organization and was also chairman of the
 committee on arrivals, and the two gentlemen of the Bar-20 had not been in
 town an hour before he knew of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Being anxious to show the strangers every attention and having a keen
 recollection of the brand of gun-play commanded by Mr. Cassidy, he planned
 a smoother method of procedure and one calculated to permit him to enjoy
 the pleasures of a good old age. Mr. Travennes knew that horse thieves
 were regarded as social enemies, that the necessary proof of their guilt
 was the finding of stolen animals in their possession, that death was the
 penalty and that every man, whether directly concerned or not, regarded,
 himself as judge, jury and executioner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had several acquaintances who were bound to him by his knowledge of
 crimes they had committed and would could not refuse his slightest wish.
 Even if they had been free agents they were not above causing the death of
 an innocent man. Mr. Travennes, feeling very self-satisfied at his
 cleverness, arranged to have the proof placed where it would do the most
 harm and intended to take care of the rest by himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors, feeling much refreshed and very hungry, arose at daylight the
 next morning, and dressing quickly, started off to feed and water the
 horses. After having several tilts with the landlord about the bucket he
 took his departure toward the corral at the rear. Peering through the
 gate, he could hardly believe his eyes. He climbed over it and inspected
 the animals at close range, and found that those which he and his friend
 had ridden for the last two months were not to be seen, but in their
 places were two better animals, which concerned him greatly. Being fair
 and square himself, he could not understand the change and sought
 enlightenment of his more imaginative and suspicious friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, Hopalong!" he called, "come out here an' see what th' blazes has
 happened!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy stuck his auburn head out of the wounded shutter and
 complacently surveyed his companion. Then he saw the horses and looked
 hard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quit yore foolin', yu old cuss," he remarked pleasantly, as he groped
 around behind him with his feet, searching for his boots. "Anybody would
 think yu was a little boy with yore fool jokes. Ain't yu ever goin' to
 grow up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They've got our bronch," replied Mr. Connors in an injured tone. "Honest,
 I ain't kiddin' yu," he added for the sake of peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who has?" Came from the window, followed immediately by, "Yu've got my
 boots!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ain't?they're under th' bunk," contradicted and explained Mr.
 Connors. Then, turning to the matter in his mind he replied, "I don't know
 who's got them. If I did do yu think I'd be holdin' hands with myself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody'd accuse yu of anything like that," came from the window,
 accompanied by an overdone snicker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors flushed under his accumulated tan as he remembered the varied
 pleasures of Santa Fe, and he regarded the bronchos in anything but a
 pleasant state of mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy slid through the window and approached his friend, looking as
 serious as he could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any tracks?" He inquired, as he glanced quickly over the ground to see
 for himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not after that wind we had last night. They might have growed there for
 all I can see," growled Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon we better hold a pow-wow with th' foreman of this shack an' find
 out what he knows," suggested Mr. Cassidy. "This looks too good to be a
 swap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors looked his disgust at the idea and then a light broke in upon
 him. "Mebby they was hard pushed an' wanted fresh cayuses," he said. "A
 whole lot of people get hard pushed in this country. Anyhow, we'll
 prospect th' boss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found the proprietor in his stocking feet, getting the breakfast, and
 Mr. Cassidy regarded the preparations with open approval. He counted the
 tin plates and found only three, and, thinking that there would be more
 plates if there were others to feed, glanced into the landlord's room. Not
 finding signs of other guests, on whom to lay the blame for the loss of
 his horse, he began to ask questions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Much trade?" He inquired solicitously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep," replied the landlord.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy looked at the three tins and wondered if there had ever been
 any more with which to supply his trade. "Been out this morning?" he
 pursued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Talks purty nigh as much as Buck," thought Mr. Cassidy, and then said
 aloud, "Anybody else here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy lapsed into a painful and disgusted silence and his friend
 tried his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who owns a mosaic bronch, Chinee flag on th' near side, Skillet brand?"
 asked Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quien sabe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gosh, he can nearly keep still in two lingoes," thought Mr. Cassidy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who owns a bob-tailed pinto, saddle-galled, cast in th' near eye, Star
 Diamond brand, white stockin' on th' off front prop, with a habit of
 scratchin' itself every other minute?" went on Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Slim Travennes," replied the proprietor, flopping a flapjack. Mr. Cassidy
 reflectively scratched the back of his hand and looked innocent, but his
 mind was working overtime.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's Slim Travennes?" Asked Mr. Connors, never having heard of that
 person, owing to the reticence of his friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Captain of th' vigilantes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does he look like on th' general run?" Blandly inquired Mr. Cassidy,
 wishing to verify his suspicions. He thought of the trouble he had with
 Mr. Travennes up in Santa Fe and of the reputation that gentleman
 possessed. Then the fact that Mr. Travennes was the leader of the local
 vigilantes came to his assistance and he was sure that the captain had a
 hand in the change. All these points existed in misty groups in his mind,
 but the next remark of the landlord caused them to rush together and
 reveal the plot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good," said the landlord, flopping another flapjack, "and a warnin' to
 hoss thieves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahem," coughed Mr. Cassidy and then continued, "is he a tall, lanky,
 yaller-headed son-of-a-gun, with a big nose an' lots of ears?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby so," answered the host.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Urn, slopping over into bad Sioux," thought Mr. Cassidy, and then said
 aloud, "How long has he hung around this here layout?" At the same time
 passing a warning glance at his companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlord straightened up. "Look here, stranger, if yu hankers after
 his pedigree so all-fired hard yu had best pump him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told yu this here feller wasn't a man what would give away all he
 knowed," lied Mr. Connors, turning to his friend and indicating the host.
 "He ain't got time for that. Anybody can see that he is a powerful busy
 man. An' then he ain't no child."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy thought that the landlord could tell all he knew in about five
 minutes and then not break any speed records for conversation, but he
 looked properly awed and impressed. "Well, yu needn't go an' get mad about
 it! I didn't know, did I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's gettin' mad?" Pugnaciously asked Mr. Connors. After his injured
 feelings had been soothed by Mr. Cassidy's sullen silence he again turned
 to the landlord.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did this Travennes look like when yu saw him last?" Coaxed Mr.
 Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' same as he does now, as yu can see by lookin' out of th' window.
 That's him down th' street," enlightened the host, thawing to the pleasant
 Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy adopted the suggestion and frowned. Mr. Travennes and two
 companions were walking toward the corral and Mr. Cassidy once again slid
 out of the window, his friend going by the door.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIII. Travennes' Discomfiture
 </h2>
 <p>
 When Mr. Travennes looked over the corral fence he was much chagrined to
 see a man and a Colt both paying strict attention to his nose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin', Duke," said the man with the gun. "Lose anything?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes looked back at his friends and saw Mr. Connors sitting on a
 rock holding two guns. Mr. Travennes' right and left wings were the
 targets and they pitted their frowns against Mr. Connors' smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not that I knows of," replied Mr. Travennes, shifting his feet uneasily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Find anything?" Came from Mr. Cassidy as he sidled out of the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope," replied the captain of the Terrors, eying the Colt. "Are yu in the
 habit of payin' early mornin' calls to this here corral?" persisted Mr.
 Cassidy, playing with the gun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ya-as. That's my business?I'm th' captain of the vigilantes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's too bad," sympathized Mr. Cassidy, moving forward a step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes looked put out and backed off. "What yu mean, stickin' me up
 this-away?" He asked indignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu needn't go an' get mad," responded Mr. Cassidy. "Just business. Yore
 cayuse an' another shore climbed this corral fence last night an' ate up
 our bronchs, an' I just nachurly want to know about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes looked his surprise and incredulity and craned his neck to
 see for himself. When he saw his horse peacefully scratching itself he
 swore and looked angrily up the street. Mr. Connors, behind the shack, was
 hidden to the view of those on the street, and when two men ran up at a
 signal from Mr. Travennes, intending to insert themselves in the
 misunderstanding, they were promptly lined up with the first two by the
 man on the rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit down," invited Mr. Connors, pushing a chunk of air out of the way
 with his guns. The last two felt a desire to talk and to argue the case on
 its merits, but refrained as the black holes in Mr. Connors' guns hinted
 at eruption. "Every time yu opens yore mouths yu gets closer to th' Great
 Divide," enlightened that person, and they were childlike in their belief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes acted as though he would like to scratch his thigh where his
 Colt's chafed him, but postponed the event and listened to Mr. Cassidy,
 who was asking questions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's our cayuses, General?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes replied that he didn't know. He was worried, for he feared
 that his captor didn't have a secure hold on the hammer of the ubiquitous
 Colt's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's my cayuse?" Persisted Mr. Cassidy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know, but I wants to ask yu how yu got mine," replied Mr.
 Travennes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu tell me how mine got out an' I'll tell yu how yourn got in," countered
 Mr. Cassidy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors added another to his collection before the captain replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out in this country people get in trouble when they're found with other
 folks' cayuses," Mr. Travennes suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy looked interested and replied: "Yu shore ought to borrow some
 experience, an' there's lots floating around. More than one man has smoked
 in a powder mill, an' th' number of them planted who looked in th' muzzle
 of a empty gun is scandalous. If my remarks don't perculate right smart
 I'll explain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes looked down the street again, saw number five added to the
 line-up, and coughed up chunks of broken profanity, grieving his host by
 his lack of courtesy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Time," announced Mr. Cassidy, interrupting the round. "I wants them
 cayuses an' I wants 'em right now. Yu an' me will amble off an' get 'em. I
 won't bore yu with tellin' yu what'll happen if yu gets skittish. Slope
 along an' don't be scared; I'm with yu," assured Mr. Cassidy as he looked
 over at Mr. Connors, whose ascetic soul pined for the flapjacks of which
 his olfactories caught intermittent whiffs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Red, I reckons yu has got plenty of room out here for all yu may
 corral; anyhow there ain't a whole lot more. My friend Slim an' I are
 shore going to have a devil of a time if we can t find them cussed
 bronchs. Whew, them flapjacks smell like a plain trail to payday. Just
 think of th' nice maple juice we used to get up to Cheyenne on them frosty
 mornings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get out of here an' lemme alone! 'What do yu allus want to go an' make a
 feller unhappy for? Can't yu keep still about grub when yu knows I ain't
 had my morning's feed yet?" Asked Mr. Connors, much aggrieved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be back directly an' I'll have them cayuses or a scalp. Yu
 tend to business an' watch th' herd. That shorthorn yearling at th' end of
 th' line"?pointing to a young man who looked capable of taking risks?"he
 looks like he might take a chance an' gamble with yu," remarked Mr.
 Cassidy, placing Mr. Travennes in front of him and pushing back his own
 sombrero. "Don't put too much maple juice on them flapjacks, Red," he
 warned as he poked his captive in the back of the neck as a hint to get
 along. Fortunately Mr. Connors' closing remarks are lost to history.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Observing that Mr. Travennes headed south on the quest, Mr. Cassidy
 reasoned that the missing bronchos ought to be somewhere in the north, and
 he postponed the southern trip until such time when they would have more
 leisure at their disposal. Mr. Travennes showed a strong inclination to
 shy at this arrangement, but quieted down under persuasion, and they
 started off toward where Mr. Cassidy firmly believed the North Pole and
 the cayuses to be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu has got quite a metropolis here," pleasantly remarked Mr. Cassidy as
 under his direction they made for a distant corral. "I can see four
 different types of architecture, two of 'em on one residence," he
 continued as they passed a wood and adobe hut. "No doubt the railroad will
 put a branch down here some day an' then yu can hire their old cars for
 yore public buildings. Then when yu gets a post-office yu will shore make
 Chicago hustle some to keep her end up. Let's assay that hollow for
 horse-hide; it looks promisin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hollow was investigated but showed nothing other than cactus and baked
 alkali. The corral came next, and there too was emptiness. For an hour the
 search was unavailing, but at the end of that time Mr. Cassidy began to
 notice signs of nervousness on the part of his guest, which grew less as
 they proceeded. Then Mr. Cassidy retraced their steps to the place where
 the nervousness first developed and tried another way and once more
 returned to the starting point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu seems to hanker for this fool exercise," quoth Mr. Trayennes with much
 sarcasm. "If yu reckons I'm fond of this locoed ramblin' yu shore needs
 enlightenment."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes I do get these fits," confessed Mr. Cassidy, "an' when I do I'm
 dead sore on objections. Let's peek in that there hut," he suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huh; yore ideas of cayuses are mighty peculiar. Why don't you look for
 'em up on those cactuses or behind that mesquite? I wouldn't be a heap
 surprised if they was roostin' on th' roof. They are mighty knowing
 animals, cayuses. I once saw one that could figger like a schoolmarm,"
 remarked Mr. Travennes, beginning sarcastically and toning it down as he
 proceeded, out of respect for his companion's gun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they might be in th' shack," replied Mr. Cassidy. "Cayuses know so
 much that it takes a month to unlearn them. I wouldn't like to bet they
 ain't in that hut, though."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes snickered in a manner decidedly uncomplimentary and began to
 whistle, softly at first. The gentleman from the Bar-20 noticed that his
 companion was a musician; that when he came to a strong part he increased
 the tones until they bid to be heard at several hundred yards. When Mr.
 Travennes had reached a most passionate part in "Juanita" and was
 expanding his lungs to do it justice he was rudely stopped by the
 insistent pressure of his guard's Colt's on the most ticklish part of his
 ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shore wish yu wouldn't strain yoreself thataway," said Mr. Cassidy,
 thinking that Mr. Travennes might be endeavoring to call assistance. "I
 went an' promised my mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't let nobody
 whistle out loud like that, an' th' opery is hereby stopped. Besides,
 somebody might hear them mournful tones an' think that something is th'
 matter, which it ain't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes substituted heartfelt cursing, all of which was heavily
 accented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they approached the hut Mr. Cassidy again tickled his prisoner and
 insisted that he be very quiet, as his cayuse was very sensitive to noise
 and it might be there. Mr. Cassidy still thought Mr. Travennes might have
 friends in the hut and wouldn't for the world disturb them, as he would
 present a splendid target as he approached the building.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIV. The Tale of a Cigarette
 </h2>
 <p>
 The open door revealed three men asleep on the earthen floor, two of whom
 were Mexicans. Mr. Cassidy then for the first time felt called upon to
 relieve his companion of the Colt's which so sorely itched that
 gentleman's thigh and then disarmed the sleeping guards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One man an' a half," murmured Mr. Cassidy, it being in his creed that it
 took four Mexicans to make one Texan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the far corner of the room were two bronchos, one of which tried in
 vain to kick Mr. Cassidy, not realizing that he was ten feet away. The
 noise awakened the sleepers, who sat up and then sprang to their feet,
 their hands instinctively streaking to their thighs for the weapons which
 peeked contentedly from the bosom of Mr. Cassidy's open shirt. One of the
 Mexicans made a lightning-like grab for the back of his neck for the knife
 which lay along his spine and was shot in the front of his neck for his
 trouble. The shot spoiled his aim, as the knife flashed past Mr. Cassidy's
 arm, wide by two feet, and thudded into the door frame, where it hummed
 angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The only man who could do that right was th' man who invented it, Mr.
 Bowie, of Texas," explained Mr. Cassidy to the other Mexican. Then he
 glanced at the broncho, that was squealing in rage and fear at the shot,
 which sounded like a cannon in the small room, and laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's my cayuse, all right, an' he wasn't up no cactus nor roostin' on
 th' roof, neither. He's th' most affectionate beast I ever saw. It took me
 nigh onto six months afore I could ride him without fighting him to a
 standstill," said Mr. Cassidy to his guest. Then he turned to the horse
 and looked it over. "Come here! What d'yu mean, acting thataway? Yu ragged
 end of nothin' wobbling in space! Yu wall-eyed, ornery, locoed guide to
 Hades! Yu won't be so frisky when yu've made them seventy hot miles
 between here an' Alkaline in five hours," he promised, as he made his way
 toward the animal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes walked over to the opposite wall and took down a pouch of
 tobacco which hung from a peg. He did this in a manner suggesting
 ownership, and after he had deftly rolled a cigarette with one hand he put
 the pouch in his pocket and, lighting up, inhaled deeply and with much
 satisfaction. Mr. Cassidy turned around and glanced the group over,
 wondering if the tobacco had been left in the hut on a former call.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu find yore makings?" He asked, with a note of congratulations in
 his voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yep. Want one?" Asked Mr. Travennes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy ignored the offer and turned to the guard whom he had found
 asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that his tobacco?" He asked, and the guard, anxious to make everything
 run smoothly, told the truth and answered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore. He left it here last night," whereupon Mr. Travennes swore and Mr.
 Cassidy smiled grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then yu knows how yore cayuse got in an' how mine got out," said the
 latter. "I wish yu would explain," he added, fondling his Colts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes frowned and remained silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can tell yu, anyhow," continued Mr. Cassidy, still smiling, but his
 eyes and jaw belied the smile. "Yu took them cayuses out because yu wanted
 yourn to be found in their places. Yu remembered Santa Fe an' it rankled
 in yu. Not being man enough to notify me that yu'd shoot on sight an'
 being afraid my friends would get yu if yu plugged me on th' sly, yu tried
 to make out that me an' Red rustled yore cayuses. That meant a lynching
 with me an' Red in th' places of honor. Yu never saw Red afore, but yu
 didn't care if he went with me. Yu don't deserve fair play, but I'm going
 to give it to yu because I don't want anybody to say that any of th'
 Bar-20 ever murdered a man, not even a skunk like yu. My friends have
 treated me too square for that. Yu can take this gun an yu can do one of
 three things with it, which are: walk out in th' open a hundred paces an'
 then turn an walk toward me?after you face me yu can set it a-going
 whenever yu want to; the second is, put it under yore hat an' I'll put
 mine an' th' others back by the cayuses. Then we'll toss up an' th' lucky
 man gets it to use as he wants. Th' third is, shoot yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy punctuated the close of his ultimatum by handing the weapon,
 muzzle first, and, because the other might be an adept at "twirling," he
 kept its recipient covered during the operation. Then, placing his second
 Colt's with the captured weapons, he threw them through the door, being
 very careful not to lose the drop on his now armed prisoner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes looked around and wiped the sweat from his forehead, and
 being an observant gentleman, took the proffered weapon and walked to the
 east, directly toward the sun, which at this time was halfway to the
 meridian. The glare of its straight rays and those reflected from the
 shining sand would, in a measure, bother Mr. Cassidy and interfere with
 the accuracy of his aim, and he was always thankful for small favors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes was the possessor of accurate knowledge regarding the lay of
 the land, and the thought came to him that there was a small but deep hole
 out toward the east and that it was about the required distance away. This
 had been dug by a man who had labored all day in the burning sun to make
 an oven so that he could cook mesquite root in the manner he had seen the
 Apaches cook it. Mr. Travennes blessed hobbies, specific and general,
 stumbled thoughtlessly and disappeared from sight as the surprised Mr.
 Cassidy started forward to offer his assistance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon emphatic notification from the man in the hole that his help was not
 needed, Mr. Cassidy wheeled around and in great haste covered the distance
 separating him from the hut, whereupon Mr. Travennes swore in
 self-congratulation and regret. Mr. Cassidy's shots barked a cactus which
 leaned near Mr. Travennes' head and flecked several clouds of alkali near
 that person's nose, causing him to sneeze, duck, and grin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's his own gun," grumbled Mr. Cassidy as a bullet passed through his
 sombrero, having in mind the fact that his opponent had a whole belt full
 of .44's. If it had been Mr. Cassidy's gun that had been handed over he
 would have enjoyed the joke on Mr. Travennes, who would have had five
 cartridges between himself and the promised eternity, as he would have
 been unable to use the .44's in Mr. Cassidy's .45, while the latter would
 have gladly consented to the change, having as he did an extra .45. Never
 before had Mr. Cassidy looked with reproach upon his .45 caliber Colt's,
 and he sighed as he used it to notify Mr. Travennes that arbitration was
 not to be considered, which that person indorsed, said indorsement passing
 so close to Mr. Cassidy's ear that he felt the breeze made by it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's been practicin' since I plugged him up in Santa Fe," thought Mr.
 Cassidy, as he retired around the hut to formulate a plan of campaign.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes sang "Hi-le, hi-lo," and other selections, principally
 others, and wondered how Mr. Cassidy could hoist him out. The slack of his
 belt informed him that he was in the middle of a fast, and suggested
 starvation as the derrick that his honorable and disgusted adversary might
 employ.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy, while figuring out his method of procedure, absent-mindedly
 jabbed a finger in his eye, and the ensuing tears floated an idea to him.
 He had always had great respect for ricochet shots since his friend Skinny
 Thompson had proved their worth on the hides of Sioux. If he could disturb
 the sand and convey several grains of it to Mr. Travennes' eyes the game
 would be much simplified. While planning for the proposed excavation, a la
 Colt's, he noticed several stones lying near at hand, and a new and better
 scheme presented itself for his consideration. If Mr. Travennes could be
 persuaded to get out of?well, it was worth trying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy lined up his gloomy collection and tersely ordered them to
 turn their backs to him and to stay in that position, the suggestion being
 that if they looked around they wouldn't be able to dodge quickly enough.
 He then slipped bits of his lariat over their wrists and ankles, tying
 wrists to ankles and each man to his neighbor. That finished to his
 satisfaction, he dragged them in the hut to save them from the burning
 rays of the sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Having performed this act of kindness, he crept along the hot sand, taking
 advantage of every bit of cover afforded, and at last he reached a point
 within a hundred feet of the besieged. During the trip Mr. Travennes sang
 to his heart's content, some of the words being improvised for the
 occasion and were not calculated to increase Mr. Cassidy's respect for his
 own wisdom if he should hear them. Mr. Cassidy heard, however, and several
 fragments so forcibly intruded on his peace of mind that he determined to
 put on the last verse himself and to suit himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly Mr. Travennes poked his head up and glanced at the hut. He was
 down again so quickly that there was no chance for a shot at him and he
 believed that his enemy was still sojourning in the rear of the building,
 which caused him to fear that he was expected to live on nothing as long
 as he could and then give himself up. Just to show his defiance he
 stretched himself out on his back and sang with all his might, his
 sombrero over his face to keep the glare of the sun out of his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was interrupted, however, forgot to finish a verse as he had intended,
 and jumped to one side as a stone bounced off his leg. Looking up, he saw
 another missile curve into his patch of sky and swiftly bear down on him.
 He avoided it by a hair's breadth and wondered what had happened. Then
 what Mr. Travennes thought was a balloon, being unsophisticated in matters
 pertaining to aerial navigation, swooped down upon him and smote him on
 the shoulder and also bounced off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes hastily laid music aside and took up elocution as he dodged
 another stone and wished that the mesquite-loving crank had put on a roof.
 In evading the projectile he let his sombrero appear on a level with the
 desert, and the hum of a bullet as it passed through his head-gear and
 into the opposite wall made him wish that there had been constructed a
 cellar, also.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi-le, hi-lo" intruded upon his ear, as Mr. Cassidy got rid of the
 surplus of his heart's joy. Another stone the size of a man's foot shaved
 Mr. Travennes' ear and he hugged the side of the hole nearest his enemy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hibernate, blank yu!" derisively shouted the human catapult as he
 released a chunk of sandstone the size of a quail. "Draw in yore laigs an'
 buck," was his God-speed to the missile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu!" indignantly yowled Mr. Travennes from his defective storm
 cellar. "Don't yu know any better'n to heave things thataway?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi-le, hi-lo," sang Mr. Cassidy, as another stone soared aloft in the
 direction of the complainant. Then he stood erect and awaited results with
 a Colt's in his hand leveled at the rim of the hole. A hat waved and an
 excited voice bit off chunks of expostulation and asked for an armistice.
 Then two hands shot up and Mr. Travennes, sore and disgusted and
 desperate, popped his head up an blinked at Mr. Cassidy's gun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu was fillin' th' hole up," remarked Mr. Travennes in an accusing tone,
 hiding the real reason for his evacuation. "In a little while I'd a been
 th' top of a pile instead of th' bottom of a hole," he announced, crawling
 out and rubbing his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy grinned and ordered his prisoner to one side while be secured
 the weapon which lay in the hole. Having obtained it as quickly as
 possible be slid it in his open shirt and clambered out again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu remind me of a feller I used to know," remarked Mr. Travennes, as he
 led the way to the hut, trying not to limp. "Only he throwed dynamite.
 That was th' way he cleared off chaparral?blowed it off. He got so
 used to heaving away everything he lit that he spoiled three pipes in two
 days."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy laughed at the fiction and then became grave as he pictured
 Mr. Connors sitting on the rock and facing down a line of men, any one of
 whom was capable of his destruction if given the interval of a second.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they arrived at the hut Mr. Cassidy observed that the prisoners had
 moved considerably. There was a cleanly swepttrail four yards long where
 they had dragged themselves, and they sat in the end nearer the guns. Mr.
 Cassidy smiled and fired close to the Mexican's ear, who lost in one
 frightened jump a little of what he had so laboriously gained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu'll wear out yore pants," said Mr. Cassidy, and then added grimly, "an'
 my patience."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Travennes smiled and thought of the man who so ably seconded Mr.
 Cassidy's efforts and who was probably shot by this time. The outfit of
 the Bar-20 was so well known throughout the land that he was aware the
 name of the other was Red Connors. An unreasoning streak of sarcasm swept
 over him and he could not resist the opportunity to get in a stab at his
 captor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mebby yore pard has wore out somebody's patience, too," said Mr.
 Travennes, suggestively and with venom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His captor wheeled toward him, his face white with passion, and Mr.
 Travennes shrank back and regretted the words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ain't shootin' dogs this here trip," said Mr. Cassidy, trembling with
 scorn and anger, "so yu can pull yourself together. I'll give yu another
 chance, but yu wants to hope almighty hard that Red is O. K. If he ain't,
 I'll blow yu so many ways at once that if yu sprouts yu'll make a good
 acre of weeds. If he is all right yu'd better vamoose this range, for
 there won't be no hole for yu to crawl into next time. What friends yu
 have left will have to tote yu off an' plant yu," he finished with
 emphasis. He drove the horses outside, and, after severing the bonds on
 his prisoners, lined them up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu," he began, indicating all but Mr. Travennes, "yu amble right smart
 toward Canada," pointing to the north. "Keep a-going till yu gets far
 enough away so a Colt won't find yu." Here he grinned with delight as he
 saw his Sharp's rifle in its sheath on his saddle and, drawing it forth,
 he put away his Colts and glanced at the trio, who were already
 industriously plodding northward. "Hey!" he shouted, and when they
 sullenly turned to see what new idea he had found he gleefully waved his
 rifle at them and warned them further: "This is a Sharp's an' it's good
 for half a mile, so don't stop none too soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Having sent them directly away from their friends so they could not have
 him "potted" on the way back, he mounted his broncho and indicated to Mr.
 Travennes that he, too, was to ride, watching that that person did not
 make use of the Winchester which Mr. Connors was foolish enough to carry
 around on his saddle. Winchesters were Mr. Cassidy's pet aversion and Mr.
 Connors' most prized possession, this difference of opinion having upon
 many occasions caused hasty words between them. Mr. Connors, being better
 with his Winchester than Mr. Cassidy was with his Sharp's, had frequently
 proved that his choice was the wiser, but Mr. Cassidy was loyal to the
 Sharp's and refused to be convinced. Now, however, the Winchester became
 pregnant with possibilities and, therefore, Mr. Travennes rode a few yards
 to the left and in advance, where the rifle was in plain sight, hanging as
 it did on the right of Mr. Connors' saddle, which Mr. Travennes graced so
 well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The journey back to town was made in good time and when they came to the
 buildings Mr. Cassidy dismounted and bade his companion do likewise, there
 being too many corners that a fleeing rider could take advantage of. Mr.
 Travennes felt of his bumps and did so, wishing hard things about Mr.
 Cassidy.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XV. The Penalty
 </h2>
 <p>
 While Mr. Travennes had been entertained in the manner narrated, Mr.
 Connors had passed the time by relating stale jokes to the uproarious
 laughter of his extremely bored audience, who had heard the aged efforts
 many times since they had first seen the light of day, and most of whom
 earnestly longed for a drink. The landlord, hearing the hilarity, had
 taken advantage of the opportunity offered to see a free show. Not being
 able to see what the occasion was for the mirth, he had pulled on his
 boots and made his way to the show with a flapjack in the skillets which,
 in his haste, he had forgotten to put down. He felt sure that he would be
 entertained, and he was not disappointed. He rounded the corner and was
 enthusiastically welcomed by the hungry Mr. Connors, whose ubiquitous guns
 coaxed from the skillet its dyspeptic wad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' saints be praised!" ejaculated Mr. Connors as a matter of form, not
 having a very clear idea of just what saints were, but he knew what
 flapjacks were and greedily overcame the heroic resistance of the one
 provided by chance and his own guns. As he rolled his eyes in ecstatic
 content the very man Mr. Cassidy had warned him against suddenly arose and
 in great haste disappeared around the corner of the corral, from which
 point of vantage he vented his displeasure at the treatment he had
 received by wasting six shots at the mortified Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Steady!" sang out that gentleman as the line-up wavered. "He's a
 precedent to hell for yu fellers! Don't yu get ambitious, none whatever."
 Then he wondered how long it would take the fugitive to secure a rifle and
 return to release the others by drilling him at long range.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His thoughts were interrupted by the vision of a red head that climbed
 into view over a rise a short distance off and he grinned his delight as
 Mr. Cassidy loomed up, jaunty and triumphant. Mr. Cassidy was executing
 calisthenics with a Colt in the rear of Mr. Travennes' neck and was
 leading the horses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors waved the skillet and his friend grinned his congratulations
 at what the token signified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see yu got some more," said Mr. Cassidy, as he went down the line-up
 from the rear and collected nineteen weapons of various makes and
 conditions, this number being explained by the fact that all but one of
 the prisoners wore two. Then he added the five that had kicked against his
 ribs ever since he had left the hut, and carefully threaded the end of his
 lariat through the trigger guards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looks like we stuck up a government supply mule, Red," he remarked, as he
 fastened the whole collection to his saddle. "Fourteen colts, six
 Merwin-Hulbert's, three Prescott, an' one puzzle," he added, examining the
 puzzle. "Made in Germany, it says, and it shore looks like it. It's got
 little pins stickin' out of th' cylinder, like you had to swat it with a
 hammer or a rock, or somethin' to make it go off. Must be damn dangerous,
 to most anybody around. Looks more like a cactus than a six-shooter-gosh,
 it's a ten-shooter! I allus said them Dutchmen was bloody-minded cusses.
 Think of bein' able to shoot yoreself ten times before th' blame thing
 stops!" Then looking at the line-up for the owner of the weapon, he
 laughed at the woeful countenances displayed. "Did they sidle in by
 companies or squads?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By twos, mostly. Then they parade-rested an' got discharged from duty. I
 had eleven, but one got homesick, or disgusted, or something, an'
 deserted. It was that cussed flapjack," confessed and explained Mr.
 Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" said Mr. Cassidy in a loud voice. "Got away! Well, we'll have to
 make our get-away plumb sudden or we'll never go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this instant the escaped man again began his bombardment from the
 corner of the corral and Mr. Cassidy paused, indignant at the fusillade
 which tore up the dust at his feet. He looked reproachfully at Mr. Connors
 and then circled out on the plain until he caught a glimpse of a fleeing
 cow-puncher, whose back rapidly grew smaller in the fast-increasing
 distance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's yore friend, Red," said Mr. Cassidy as he returned from his
 reconnaissance. "He's that short-horn yearling. Mebby he'll come back
 again," he added hopefully. "Anyhow, we've got to move. He'll collect
 reinforcements an' mebby they all won't shoot like him. Get up on yore
 Clarinda an' hold th' fort for me," he ordered, pushing the farther horse
 over to his friend. Mr. Connors proved that an agile man can mount a
 restless horse and not lose the drop, and backed off three hundred yards,
 deftly substituting his Winchester for the Colts. Then Mr. Cassidy
 likewise mounted with his attention riveted elsewhere and backed off to
 the side of his companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bombardment commenced again from the corral, but this time Mr.
 Connors' rifle slid around in his lap and exploded twice. The bellicose
 gentleman of the corral yelled in pain and surprise and vanished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Purty good for a Winchester," said Mr. Cassidy in doubtful
 congratulation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's why I got him," snapped Mr. Connors in brief reply, and then he
 laughed. "Is them th' vigilantes what never let a man get away?" He
 scornfully asked, backing down the street and patting his Winchester.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Red, they wasn't all there. They was only twelve all told," excused
 Mr. Cassidy. "An' then we was two," he explained, as he wished the
 collection of six-shooters was on Mr. Connors' horse so they wouldn't bark
 his shin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An we still are," corrected Mr. Connors, as they wheeled and galloped for
 Alkaline.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the sun sank low on the horizon Mr. Peters finished ordering provisions
 at the general store, the only one Alkaline boasted, and sauntered to the
 saloon where he had left his men. He found diem a few dollars richer, as
 they had borrowed ten dollars from the bartender on their reputations as
 poker players and had used the money to stake Mr. McAllister in a game
 against the local poker champion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has Hopalong an' Red showed up yet?" Asked Mr. Peters, frowning at the
 delay already caused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope," replied Johnny Nelson, as he paused from tormenting Billy
 Williams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that minute the doorway was darkened and Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Connors
 entered and called for refreshments. Mr. Cassidy dropped a huge bundle of
 six-shooters on the floor, making caustic remarks regarding their utility.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's th' matter?" Inquired Mr. Peters of Mr. Cassidy. "Yu looks mad an'
 anxious. An' where in blazes did yu corral them guns?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy drank deep and then reported with much heat what had occurred
 at Cactus Springs and added that he wanted to go back and wipe out the
 town, said desire being luridly endorsed by Mr. Connors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, shore," said Mr. Peters, "we'll all go. Such doings must be stopped
 instanter." Then he turned to the assembled outfits and asked for a vote,
 which was unanimous for war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shortly afterward eighteen angry cowpunchers rode to the east, two
 red-haired gentlemen well in front and urging speed. It was 8 P.M. when
 they left Alkaline, and the cool of the night was so delightful that the
 feeling of ease which came upon them made them lax and they lost three
 hours in straying from the dim trail. At eight o'clock the next morning
 they came in sight of their destination and separated into two squads, Mr.
 Cassidy leading the northern division and Mr. Connors the one which
 circled to the south. The intention was to attack from two directions,
 thus taking the town from front and rear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cactus Springs lay gasping in the excessive heat and the vigilantes who
 had toed Mr. Connors' line the day before were lounging in the shade of
 the "Palace" saloon, telling what they would do if they ever faced the
 same man again. Half a dozen sympathizers offered gratuitous condolence
 and advice and all were positive that they knew where Mr. Cassidy and Mr.
 Connors would go when they died.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The rolling thunder of madly pounding hoofs disturbed their post-mortem
 and they arose in a body to flee from half their number, who, guns in
 hands, charged down upon them through clouds of sickly white smoke.
 Travennes' Terrors were minus many weapons and they could not be expected
 to give a glorious account of themselves. Windows rattled and fell in and
 doors and walls gave off peculiar sounds as they grew full of holes. Above
 the riot rattled the incessant crack of Colt's and Winchester, emphasized
 at close intervals by the assertive roar of buffalo guns. Off to the south
 came another rumble of hoofs and Mr. Connors, leading the second squad,?arrived
 to participate in the payment of the debt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Smoke spurted from windows and other points of vantage and hung wavering
 in the heated air. The shattering of woodwork told of heavy slugs finding
 their rest, and the whines that grew and diminished in the air sang the
 course of .45s.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While the fight raged hottest Mr. Nelson sprang from his horse and ran to
 the "Palace," where he collected and piled a heap of tinder like wood, and
 soon the building burst out in flames, which, spreading, swept the town
 from end to end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy fired slowly and seemed to be waiting for something. Mr.
 Connors laid aside his hot Winchester and devoted his attention to his
 Colts. A spurt of flame and smoke leaped from the window of a 'dobe hut
 and Mr. Connors sat down, firing as he went. A howl from the window
 informed him that he had made a hit, and Mr. Cassidy ran out and dragged
 him to the shelter of a near-by bowlder and asked how much he was hurt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not much?in the calf," grunted Mr. Connors. "He was a bad shot?must
 have been the cuss that got away yesterday," speculated the injured man as
 he slowly arose to his feet. Mr. Cassidy dissented from force of habit and
 returned to his station. Mr. Travennes, who was sleeping late that
 morning, coughed and fought for air in his sleep, awakened in smoke,
 rubbed his eyes to make sure and, scorning trousers and shirt, ran clad in
 his red woolen undergarments to the corral, where he mounted his scared
 horse and rode for the desert and safety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy, swearing at the marksmanship of a man who fired at his head
 and perforated his sombrero, saw a crimson rider sweep down upon him, said
 rider being heralded by a blazing .44.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gosh!" ejaculated Mr. Cassidy, scarcely believing his eyes. "Oh, it's my
 friend Slim going to hades," he remarked to himself in audible and
 relieved explanation. Mr. Cassidy's Colts cracked a protest and then he
 joined Mr. Peters and the others and with them fought his way out of the
 flame-swept town of Cactus Springs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An hour later Mr. Connors glanced behind him at the smoke silhouetted on
 the horizon and pushed his way to where Mr. Cassidy rode in silence. Mr.
 Connors grinned at his friend of the red hair, who responded in the same
 manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu see Slim?" Casually inquired Mr. Connors, looking off to the
 south.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Cassidy sat upright in his saddle and felt of his Colts. "Yes," he
 replied, "I saw him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Connors thereupon galloped on in silence.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVI. Rustlers on the Range
 </h2>
 <p>
 The affair at Cactus Springs had more effect on the life at the Bar-20
 than was realized by the foreman. News travels rapidly, and certain men,
 whose attributes were not of the sweetest, heard of it and swore
 vengeance, for Slim Travennes had many friends, and the result of his
 passing began to show itself. Outlaws have as their strongest defense the
 fear which they inspire, and little time was lost in making reprisals, and
 these caused Buck Peters to ride into Buckskin one bright October morning
 and then out the other side of the town. Coming to himself with a start he
 looked around shamefacedly and retraced his course. He was very much
 troubled, for, as foreman of the Bar-20, he had many responsibilities, and
 when things ceased to go aright he was expected not only to find the cause
 of the evil, but also the remedy. That was what he was paid seventy
 dollars a month for and that was what he had been endeavoring to do. As
 yet, however, he had only accomplished what the meanest cook's assistant
 had done. He knew the cause of his present woes to be rustlers (cattle
 thieves), and that was all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Riding down the wide, quiet street, he stopped and dismounted before the
 ever-open door of a ramshackle, one-story frame building. Tossing the
 reins over the flattened ears of his vicious pinto he strode into the
 building and leaned easily against the bar, where he drummed with his
 fingers and sank into a reverie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A shining bald pate, bowed over an open box, turned around and revealed a
 florid face, set with two small, twinkling blue eyes, as the proprietor,
 wiping his hands on his trousers, made his way to Buck's end of the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin', Buck. How's things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman, lost in his reverie, continued to stare out the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mornin'," repeated the man behind the bar. "How's things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" ejaculated the foreman, smiling, "purty cussed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything flew?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' C-80 lost another herd last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His companion swore and placed a bottle at the foreman's elbow, but the
 latter shook his head. "Not this mornin'?I'll try one of them vile
 cigars, however."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Them cigars are th' very best that?" began the proprietor,
 executing the order.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, heck!" exclaimed Buck with weary disgust. "Yu don't have to palaver
 none: I shore knows all that by heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Them cigars?" repeated the proprietor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yas, yas; them cigars?I know all about them cigars. Yu gets them
 for twenty dollars a thousand an' hypnotizes us into payin' yu a hundred,"
 replied the foreman, biting off the end 'of his weed. Then he stared
 moodily and frowned. "I wonder why it is?" He asked. "We punchers like
 good stuff an' we pays good prices with good money. What do we get? Why,
 cabbage leaves an' leather for our smokin' an' alcohol an' extract for our
 drink. Now, up in Kansas City we goes to a sumptious layout, pays less an'
 gets bang-up stuff. If yu smelled one of them K. C. cigars yu'd shore have
 to ask what it was, an' as for the liquor, why, yu'd think St. Peter asked
 yu to have one with him. It's shore wrong somewhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They have more trade in K. C.," suggested the proprietor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' help, an' taxes, an' a license, an' rent, an' brass, cut glass,
 mahogany an' French mirrors," countered the foreman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They have more trade," reiterated the man with the cigars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forty men spend thirty dollars apiece with yu every month." The
 proprietor busied himself under the bar. "Yu'll feel better to-morrow.
 Anyway, what do yu care, yu won't lose yore job," he said, emerging.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck looked at him and frowned, holding back the words which formed in
 anger. What was the use, he thought, when every man judged the world in
 his own way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have yu seen any of th' boys?" He asked, smiling again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nary a boy. Who do yu reckon's doin' all this rustlin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm reckonin', not shoutin'," responded the foreman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The proprietor looked out the window and grinned: "Here comes one of yourn
 now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The newcomer stopped his horse in a cloud of dust, playfully kicked the
 animal in the ribs and entered, dusting the alkali from him with a huge
 sombrero. Then he straightened up and sniffed: "What's burnin'?" he asked,
 simulating alarm. Then he noticed the cigar between the teeth of his
 foreman and grinned: "Gee, but yore a brave man, Buck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hullo, Hopalong," said the foreman. "Want a smoke?" Waving his hand
 toward the box on the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Hopalong Cassidy side-stepped and began to roll a cigarette: "Shore,
 but I'll burn my own?I know what it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was yu doin' to my cayuse afore yu come in?" Asked Buck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothin'," replied the newcomer. "That was mine what I kicked in th'
 corrugations."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is it yore ridin' the calico?" Asked the foreman. "I thought yu was
 dead stuck on that piebald."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That piebald's a goat; he's beein livin' off my pants lately," responded
 Hopalong. "Every time I looks th' other way he ambles over and takes a
 bite at me. Yu just wait 'til this rustler business is roped, an' branded,
 an' yu'll see me eddicate that blessed scrapheap into eatin' grass again."
 He swiped Billy's shirt th' other day?took it right off th' corral
 wall, where Billy's left it to dry. Then, seeing Buck raise his eyebrows,
 he explained: "Shore, he washed it again. That makes three times since
 last fall."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The proprietor laughed and pushed out the ever-ready bottle, but Hopalong
 shoved it aside and told the reason: "Ever since I was up to K. C. I've
 been spoiled. I'm drinkin' water an' slush."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For Pete's sake, has any more of yu fellers been up to K. C.?" queried
 the proprietor in alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore: Red an' Billy was up there, too." responded Hopalong. "Red's got a
 few remarks to shout to yu about yore pain-killer. Yu better send for some
 decent stuff afore he comes to town," he warned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck swung away from the bar and looked at his dead cigar. Then he turned
 to Hopalong. "What did you find?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Same old story: nice wide trail up to th' Staked Plain?then
 nothin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore beats me," soliloquized the foreman. "It shore beats me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Think it was Tamale Jose's old gang?" Asked Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it was they took th' wrong trail home?that ain't th' way to
 Mexico."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong tossed aside his half-smoked cigarette. "Well, come on home;
 what's th' use stewin' over it? It'll come out all O.K. in th' wash." Then
 he laughed: "There won't be no piebald waitin' for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Evading Buck's playful blow he led the way to the door, and soon they were
 a cloud of dust on the plain. The proprietor, despairing of customers
 under the circumstances, absent-mindedly wiped oil on the bar, and sought
 his chair for a nap, grumbling about the way his trade had fallen off, for
 there were few customers, and those who did call were heavy with loss of
 sleep, and with anxiety, and only paused long enough to toss off their
 drink. On the ranges there were occurrences which tried men's souls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For several weeks cattle had been disappearing from the ranges and the
 losses had long since passed the magnitude of those suffered when Tamale
 Jose and his men had crossed the Rio Grande and repeatedly levied heavy
 toll on the sleek herds of the Pecos Valley. Tamale Jose had raided once
 too often, and prosperity and plenty had followed on the ranches and the
 losses had been forgotten until the fall round-ups clearly showed that
 rustlers were again at work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Despite the ingenuity of the ranch owners and the unceasing vigilance and
 night rides of the cow-punchers, the losses steadily increased until there
 was promised a shortage which would permit no drive to the western
 terminals of the railroad that year. For two weeks the banks of the Rio
 Grande had been patrolled and sharp-eyed men searched daily for trails
 leading southward, for it was not strange to think that the old raiders
 were again at work, notwithstanding the fact that they had paid dearly for
 their former depredations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The patrols failed to discover anything out of the ordinary and the
 searchers found no trails. Then it was that the owners and foremen of the
 four central ranches met in Cowan's saloon and sat closeted together for
 all of one hot afternoon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The conference resulted in riders being dispatched from all the ranches
 represented, and one of the couriers, Mr. Red Connors, rode north, his
 destination being far-away Montana. All the ranches within a radius of a
 hundred miles received letters and blanks and one week later the Pecos
 Valley Cattle-Thief Elimination Association was organized and working,
 with Buck as Chief Ranger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the outcomes of Buck's appointment was a sudden and marked
 immigration into the affected territory. Mr. Connors returned from Montana
 with Mr. Frenchy McAllister, the foreman of the Tin-Cup, who was
 accompanied by six of his best and most trusted men. Mr. McAllister and
 party were followed by Mr. You-bet Somes, foreman of the Two-X-Two of
 Arizona, and five of his punchers, and later on the same day Mr. Pie
 Willis, accompanied by Mr. Billy Jordan and his two brothers, arrived from
 the Panhandle. The O-Bar-O, situated close to the town of Muddy Wells,
 increased its payroll by the addition of nine men, each of whom bore the
 written recommendation of the foreman of the Bar-20. The C-80, Double
 Arrow and the Three Triangle also received heavy reinforcements, and even
 Carter, owner of the Barred Horseshoe, far removed from the zone of the
 depredations, increased his outfits by half their regular strength.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck believed that if a thing was worth doing at all that it was worth
 doing very well, and his acquaintances were numerous and loyal. The
 collection of individuals that responded to the call were noteworthy
 examples of "gun-play" and their aggregate value was at par with twice
 their numbers in cavalry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each ranch had one large ranch-house and numerous line-houses scattered
 along the boundaries. These latter, while intended as camps for the
 outriders, had been erected in the days, none too remote, when Apaches,
 Arrapahoes, and even Cheyennes raided southward, and they had been
 constructed with the idea of defense paramount. Upon more than one
 occasion a solitary line-rider had retreated within their adobe walls and
 had successfully resisted all the cunning and ferocity of a score of
 paint-bedaubed warriors and, when his outfit had rescued him, emerged none
 the worse for his ordeal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Bar-20, Buck placed these houses in condition to withstand seige.
 Twin barrels of water stood in opposite corners, provisions were stored on
 the hanging shelves and the bunks once again reveled in untidiness. Spare
 rifles, in pattern ranging from long-range Sharp's and buffalo guns to
 repeating rifles, leaned against the walls, and unbroken boxes of
 cartridges were piled above the bunks. Instead of the lonesome outrider,
 he placed four men to each house, two of whom were to remain at home and
 hold the house while their companions rode side by side on their
 multi-mile beat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were six of these houses and, instead of returning each night to the
 same line-house, the outriders kept on and made the circuit, thus keeping
 every one well informed and breaking the monotony. These measures were
 expected to cause the rustling operations to cease at once, but the effect
 was to shift the losses to the Double Arrow, the line-houses of which
 boasted only one puncher each. Unreasonable economy usually defeats its
 object.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Double Arrow was restricted on the north by the Staked Plain, which in
 itself was considered a superb defense. The White Sand Hills formed its
 eastern boundary and were thought to be second only to the northern
 protection. The only reason that could be given for the hitherto
 comparative immunity from the attacks of the rustlers was that its cattle
 clung to the southern confines where there were numerous springs, thus
 making imperative the crossing of its territory to gain the herds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was in line-house No. 3, most remote of all, that Johnny Redmond fought
 his last fight and was found face down in the half ruined house with a
 hole in the back of his head, which proved that one man was incapable of
 watching all the loop holes in four walls at once. There must have been
 some casualties on the other side, for Johnny was reputed to be very
 painstaking in his "gunplay," and the empty shells which lay scattered on
 the floor did not stand for as many ciphers, of that his foreman was
 positive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was buried the day he was found, and the news of his death ran quickly
 from ranch to ranch and made more than one careless puncher arise and pace
 the floor in anger. More men came to the Double Arrow and its sentries
 were doubled. The depredations continued, however, and one night a week
 later Frank Swift reeled into the ranch-house and fell exhausted across
 the supper table. Rolling hoof-beats echoed flatly and died away on the
 plain, but the men who pursued them returned empty handed. The wounds of
 the unfortunate were roughly dressed and in his delirium he recounted the
 fight. His companion was found literally shot to pieces twenty paces from
 the door. One wall was found blown in, and this episode, when coupled with
 the use of dynamite, was more than could be tolerated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Buck had been informed of this he called to him Hopalong Cassidy, Red
 Connors and Frenchy McAllister, and the next day the three men rode north
 and the contingents of the ranches represented in the Association were
 divided into two squads, one of which was to remain at home and guard the
 ranches; the other, to sleep fully dressed and armed and never to stray
 far from their ranch-houses and horses. These latter would be called upon
 to ride swiftly and far when the word came.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVII. Mr. Trendley Assumes Added Importance
 </h2>
 <p>
 That the rustlers were working under a well organized system was evident.
 That they were directed by a master of the game was ceaselessly beaten
 into the consciousness of the Association by the diversity, dash and
 success of their raids. No one, save the three men whom they had
 destroyed, had ever seen them. But, like Tamale Jose, they had raided once
 too often.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trendley, more familiarly known to men as "Slippery," was the
 possessor of a biased conscience, if any at all. Tall, gaunt and
 weather-beaten and with coal-black eyes set deep beneath hairless
 eyebrows, he was sinister and forbidding. Into his forty-five years of
 existence he had crowded a century of experience, and unsavory rumors
 about him existed in all parts of the great West. From Canada to Mexico
 and from Sacramento to Westport his name stood for brigandage. His
 operations had been conducted with such consummate cleverness that in all
 the accusations there was lacking proof.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Only once had he erred, and then in the spirit of pure deviltry and in the
 days of youthful folly, and his mistake was a written note. He was even
 thought by some to have been concerned in the Mountain Meadow Massacre;
 others thought him to have been the leader of the band of outlaws that had
 plundered along the Santa Fe Trail in the late '60's. In Montana and
 Wyoming he was held responsible for the outrages of the band that had
 descended from the Hole-in-the-Wall territory and for over a hundred miles
 carried murder and theft that shamed as being weak the most assiduous
 efforts of zealous Cheyennes. It was in this last raid that he had made
 the mistake and it was in this raid that Frenchy McAllister had lost his
 wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Frenchy had first been approached by Buck as to his going in search
 of the rustlers he had asked to go alone. This had been denied by the
 foreman of the Bar-20 because the men whom he had selected to accompany
 the scout were of such caliber that their presence could not possibly form
 a hindrance. Besides being his most trusted friends they were regarded by
 him as being the two best exponents of "gun-play" that the West afforded.
 Each was a specialist: Hopalong, expert beyond belief with his Colt's
 six-shooters, was only approached by Red, whose Winchester was renowned
 for its accuracy. The three made a perfect combination, as the rashness of
 the two younger men would be under the controlling influence of a man who
 could retain his coolness of mind under all circumstances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Buck and Frenchy looked into each other's eyes there sprang into the
 mind of each the same name?Slippery Trendley. Both had spent the
 greater part of a year in fruitless search for that person, the foreman of
 the Tin-Cup in vengeance for the murder of his wife, the blasting of his
 prospects and the loss of his herds; Buck, out of sympathy for his friend
 and also because they had been partners in the Double Y. Now that the
 years had passed and the long-sought-for opportunity was believed to be at
 hand, there was promised either a cessation of the outrages or that Buck
 would never again see his friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the three mounted and came to him for final instructions Buck forced
 himself to be almost repellent in order to be capable of coherent speech.
 Hopalong glanced sharply at him and then understood, Red was all attention
 and eagerness and remarked nothing but the words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have yu ever heard of Slippery Trendley?" Harshly inquired the foreman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They nodded, and on the faces of the younger men a glint of hatred showed
 itself, but Frenchy wore his poker countenance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck continued: "Th' reason I asked yu was because I don't want yu to
 think yore goin' on no picnic. I ain't shore it's him, but I've had some
 hopeful information. Besides, he is th' only man I knows of who's capable
 of th' plays that have been made. It's hardly necessary for me to tell yu
 to sleep with one eye open and never to get away from yore guns. Now I'm
 goin' to tell yu th' hardest part: yu are goin' to search th' Staked Plain
 from one end to th' other, an' that's what no white man's ever done to my
 knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, listen to this an' don't forget it. Twenty miles north from Last
 Stand Rock is a spring; ten miles south of that bend in Hell Arroyo is
 another. If yu gets lost within two days from th' time yu enters th'
 Plain, put yore left hand on a cactus sometime between sun-up an' noon,
 move around until yu are over its shadow an' then ride straight ahead?that's
 south. If you goes loco beyond Last Stand Rock, follow th' shadows made
 before noon?that's th' quickest way to th' Pecos. Yu all knows what
 to do in a sand-storm, so I won't bore you with that. Repeat all I've told
 yu," he ordered and they complied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm tellin' yu this," continued the foreman, indicating the two
 auxiliaries, "because yu might get separated from Frenchy. Now I suggests
 that yu look around near the' Devils Rocks: I've heard that there are
 several water holes among them, an' besides, they might be turned into
 fair corrals. Mind yu, I know what I've said sounds damned idiotic for
 anybody that has had as much experience with th' Staked Plain as I have,
 but I've had every other place searched for miles around. Th' men of all
 th' ranches have been scoutin' an' th' Plain is th' only place left. Them
 rustlers has got to be found if we have to dig to hell for them. They've
 taken th' pot so many times that they reckons they owns it, an' we've got
 to at least make a bluff at drawin' cards. Mebby they're at th' bottom of
 th' Pecos," here he smiled faintly, "but wherever they are, we've got to
 find them. I want to holler 'Keno."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you finds where they hangs out come away instanter," here his face
 hardened and his eyes narrowed, "for it'll take more than yu three to deal
 with them th' way I'm a-hankerin' for. Come right back to th' Double
 Arrow, send me word by one of their punchers an' get all the rest you can
 afore I gets there. It'll take me a day to get th' men together an' to
 reach yu. I'm goin' to use smoke signals to call th' other ranches, so
 there won't be no time lost. Carry all th' water yu can pack when yu
 leaves th' Double Arrow an' don't depend none on cactus juice. Yu better
 take a pack horse to carry it, an' yore grub?yu can shoot it if yu
 have to hit th' trail real hard."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The three riders felt of their accouterments, said "So long," and cantered
 off for the pack horse and extra ammunition. Then they rode toward the
 Double Arrow, stopping at Cowan's long enough to spend some money, and
 reached the Double Arrow at nightfall. Early the next morning they passed
 the last line-house and, with the profane well-wishes of its occupants
 ringing in their ears, passed onto one of Nature's worst blunders?the
 Staked Plain.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVIII. The Search Begins
 </h2>
 <p>
 As the sun arose it revealed three punchers riding away from civilization.
 On all sides, stretching to the evil-appearing horizon, lay vast blotches
 of dirty-white and faded yellow alkali and sand. Occasionally a dwarfed
 mesquite raised its prickly leaves and rustled mournfully. With the
 exception of the riders and an occasional Gila monster, no life was
 discernible. Cacti of all shapes and sizes reared aloft their forbidding
 spines or spread out along the sand. All was dead, ghastly; all was
 oppressive, startlingly repellent in its sinister promise; all was the
 vastness of desolation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong knew this portion of the desert for ten miles inward?he had
 rescued straying cattle along its southern rim?but once beyond that
 limit they would have to trust to chance and their own abilities. There
 were water holes on this skillet, but nine out of ten were death traps,
 reeking with mineral poisons, colored and alkaline. The two mentioned by
 Buck could not be depended on, for they came and went, and more than one
 luckless wanderer had depended on them to allay his thirst, and had died
 for his trust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the scouts rode on in silence, noting the half-buried skeletons of
 cattle which were strewn plentifully on all sides. Nearly three per cent,
 of the cattle belonging to the Double Arrow yearly found death on this
 tableland, and the herds of that ranch numbered many thousand heads. It
 was this which made the Double Arrow the poorest of the ranches, and it
 was this which allowed insufficient sentries in its line-houses. The
 skeletons were not all of cattle, for at rare intervals lay the sand-worn
 frames of men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the morning of the second day the oppression increased with the wind
 and Red heaved a sigh of restlessness. The sand began to skip across the
 plain, in grains at first and hardly noticeable. Hopalong turned in his
 saddle and regarded the desert with apprehension. As he looked he saw that
 where grains had shifted handfuls were now moving. His mount evinced signs
 of uneasiness and was hard to control.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A gust of wind, stronger than the others, pricked his face and grains of
 sand rolled down his neck. The leather of his saddle emitted strange
 noises as if a fairy tattoo was being beaten upon it and he raised his
 hand and pointed off toward the east. The others looked and saw what had
 appeared to be a fog rise out of the desert and intervene between them and
 the sun. As far as eye could reach small whirlwinds formed and broke and
 one swept down and covered them with stinging sand. The day became
 darkened and their horses whinnied in terror and the clumps of mesquite
 twisted and turned to the gusts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each man knew what was to come upon them and they dismounted, hobbled
 their horses and threw them bodily to the earth, wrapping a blanket around
 the head of each. A rustling as of paper rubbing together became
 noticeable and they threw themselves flat upon the earth, their heads
 wrapped in their coats and buried in the necks of their mounts. For an
 hour they endured the tortures of hell and then, when the storm had
 passed, raised their heads and cursed Creation. Their bodies burned as
 though they had been shot with fine needles and their clothes were meshes
 where once was tough cloth. Even their shoes were perforated and the
 throat of each ached with thirst.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong fumbled at the canteen resting on his hip and gargled his mouth
 and throat, washing down the sand which wouldn't come up. His friends did
 likewise and then looked around. After some time had elapsed the loss of
 their pack horse was noticed and they swore again. Hopalong took the lead
 in getting his horse ready for service and then rode around in a circle
 half a mile in diameter, but returned empty handed. The horse was gone and
 with it went their main supply of food and drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy scowled at the shadow of a cactus and slowly rode toward the
 northeast, followed closely by his friends. His hand reached for his
 depleted canteen, but refrained?water was to be saved until the last
 minute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm goin' to build a shack out here an' live in it, I am!" exploded
 Hopalong in withering irony as he dug the sand out of his ears and also
 from his sixshooter. "I just nachurally dotes on this, I do!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others were too miserable to even grunt and he neatly severed the head
 of a Gila monster from its scaly body as it opened it venomous jaws in
 rage at this invasion of its territory. "Lovely place!" he sneered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You better save them cartridges, Hoppy," interposed Red as his companion
 fired again, feeling that he must say something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' what for?" blazed his friend. "To plug sand storms? Anybody what we
 find on this God-forsaken lay-out won't have to be shot?they will
 commit suicide an' think it's fun! Tell yu what, if them rustlers hangs
 out on this sand range they're better men than I reckons they are. Anybody
 what hides up here shore earns all he steals." Hopalong grumbled from
 force of habit and because no one else would. His companions understood
 this and paid no attention to him, which increased his disgust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are we up here for?" He asked, belligerently. "Why, because them
 Double Arrow idiots can't even watch a desert! We have to do their work
 for them an' they hangs around home an' gets slaughtered! Yes, sir!" he
 shouted, "they can't even take care of themselves when they're in
 line-houses what are forts. Why, that time we cleaned out them an' th'
 C-80 over at Buckskin they couldn't help runnin' into singin' lead!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," drawled Red, whose recollection of that fight was vivid. "Yas, an'
 why?" He asked, and then replied to his own question. "Because yu sat up
 in a barn behind them, Buck played his gun on th' side window, Pete an'
 Skinny lay behind a rock to one side of Buck, me an' Lanky was across th'
 Street in front of them, an' Billy an' Johnny was in th' arroyo on th'
 other side. Cowan laid on his stummick on th' roof of his place with a
 buffalo gun, an' the whole blamed town was agin them. There wasn't five
 seconds passed that lead wasn't rippin' through th' walls of their shack.
 Th' Houston House wasn't made for no fort, an' besides, they wasn't like
 th' gang that's punchin' now. That's why."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong became cheerful again, for here was a chance to differ from his
 friend. The two loved each other the better the more they squabbled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yas!" responded Hopalong with sarcasm. "Yas!" he reiterated, drawling it
 out. "Yu was in front of them, an' with what? Why, an' old, white-haired,
 interfering Winchester, that's what! Me an' my Sharp's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu and yore Sharp's!" exploded Red, whose dislike for that rifle was very
 pronounced. "Yu and yore Sharp's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me an' my Sharp's, as I was palaverin' before bein' interrupted,"
 continued Hopalong, "did more damage in five min?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Says yu!" snapped Red with heat. "All yu an yore Sharp's could do was to
 cut yore initials in th' back door of their shack, an'??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did more damage in five minutes," continued Hopalong, "than all th'
 blasted Winchesters in th' whole damned town. Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' then they was cut blamed poor. Every time that cannon of yourn
 exploded I shore thought th'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Cowan an' his buffalo did more damage (Cowan was reputed to be a
 very poor shot) than yu an?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought th' artillery was comin' into th' disturbance. I could see yore
 red head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "MY red head!" exclaimed Hopalong, sizing up the crimson warlock of his
 companion. "MY red head!" he repeated, and then turned to Frenchy: "Hey,
 Frenchy, who's got th' reddest hair, me or Red?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy slowly turned in his saddle and gravely scrutinized them. Being
 strictly impartial and truthful, he gave up the effort of differentiating
 and smiled. "Why, if the tops of yore heads were poked through two holes
 in a board an' I didn't know which was which, I'd shore make a mistake if
 I tried to name 'em"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Red had the last word. "Anyhow, you didn't have a Sharp's in that
 fight?you had a .45-70 Winchester, just like mine!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thereupon the discussion was directed at the judge, and the forenoon
 passed very pleasantly, Frenchy even smiling in his misery.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIX. Hopalong's Decision
 </h2>
 <p>
 Shortly after noon, Hopalong, who had ridden with his head bowed low in
 meditation, looked up and slapped his thigh. Then he looked at Red and
 grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look ahere, Red," he began, "there ain't no rustlers with their
 headquarters on this God-forsaken sand heap, an' there never was. They
 have to have water an' lots of it, too, an' th' nearest of any account is
 th' Pecos, or some of them streams over in th' Panhandle. Th' Panhandle is
 th' best place. There are lots of streams an' lakes over there an' they're
 right in a good grass country. Why, an' army could hide over there an'
 never be found unless it was hunted for blamed good. Then, again, it's
 close to the railroad. Up north aways is th' south branch of th' Santa Fe
 Trail an' it's far enough away not to bother anybody in th' middle
 Panhandle. Then there's Fort Worth purty near, an' other trails. Didn't
 Buck say he had all th' rest of th' country searched? He meant th' Pecos
 Valley an th' Davis Mountains country. All th' rustlers would have to do
 if they were in th' Panhandle would be to cross th' Canadian an th'
 Cimarron an' hit th' trail for th' railroad. Good fords, good grass an'
 water all th' way, cattle fat when they are delivered an plenty of room.
 Th' more I thinks about it th' more I cottons to the Panhandle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it shore does sound good," replied Red, reflectively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do yu mean th' Cunningham Lake region or farther north?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just th' other side of this blasted desert: anywhere where there's
 water," responded Hopalong, enthusiastically. "I've been doin' some hot
 reckonin' for th' last two hours an' this is th' way it looks to me: they
 drives th' cows up on this skillet for a ways, then turns east an' hits
 th' trail for home an' water. They can get around th' ca on near
 Thatcher's Lake by a swing of th' north. I tell yu that's th' only way
 out'n this. Who could tell where they turned with th' wind raisin' th'
 deuce with the trail? Didn't we follow a trail for a ways, an' then what?
 Why, there wasn't none to follow. We can ride north 'till we walk behind
 ourselves an' never get a peek at them. I am in favor of headin' for th'
 Sulphur Spring Creek district. We can spend a couple of weeks, if we has
 to, an' prospect that whole region without havin' to cut our' water down
 to a smell an' a taste an live on jerked beef. If we investigates that
 country we'll find something else than sand storms, poisoned water holes
 an' blisters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't th' Panhandle full of nesters (farmers)?" Inquired Red, doubtfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Along th' Canadian an' th' edges, yas; in th' middle, no," explained
 Hopalong. "They hang close together on account of th' war-whoops, an' they
 like th' trails purty well because of there allus bein' somebody passin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buck ought to send some of th' Panhandle boys up there," suggested Red.
 "There's Pie Willis an' th' Jordans?they knows th' Panhandle like yu
 knows poker."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy had paid no apparent attention to the conversation up to this
 point, but now he declared himself. "Yu heard what Buck said, didn't yu?"
 He asked. "We were told to search th' Staked Plains from one end to th'
 other an' I'm goin' to do it if I can hold out long enough. I ain't goin'
 to palaver with yu because what yu say can't be denied as far as wisdom is
 concerned. Yu may have hit it plumb center, but I knows what I was ordered
 to do, an' yu can't get me to go over there if you shouts all night. When
 Buck says anything, she goes. He wants to know where th' cards are stacked
 an' why he can't holler 'Keno,' an' I'm goin' to find out if I can. Yu can
 go to Patagonia if yu wants to, but yu go alone as far as I am concerned."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's better if yu don't go with us," replied Hopalong, taking it
 for granted that Red would accompany him. "Yu can prospect this end of th'
 game an' we'll be takin' care of th' other. It's two chances now where we
 only had one afore."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu go east an' I'll hunt around as ordered," responded Frenchy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "East nothin'," replied Hopalong. "Yu don't get me to wallow in hot alkali
 an' lose time ridin' in ankle-deep sand when I can hit th' south trail,
 skirt th' White Sand Hills an' be in God's country again. I ain't goin' to
 wrastle with no ca on this here trip, none whatever. I'm goin' to travel
 in style, get to Big Spring by ridin' two miles to where I could only make
 one on this stove. Then I'll head north along Sulpher Spring Creek an'
 have water an' grass all th' way, barrin' a few stretches. While you are
 bein' fricasseed I'll be streakin' through cottonwood groves an' ridin' in
 the creek."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu'll have to go alone, then," said Red, resolutely. "Frenchy ain't
 a-goin' to die of lonesomeness on this desert if I knows what I'm about,
 an' I reckon I do, some. Me an' him'll follow out what Buck said, hunt
 around for a while an' then Frenchy can go back to th' ranch to tell Buck
 what's up an' I'll take th' trail yu are a-scared of an' meet yu at th'
 east end of Cunningham Lake three days from now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu better come with me," coaxed Hopalong, not liking what his friend had
 said about being afraid of the trail past the ca on and wishing to have
 some one with whom to talk on his trip. "I'm goin' to have a nice long
 swim to-morrow night," he added, trying bribery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' I'm goin' to try to keep from hittin' my blisters," responded Red. "I
 don't want to go swimmin' in no creek full of moccasins?I'd rather
 sleep with rattlers or copperheads. Every time I sees a cotton-mouth I
 feels like I had just sit down on one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll flip a coin to see whether yu comes or not," proposed Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If yu wants to gamble so bad I'll flip yu to see who draws our pay next
 month, but not for what you said," responded Red, choking down the desire
 to try his luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong grinned and turned toward the south. "If I sees Buck afore yu do,
 I'll tell him yu an' Frenchy are growin' watermelons up near Last Stand
 Rock an' are waitin' for rain. Well, so long," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu tell Buck we're obeyin' orders!" shouted Red, sorry that he was not
 going with his bunkie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy and Red rode on in silence, the latter feeling strangely lonesome,
 for he and the departed man had seldom been separated when journeys like
 this were to be taken. And when in search of pleasure they were nearly
 always together. Frenchy, while being very friendly with Hopalong, a
 friendship that would have placed them side by side against any odds, was
 not accustomed to his company and did not notice his absence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red looked off toward the south for the tenth time and for the tenth time
 thought that his friend might return. "He's a son-of-a-gun," he
 soliloquized.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His companion looked up: "He shore is, an' he's right about this rustler
 business, too. But we'll look around for a day or so an' then yu raise
 dust for th' Lake. I'll go back to th' ranch an' get things primed, so
 there'll be no time lost when we get th' word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry I went an' said what I did about me takin' th' trail he was
 a-scared of," confessed Red, after a pause. "Why, he ain't a-scared of
 nothin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He got back at yu about them watermelons, so what's th' difference?"
 Asked Frenchy. "He don't owe yu nothin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An hour later they searched the Devil's Rocks, but found no rustlers.
 Filling their canteens at a tiny spring and allowing their mounts to drink
 the remainder of the water, they turned toward Hell Arroyo, which they
 reached at nightfall. Here, also, their search availed them nothing and
 they paused in indecision. Then Frenchy turned toward his companion and
 advised him to ride toward the Lake in the night when it was comparatively
 cool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red considered and then decided that the advice was good. He rolled a
 cigarette, wheeled and faced the east and spurred forward: "So long," he
 called.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long," replied Frenchy, who turned toward the south and departed for
 the ranch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman of the Bar-20 was cleaning his rifle when he heard the
 hoof-beats of a galloping horse and he ran around the corner of the house
 to meet the newcomer, whom he thought to be a courier from the Double
 Arrow. Frenchy dismounted and explained why he returned alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck listened to the report and then, noting the fire which gleamed in his
 friend's eyes, nodded his approval to the course. "I reckon it's Trendley,
 Frenchy?I've heard a few things since yu left. An' yu can bet that
 if Hopalong an' Red have gone for him he'll be found. I expect action any
 time now, so we'll light th' signal fire." Then he hesitated; "Yu light it?yu've
 been waiting a long time for this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The balls of smoke which rolled upward were replied to by other balls at
 different points on the plain, and the Bar-20 prepared to feed the numbers
 of hungry punchers who would arrive within the next twenty-four hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two hours had not passed when eleven men rode up from the Three Triangle,
 followed eight hours later by ten from the O-Bar-O. The outfits of the
 Star Circle and the Barred Horseshoe, eighteen in all, came next and had
 scarcely dismounted when those of the C-80 and the Double Arrow, fretting
 at the delay, rode up. With the sixteen from the Bar-20 the force numbered
 seventy-five resolute and pugnacious cowpunchers, all aching to wipe out
 the indignities suffered.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XX. A Problem Solved
 </h2>
 <p>
 Hopalong worried his way out of the desert on a straight line, thus
 cutting in half the distance he had traveled when going into it. He camped
 that night on the sand and early the next morning took up his journey. It
 was noon when he began to notice familiar sights, and an hour later he
 passed within a mile of line-house No. 3, Double Arrow. Half an hour later
 he espied a cow-puncher riding like mad. Thinking that an investigation
 would not be out of place, he rode after the rider and overtook him, when
 that person paused and retraced his course.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hullo, Hopalong!" shouted the puncher and he came near enough to
 recognize his pursuer. "Thought yu was farmin' up on th' Staked Plain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hullo, Pie," replied Hopalong, recognizing Pie Willis. "What was yu
 chasin' so hard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Coyote?damn 'em, but can't they go some? They're gettin' so thick
 we'll shore have to try strichnine an' thin 'em out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought anybody that had been raised in th' Panhandle would know
 better'n to chase greased lightnin'," rebuked Hopalong. "Yu has got about
 as much show catchin' one of them as a tenderfoot has of bustin' an
 outlawed cayuse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore; I know it," responded Pie, grinning. "But it's fun seem' them hunt
 th' horizon. What are yu doin' down here an' where are yore pardners?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thereupon Hopalong enlightened his inquisitive companion as to what had
 occurred and as to his reasons for riding south.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pie immediately became enthusiastic and announced his intention of
 accompanying Hopalong on his quest, which intention struck that gentleman
 as highly proper and wise. Then Pie hastily turned and played at chasing
 coyotes in the direction of the line-house, where he announced that his
 absence would be accounted for by the fact that he and Hopalong were going
 on a journey of investigation into the Panhandle. Billy Jordan who shared
 with Pie the accommodations of the house, objected and showed, very
 clearly, why he was eminently better qualified to take up the proposed
 labors than his companions. The suggestions were fast getting tangled up
 with the remarks, when Pie, grabbing a chunk of jerked beef, leaped into
 his saddle and absolutely refused to heed the calls of his former
 companion and return. He rode to where Hopalong was awaiting him as if he
 was afraid he wasn't going to live long enough to get there. Confiding to
 his companion that Billy was a "locoed sage hen," he led the way along the
 base of the White Sand Hills and asked many questions. Then they turned
 toward the east and galloped hard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It had been Hopalong's intention to carry out what he had told Red and to
 go to Big Spring first and thence north along Sulphur Spring Creek, but to
 this his guide strongly dissented. There was a short cut, or several of
 them for that matter, was Pie's contention, and any one of them would save
 a day's hard riding. Hopalong made no objection to allowing his companion
 to lead the way over any trail he saw fit, for he knew that Pie had been
 born and brought up in the Panhandle, the Cunningham Lake district having
 been his back yard, as it were. So they followed the short cut having the
 most water and grass, and pounded out a lively tattoo as they raced over
 the stretches of sand which seemed to slide beneath them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do yu know about this here business?" Inquired Pie, as they raced
 past a chaparral and onto the edge of a grassy plain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothin' more'n yu do, only Buck said he thought Slippery Trendley is at
 th' bottom of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" ejaculated Pie in surprise. "Him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore on. An' between yu an' me an' th' Devil, I wouldn't be a heap
 surprised if Deacon Rankin is with him, neither."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pie whistled: "Are him an' th' Deacon pals?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," replied Hopalong, buttoning up his vest and rolling a cigarette.
 "Didn't they allus hang out together! One watched that th' other didn't
 get plugged from behind. It was a sort of
 yu-scratch-my-back-an'-I'll-scratch-yourn arrangement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if they still hangs out together, I know where to hunt for our
 cows," responded Pie. "Th' Deacon used to range along th' headwaters of
 th' Colorado?it ain't far from Cunningham Lake. Thunderation!" he
 shouted, "I knows th' very ground they're on?I can take yu to th'
 very shack!" Then to himself he muttered: "An' that doodlebug Billy Jordan
 thinkin' he knowed more about th' Panhandle than me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong showed his elation in an appropriate manner and his companion
 drank deeply from the proffered flask; Thereupon they treated their mounts
 to liberal doses of strap-oil and covered the ground with great speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They camped early, for Hopalong was almost worn out from the exertions of
 the past few days and the loss of sleep he had sustained. Pie, too excited
 to sleep and having had unbroken rest for a long period, volunteered to
 keep guard, and his companion eagerly consented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Early the next morning they broke camp and the evening of the same day
 found them fording Sulphur Spring Creek, and their quarry lay only an hour
 beyond, according to Pie. Then they forded one of the streams which form
 the headwaters of the Colorado, and two hours later they dismounted in a
 cottonwood grove. Picketing their horses, they carefully made their way
 through the timber, which was heavily grown with brush, and, after half an
 hour's maneuvering, came within sight of the further edge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dropping down on all fours, they crawled to the last line of brush and
 looked out over an extensive bottoms. At their feet lay a small river, and
 in a clearing on the farther side was a rough camp, consisting of about a
 dozen leanto shacks and log cabins in the main collection, and a few
 scattered cabins along the edge. A huge fire was blazing before the main
 collection of huts, and to the rear of these was an indistinct black mass,
 which they knew to be the corral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At a rude table before the fire more than a score of men were eating
 supper and others could be heard moving about and talking at different
 points in the background. While the two scouts were learning the lay of
 the land, they saw Mr. Trendley and Deacon Rankin walk out of the cabin
 most distant from the fire, and the latter limped. Then they saw two men
 lying on rude cots, and they wore bandages. Evidently Johnny Redmond had
 scored in his fight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The odor of burning cowhide came from the corral, accompanied by the
 squeals of cattle, and informed them that brands were being blotted out.
 Hopalong longed to charge down and do some blotting out of another kind,
 but a heavy hand was placed on his shoulder and he silently wormed his way
 after Pie as that person led the way back to the horses. Mounting, they
 picked their way out of the grove and rode over the plain at a walk. When
 far enough away to insure that the noise made by their horses would not
 reach the ears of those in the camp they cantered toward the ford they had
 taken on the way up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After emerging from the waters of the last forded stream, Pie raised his
 hand and pointed off toward the northwest, telling his companion to take
 that course to reach Cunningham Lake. He himself would ride south, taking,
 for the saving of time, a yet shorter trail to the Double Arrow, from
 where he would ride to Buck. He and the others would meet Hopalong and Red
 at the split rock they had noticed on their way up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong shook hands with his guide and watched him disappear into the
 night. He imagined he could still catch whiffs of burning cowhide and
 again the picture of the camp came to his mind. Glancing again at the
 point where Pie had disappeared, he stuffed his sombrero under a strap on
 his saddle and slowly rode toward the lake. A coyote slunk past him on a
 time-destroying lope and an owl hooted at the foolishness of men. He
 camped at the base of a cottonwood and at daylight took up his journey
 after a scanty breakfast from his saddle-bags.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shortly before noon he came in sight of the lake and looked for his
 friend. He had just ridden around a clump of cotton-woods when he was hit
 on the back with something large and soft. Turning in his saddle, with his
 Colts ready, he saw Red sitting on a stump, a huge grin extending over his
 features. He replaced the weapon, said something about fools and
 dismounted, kicking aside the bundle of grass his friend had thrown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore easy," remarked Red, tossing aside his cold cigarette.
 "Suppose I was Trendley, where would yu be now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Diggin' a hole to put yu in," pleasantly replied Hopalong. "If I didn't
 know he wasn't around this part of the country I wouldn't a rode as I
 did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man on the stump laughed and rolled a fresh cigarette. Lighting it, he
 inquired where Mr. Trendley was, intimating by his words that the rustler
 had not been found.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About thirty miles to th' southeast," responded the other. "He's figurin'
 up how much dust he'll have when he gets our cows on th' market. Deacon
 Rankin is with him, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' deuce!" exclaimed Red, in profound astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore right," replied his companion. Then he explained all the
 arrangements and told of the camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red was for riding to the rendezvous at once, but his friend thought
 otherwise and proposed a swim, which met with approval. After enjoying
 themselves in the lake they dressed and rode along the trail Hopalong had
 made in coming for his companion, it being the intention of the former to
 learn more thoroughly the lay of the land immediately surrounding the
 camp. Red was pleased with this, and while they rode he narrated all that
 had taken place since the separation on the Plain, adding that he had
 found the trail left by the rustlers after they had quitted the desert and
 that he had followed it for the last two hours of his journey. It was well
 beaten and an eighth of a mile wide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At dark they came within sight of the grove and picketed their horses at
 the place used by Pie and Hopalong. Then they moved forward and the same
 sight greeted their eyes that had been seen the night before. Keeping well
 within the edge of the grove and looking carefully for sentries, they went
 entirely around the camp and picked out several places which would be of
 strategic value later on. They noticed that the cabin used by Slippery
 Trendley was a hundred paces from the main collection of huts and that the
 woods came to within a tenth part of that distance of its door. It was
 heavily built, had no windows and faced the wrong direction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Moving on, they discovered the storehouse of the enemy, another tempting
 place. It was just possible, if a siege became necessary, for several of
 the attacking force to slip up to it and either destroy it by fire or take
 it and hold it against all comers. This suggested a look at the enemy's
 water supply, which was the river. A hundred paces separated it from the
 nearest cabin and any rustler who could cross that zone under the fire of
 the besiegers would be welcome to his drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was very evident that the rustlers had no thought of defense, thinking,
 perhaps, that they were immune from attack with such a well covered trail
 between them and their foes. Hopalong mentally accused them of harboring
 suicidal inclinations and returned with his companion to the horses. They
 mounted and sat quietly for a while, and then rode slowly away and at dawn
 reached the split rock, where they awaited the arrival of their friends,
 one sleeping while the other kept guard. Then they drew a rough map of the
 camp, using the sand for paper, and laid out the plan of attack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the evening of the next day came on they saw Pie, followed by many
 punchers, ride over a rise a mile to the south and they rode out to meet
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the force arrived at the camp of the two scouts they were shown the
 plan prepared for them. Buck made a few changes in the disposition of the
 men and then each member was shown where he was to go and was told why.
 Weapons were put in a high state of efficiency, canteens were refilled and
 haversacks were somewhat depleted. Then the newcomers turned in and slept
 while Hopalong and Red kept guard.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXI. The Call
 </h2>
 <p>
 At three o'clock the next morning a long line of men slowly filed into the
 cottonwood grove, being silently swallowed up by the dark. Dismounting,
 they left their horses in the care of three of their number and
 disappeared into the brush. Ten minutes later forty of the force were
 distributed along the edge of the grove fringing on the bank of the river
 and twenty more minutes gave ample time for a detachment of twenty to
 cross the stream and find concealment in the edge of the woods which ran
 from the river to where the corral made an effective barrier on the south.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eight crept down on the western side of the camp and worked their way
 close to Mr. Trendley's cabin door, and the seven who followed this
 detachment continued and took up their positions at the rear of the
 corral, where, it was hoped, some of the rustlers would endeavor to escape
 into the woods by working their way through the cattle in the corral and
 then scaling the stockade wall. These seven were from the Three Triangle
 and the Double Arrow, and they were positive that any such attempt would
 not be a success from the view-point of the rustlers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two of those who awaited the pleasure of Mr. Trendley crept forward, and a
 rope swished through the air and settled over the stump which lay most
 convenient on the other side of the cabin door. Then the slack moved
 toward the woods, raised from the ground as it grew taut and, with the
 stump for its axis, swung toward the door, where it rubbed gently against
 the rough logs. It was made of braided horsehair, was half an inch in
 diameter and was stretched eight inches above the ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As it touched the door, Lanky Smith, Hopalong and Red stepped out of the
 shelter of the woods and took up their positions behind the cabin, Lanky
 behind the northeast corner where he would be permitted to swing his right
 arm. In his gloved right hand he held the carefully arranged coils of a
 fifty-foot lariat, and should the chief of the rustlers escape tripping he
 would have to avoid the cast of the best roper in the southwest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two others took the northwest corner and one of them leaned slightly
 forward and gently twitched the tripping-rope. The man at the other end
 felt the signal and whispered to a companion, who quietly disappeared in
 the direction of the river and shortly afterward the mournful cry of a
 whip-poor-will dirged out on the early morning air. It had hardly died
 away when the quiet was broken by one terrific crash of rifles, and the
 two camp guards asleep at the fire awoke in another world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trendley, sleeping unusually well for the unjust, leaped from his bed
 to the middle of the floor and alighted on his feet and wide awake.
 Fearing that a plot was being consummated to deprive him of his
 leadership, he grasped the Winchester which leaned at the head of his bed
 and, tearing open the door, crashed headlong to the earth. As he touched
 the ground, two shadows sped out from the shelter of the cabin wall and
 pounced upon him. Men who can rope, throw and tie a wild steer in thirty
 seconds flat do not waste time in trussing operations, and before a minute
 had elapsed he was being carried into the woods, bound and helpless. Lanky
 sighed, threw the rope over one shoulder and departed after his friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Mr. Trendley came to his senses he found himself bound to a tree in
 the grove near the horses. A man sat on a stump not far from him, three
 others were seated around a small fire some distance to the north, and
 four others, one of whom carried a rope, made their way into the brush. He
 strained at his bonds, decided that the effort was useless and watched the
 man on the stump, who struck a match and lit a pipe. The prisoner watched
 the light flicker up and go out and there was left in his mind a picture
 that he could never forget. The face which had been so cruelly, so
 grotesquely revealed was that of Frenchy McAllister, and across his knees
 lay a heavy caliber Winchester. A curse escaped from the lips of the
 outlaw; the man on the stump spat at a firefly and smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the south came the crack of rifles, incessant and sharp. The reports
 rolled from one end of the clearing to the other and seemed to sweep in
 waves from the center of the line to the ends. Faintly in the infrequent
 lulls in the firing came an occasional report from the rear of the corral,
 where some desperate rustler paid for his venture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck went along the line and spoke to the riflemen, and after some time
 had passed and the light had become stronger, he collected the men into
 groups of five and six. Taking one group and watching it closely, it could
 be seen that there was a world of meaning in this maneuver. One man
 started firing at a particular window in an opposite hut and then laid
 aside his empty gun and waited. When the muzzle of his enemy's gun came
 into sight and lowered until it had nearly gained its sight level, the
 rifles of the remainder of the group crashed out in a volley and usually
 one of the bullets, at least, found its intended billet. This volley
 firing became universal among the besiegers and the effect was marked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two men sprinted from the edge of the woods near Mr. Trendley's cabin and
 gained the shelter of the storehouse, which soon broke out in flames. The
 burning brands fell over the main collection of huts, where there was much
 confusion and swearing. The early hour at which the attack had been
 delivered at first led the besieged to believe that it was an Indian
 affair, but this impression was soon corrected by the volley firing, which
 turned hope into despair. It was no great matter to fight Indians, that
 they had done many times and found more or less enjoyment in it; but there
 was a vast difference between brave and puncher, and the chances of their
 salvation became very small. They surmised that it was the work of the
 cow-men on whom they had preyed and that vengeful punchers lay hidden
 behind that death-fringe of green willow and hazel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red, assisted by his inseparable companion, Hopalong, laboriously climbed
 up among the branches of a black walnut and hooked one leg over a
 convenient limb. Then he lowered his rope and drew up the Winchester which
 his accommodating friend fastened to it. Settling himself in a comfortable
 position and sheltering his body somewhat by the tree, he shaded his eyes
 by a hand and peered into the windows of the distant cabins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is she, Red?" Anxiously inquired the man on the ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bully: want to come up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nope. I'm goin' to catch yu when yu lets go," replied Hopalong with a
 grin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which same I ain't goin' to," responded the man in the tree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He swung his rifle out over a forked limb and let it settle in the crotch.
 Then he slew his head around until he gained the bead he wished. Five
 minutes passed before he caught sight of his man and then he fired.
 Jerking out the empty shell he smiled and called out to his friend: "One."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong grinned and went off to tell Buck to put all the men in trees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Night came on and still the firing continued. Then an explosion shook the
 woods. The storehouse had blown up and a sky full of burning timber fell
 on the cabins and soon three were half consumed, their occupants dropping
 as they gained the open air. One hundred paces makes fine pot-shooting, as
 Deacon Rankin discovered when evacuation was the choice necessary to avoid
 cremation. He never moved after he touched the ground and Red called out:
 "Two," not knowing that his companion had departed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The morning of the next day found a wearied and hopeless garrison, and
 shortly before noon a soiled white shirt was flung from a window in the
 nearest cabin. Buck ran along the line and ordered the firing to cease and
 caused to be raised an answering flag of truce. A full minute passed and
 then the door slowly opened and a leg protruded, more slowly followed by
 the rest of the man, and Cheyenne Charley strode out to the bank of the
 river and sat down. His example was followed by several others and then an
 unexpected event occurred. Those in the cabins who preferred to die
 fighting, angered at this desertion, opened fire on their former comrades,
 who barely escaped by rolling down the slightly inclined bank into the
 river. Red fired again and laughed to himself. Then the fugitives swam
 down the river and landed under the guns of the last squad. They were
 taken to the rear and, after being bound, were placed under a guard. There
 were seven in the party and they looked worn out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the huts were burning the fiercest the uproar in the corral arose to
 such a pitch as to drown all other sounds. There were left within its
 walls a few hundred cattle whose brands had not yet been blotted out, and
 these, maddened to frenzy by the shooting and the flames, tore from one
 end of the enclosure to the other, crashing against the alternate walls
 with a noise which could be heard far out on the plain. Scores were
 trampled to death on each charge and finally the uproar subsided in sheer
 want of cattle left with energy enough to continue. When the corral was
 investigated the next day there were found the bodies of four rustlers,
 but recognition was impossible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several of the defenders were housed in cabins having windows in the rear
 walls, which the occupants considered fortunate. This opinion was revised,
 however, after several had endeavored to escape by these openings. The
 first thing that occurred when a man put his head out was the hum of a
 bullet, and in two cases the experimenters lost all need of escape.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The volley firing had the desired effect, and at dusk there remained only
 one cabin from which came opposition. Such a fire was concentrated on it
 that before an hour had passed the door fell in and the firing ceased.
 There was a rush from the side, and the Barred Horseshoe men who swarmed
 through the cabins emerged without firing a shot. The organization that
 had stirred up the Pecos Valley ranches had ceased to exist.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXII. The Showdown
 </h2>
 <p>
 A fire burned briskly in front of Mr. Trendley's cabin that night and
 several punchers sat around it occupied in various ways. Two men leaned
 against the wall and sang softly of the joys of the trail and the range.
 One of them, Lefty Allen, of the O-Bar-O, sang in his sweet tenor, and
 other men gradually strolled up and seated themselves on the ground, where
 the fitful gleam of responsive pipes and cigarettes showed like fireflies.
 The songs followed one after another, first a lover's plea in soft Spanish
 and then a rollicking tale of the cow-towns and men. Supper had long since
 been enjoyed and all felt that life was, indeed, well worth living.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A shadow loomed against the cabin wall and a procession slowly made its
 way toward the open door. The leader, Hopalong, disappeared within and was
 followed by Mr. Trendley, bound and hobbled and tied to Red, the rear
 being brought up by Frenchy, whose rifle lolled easily in the crotch of
 his elbow. The singing went on uninterrupted and the hum of voices between
 the selections remained unchanged. Buck left the crowd around the fire and
 went into the cabin, where his voice was heard assenting to something.
 Hopalong emerged and took a seat at the fire, sending two punchers to take
 his place. He was joined by Frenchy and Red, the former very quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the center of a distant group were seven men who were not armed. Their
 belts, half full of cartridges, supported empty holsters. They sat and
 talked to the men around them, swapping notes and experiences, and in
 several instances found former friends and acquaintances. These men were
 not bound and were apparently members of Buck's force. Then one of them
 broke down, but quickly regained his nerve and proposed a game of cards. A
 fire was started and several games were immediately in progress. These
 seven men were to die at daybreak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the night grew older man after man rolled himself in his blanket and
 lay down where he sat, sinking off to sleep with a swiftness that bespoke
 tired muscles and weariness. All through the night, however, there were
 twelve men on guard, of whom three were in the cabin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At daybreak a shot from one of the guards awakened every man within
 hearing, and soon they romped and scampered down to the river's edge to
 indulge in the luxury of a morning plunge. After an hour's horseplay they
 trooped back to the cabin and soon had breakfast out of the way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Waffles, foreman of the O-Bar-O, and You-bet Somes strolled over to the
 seven unfortunates who had just completed a choking breakfast and nodded a
 hearty "Good morning." Then others came up and finally all moved off
 toward the river. Crossing it, they disappeared into the grove and all
 sounds of their advance grew into silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trendley, escorted outside for the air, saw the procession as it
 became lost to sight in the brush. He sneered and asked for a smoke, which
 was granted. Then his guards were changed and the men began to straggle
 back from the grove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trendley, with his back to the cabin, scowled defiantly at the crowd
 that hemmed him in. The coolest, most damnable murderer in the West was
 not now going to beg for mercy. When he had taken up crime as a means of
 livelihood he had decided that if the price to be paid for his course was
 death, he would pay like a man. He glanced at the cottonwood grove,
 wherein were many ghastly secrets, and smiled. His hairless eyebrows
 looked like livid scars and his lips quivered in scorn and anger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he sneered at Buck there was a movement in the crowd before him and a
 pathway opened for Frenchy, who stepped forward slowly and deliberately,
 as if on his way to some bar for a drink. There was something different
 about the man who had searched the Staked Plain with Hopalong and Red: he
 was not the same puncher who had arrived from Montana three weeks before.
 There was lacking a certain air of carelessness and he chilled his
 friends, who looked upon him as if they had never really known him. He
 walked up to Mr. Trendley and gazed deeply into the evil eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Twenty years before, Frenchy McAllister had changed his identity from a
 happy-go-lucky, devil-may-care cow-puncher and became a machine. The grief
 that had torn his soul was not of the kind which seeks its outlet in tears
 and wailing; it had turned and struck inward, and now his deliberate
 ferocity was icy and devilish. Only a glint in his eyes told of
 exultation, and his words were sharp and incisive; one could well imagine
 one heard the click of his teeth as they bit off the consonants: every
 letter was clear-cut, every syllable startling in its clearness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twenty years and two months ago to-day," he began, "you arrived at the
 ranchhouse of the Double Y, up near the Montana-Wyoming line. Everything
 was quiet, except, perhaps, a woman's voice, singing. You entered, and
 before you left you pinned a note to that woman's dress. I found it, and
 it is due."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The air of carelessness disappeared from the members of the crowd and the
 silence became oppressive. Most of those present knew parts of Frenchy's
 story, and all were in hearty accord with anything he might do. He reached
 within his vest and brought forth a deerskin bag. Opening it, he drew out
 a package of oiled silk and from that he took a paper. Carefully replacing
 the silk and the bag, he slowly unfolded the sheet in his hand and handed
 it to Buck, whose face hardened. Two decades had passed since the foreman
 of the Bar-20 had seen that precious sheet, but the scene of its finding
 would never fade from his memory. He stood as if carved from stone, with a
 look on his face that made the crowd shift uneasily and glance at
 Trendley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy turned to the rustler and regarded him evilly. "You are the
 hellish brute that wrote that note," pointing to the paper in the hand of
 his friend. Then, turning again, he spoke: "Buck, read that paper."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman cleared his throat and read distinctly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "McAllister: Yore wife is too blame good to live.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> TRENDLEY."
</pre>
 <p>
 There was a shuffling sound, but Buck and Frenchy, silently backed up by
 Hopalong and Red, intervened, and the crowd fell back, where it surged in
 indecision.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," said Frenchy, "I want you to vote on whether any man here has
 more right to do with Slippery Trendley as he sees fit than myself. Any
 one who thinks so, or that he should be treated like the others, step
 forward. Majority rules."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no advance and he spoke again: "Is there any one here who
 objects to this man dying?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong and Red awkwardly bumped their knuckles against their guns and
 there was no response.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The prisoner was bound with cowhide to the wall of the cabin and four men
 sat near and facing him. The noonday meal was eaten in silence, and the
 punchers rode off to see about rounding up the cattle that grazed over the
 plain as far as eye could see. Supper-time came and passed, and busy men
 rode away in all directions. Others came and relieved the guards, and at
 midnight another squad took up the vigil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Day broke and the thunder of hoofs as the punchers rounded up the cattle
 became very noticeable. One herd swept past toward the south, guarded and
 guided by fifteen men. Two hours later and another followed, taking a
 slightly different trail so as to avoid the close-cropped grass left by
 the first. At irregular intervals during the day other herds swept by,
 until six had passed and denuded the plain of cattle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck, perspiring and dusty, accompanied by Hopalong and Red, rode up to
 where the guards smoked and joked. Frenchy came out of the cabin and
 smiled at his friends. Swinging in his left hand was a newly filled Colt's
 .45, which was recognized by his friends as the one found in the cabin and
 it bore a rough "T" gouged in the butt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck looked around and cleared his throat: "We've got th' cows on th' home
 trail, Frenchy," he suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yas?" Inquired Frenchy. "Are there many?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yas," replied Buck, waving his hand at the guards, ordering them to
 follow their friends. "It's a good deal for us: we've done right smart
 this hand. An' it's a good thing we've got so many punchers: we got a lot
 of cattle to drive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About five times th' size of th' herd that blamed near made angels out'en
 me an' yu," responded Frenchy with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope almighty hard that we don't have no stampedes on this here drive.
 If th' last herds go wild they'll pick up th' others, an' then there'll be
 th' devil to pay."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy smiled again and shot a glance at where Mr. Trendley was bound to
 the cabin wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck looked steadily southward for some time and then flecked a foam-sud
 from the flank of his horse. "We are goin' south along th' Creek until we
 gets to Big Spring, where we'll turn right smart to th' west. We won't be
 able to average more'n twelve miles a day, 'though I'm goin' to drive them
 hard. How's yore grub?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Grub to burn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Got yore rope?" Asked the foreman of the Bar-20, speaking as if the
 question had no especial meaning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy smiled: "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong absent-mindedly jabbed his spurs into his mount with the result
 that when the storm had subsided the spell was broken and he said "So
 long," and rode south, followed by Buck and Red. As they swept out of
 sight behind a grove Red turned in his saddle and waved his hat. Buck
 discussed with assiduity the prospects of a rainfall and was very cheerful
 about the recovery of the stolen cattle. Red could see a tall,
 broad-shouldered man standing with his feet spread far apart, swinging a
 Colt's .45, and Hopalong swore at everything under the sun. Dust arose in
 streaming clouds far to the south and they spurred forward to overtake the
 outfits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Peters, riding over the starlit plain, in his desire to reach the
 first herd, which slept somewhere to the west of him under the care of
 Waffles, thought of the events of the past few weeks and gradually became
 lost in the memories of twenty years before, which crowded up before his
 mind like the notes of a half-forgotten song. His nature, tempered by two
 decades of a harsh existence, softened as he lived again the years that
 had passed and as he thought of the things which had been. He was so
 completely lost in his reverie that he failed to hear the muffled
 hoofbeats of a horse that steadily gained upon him, and when Frenchy
 McAllister placed a friendly hand on his shoulder he started as if from a
 deep sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two looked at each other and their hands met. The question which
 sprang into Buck's eyes found a silent answer in those of his friend. They
 rode on side by side through the clear night and together drifted back to
 the days of the Double Y.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After an hour had passed, the foreman of the Bar-20 turned to his
 companion and then hesitated:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did, did?was he a cur?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Frenchy looked off toward the south and, after an interval, replied:
 "Yas." Then, as an after thought, he added, "Yu see, he never reckoned it
 would be that way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck nodded, although he did not fully understand, and the subject was
 forever closed.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIII. Mr. Cassidy Meets a Woman
 </h2>
 <p>
 The work of separating the cattle into herds of the different brands was
 not a big contract, and with so many men it took but a comparatively short
 time, and in two days all signs of the rustlers had faded. It was then
 that good news went the rounds and the men looked forward to a week of
 pleasure, which was all the sharper accentuated by the grim mercilessness
 of the expedition into the Panhandle. Here was a chance for unlimited
 hilarity and a whole week in which to give strict attention to celebrating
 the recent victory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So one day Mr. Hopalong Cassidy rode rapidly over the plain, thinking
 about the joys and excitement promised by the carnival to be held at Muddy
 Wells. With that rivalry so common to Western towns the inhabitants
 maintained that the carnival was to break all records, this because it was
 to be held in their town. Perry's Bend and Buckskin had each promoted a
 similar affair, and if this year's festivities were to be an improvement
 on those which had gone before, they would most certainly be worth riding
 miles to see. Perry's Bend had been unfortunate m being the first to hold
 a carnival, inasmuch as it only set a mark to be improved upon, and
 Buckskin had taken advantage of this and had added a brass band, and now
 in turn was to be eclipsed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The events slated were numerous and varied, the most important being those
 which dealt directly with the everyday occupations of the inhabitants of
 that section of the country. Broncho busting, steer-roping and tying,
 rifle and revolver shooting, trick riding and fancy roping made up the
 main features of the programme and were to be set off by horse and foot
 racing and other county fair necessities. Altogether, the proud citizens
 of the town looked forward with keen anticipation to the coming
 excitements, and were prone to swagger a bit and to rub their hands in
 condescending egoism, while the crowded gambling halls and saloons, and
 the three-card-monte men on the street corners enriched themselves at the
 cost of venturesome know-it-ails.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong was firmly convinced that his day of hard riding was well worth
 while, for the Bar-20 was to be represented in strength. Probably a
 clearer insight into his idea of a carnival can be gained by his
 definition, grouchily expressed to Red Connors on the day following the
 last affair: "Raise cain, go broke, wake up an' begin punching cows all
 over again." But that was the day after and the day after is always filled
 with remorse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong and Red, having twice in succession won the revolver and rifle
 competitions, respectively, hoped to make it 'Three straight.' Lanky
 Smith, the Bar-20 rope expert, had taken first prize in the only contest
 he had entered. Skinny Thompson had lost and drawn with Lefty Allen, of
 the O-Bar-O, in the broncho-busting event, but as Skinny had improved
 greatly in the interval, his friends confidently expected him to "yank
 first place" for the honor of his ranch. These expectations were backed
 with all the available Bar-20 money, and, if they were not realized,
 something in the nature of a calamity would swoop down upon and wrap that
 ranch in gloom. Since the O-Bar-O was aggressively optimistic the betting
 was at even money, hats and guns, and the losers would begin life anew so
 far as earthly possessions were concerned. No other competitors were
 considered in this event, as Skinny and Lefty had so far outclassed all
 others that the honor was believed to lie between these two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong, blissfully figuring out the chances of the different
 contestants, galloped around a clump of mesquite only fifteen miles from
 Muddy Wells and stiffened in his saddle, for twenty rods ahead of him on
 the trail was a woman. As she heard him approach she turned and waited for
 him to overtake her, and when she smiled he raised his sombrero and bowed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you please tell me where I am?" She asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu are fifteen miles southeast of Muddy Wells," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But which is southeast?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right behind yu," he answered. "Th' town lies right ahead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you going there?" She asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you will not care if I ride with you?" She asked. "I am a trifle
 frightened."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I'd be some pleased if yu do, 'though there ain't nothing out here
 to be afraid of now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I had no intention of getting lost," she assured him, "but I dismounted
 to pick flowers and cactus leaves and after a while I had no conception of
 where I was."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is it yu are out here?" He asked. "Yu shouldn't get so far from
 town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, papa is an invalid and doesn't like to leave his room, and the town
 is so dull, although the carnival is waking it up somewhat. Having nothing
 to do I procured a horse and determined to explore the country. Why, this
 is like Stanley and Livingstone, isn't it? You rescued the explorer!" And
 she laughed heartily. He wondered who in thunder Stanley and Livingstone
 were, but said nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I like the West, it is so big and free," she continued. "But it is very
 monotonous at times, especially when compared with New York. Papa swears
 dreadfully at the hotel and declares that the food will drive him insane,
 but I notice that he eats much more heartily than he did when in the city.
 And the service!?it is awful. But when one leaves the town behind it
 is splendid, and I can appreciate it because I had such a hard season in
 the city last winter?so many balls, parties and theaters that I
 simply wore myself out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never hankered much for them things," Hopalong replied. "An' I don't
 like th' towns much, either. Once or twice a year I gets as far as Kansas
 City, but I soon tires of it an' hits th' back trail. Yu see, I don't like
 a fence country?I wants lots of room an' air."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She regarded him intently: "I know that you will think me very forward."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He smiled and slowly replied: "I think yu are all O. K."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There do not appear to be many women in this country," she suggested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, there ain't many," he replied, thinking of the kind to be found in
 all of the cow-towns. "They don't seem to hanker for this kind of life?they
 wants parties an' lots of dancin' an' them kind of things. I reckon there
 ain't a whole lot to tempt em to come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You evidently regard women as being very frivolous," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm speakin' from there not being any out here," he responded,
 "although I don't know much about them, to tell th' truth. Them what are
 out here can't be counted." Then he flushed and looked away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She ignored the remark and placed her hand to her hair:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness! My hair must look terrible!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned and looked: "Yore hair is pretty?I allus did like brown
 hair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed and put back the straggling locks: "It is terrible! Just look
 at it! Isn't it awful?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, no: I reckons not," he replied critically. "It looks sort of free
 an' easy thataway."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's no matter, it cannot be helped," she laughed. "Let's race!"
 she cried and was off like a shot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He humored her until he saw that her mount was getting unmanageable, when
 he quietly overtook her and closed her pony's nostrils with his hand, the
 operation having a most gratifying effect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Joe hadn't oughter let yu had this cayuse," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how do you know of whom I procured it?" She asked. "By th' brand:
 it's a O-Bar-O, canceled, with J. H. over it. He buys all of his cayuses
 from th' O-Bar-O."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She found out his name, and, after an interval of silence, she turned to
 him with eyes full of inquiry: "What is that thorny shrub just ahead?" She
 asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's mesquite," he replied eagerly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me all about it," she commanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, there ain't much to tell," he replied, "only it's a valuable tree
 out here. Th' Apaches use it a whole lot of ways. They get honey from th'
 blossoms an' glue an' gum, an' they use th' bark for tannin' hide. Th'
 dried pods an' leaves are used to feed their cattle, an' th' wood makes
 corrals to keep 'em in. They use th' wood for making other things, too,
 an' it is of two colors. Th' sap makes a dye what won't wash out, an' th'
 beans make a bread what won't sour or get hard. Then it makes a barrier
 that shore is a dandy-coyotes an' men can't get through it, an' it
 protects a whole lot of birds an' things. Th' snakes hate it like poison,
 for th' thorns get under their scales an' whoops things up for 'em. It
 keeps th' sand from shiftin', too. Down South where there is plenty of
 water, it often grows forty feet high, but up here it squats close to th'
 ground so it can save th' moisture. In th' night th' temperature sometimes
 falls thirty degrees, an' that helps it, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How can it live without water?" She asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It gets all th' water it wants," he replied, smiling. "Th' tap roots go
 straight down 'til they find it, sometimes fifty feet. That's why it don't
 shrivel up in th' sun. Then there are a lot of little roots right under it
 an' they protects th' tap roots. Th' shade it gives is th' coolest out
 here, for th' leaves turn with th' wind an' lets th' breeze
 through-they're hung on little stems."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How splendid!" she exclaimed. "Oh! Look there!" she cried, pointing ahead
 of them. A chaparral cock strutted from its decapitated enemy, a
 rattlesnake, and disappeared in the chaparral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong laughed: "Mr. Scissors-bill Road-runner has great fun with
 snakes. He runs along th' sand-an' he can run, too?an' sees a snake
 takin' a siesta. Snip! goes his bill an' th' snake slides over th' Divide.
 Our fighting friend may stop some coyote's appetite before morning,
 though, unless he stays where he is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then a gray wolf blundered in sight a few rods ahead of them, and
 Hopalong fired instantly. His companion shrunk from him and looked at him
 reproachfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did you do that!" she demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, because they costs us big money every year," he replied. "There's a
 bounty on them because they pull down calves, an' sometimes full grown
 cows. I'm shore wonderin' why he got so close?they're usually just
 out of range, where they stays."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Promise me that you will shoot no more while I am with you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, shore: I didn't think yu'd care," he replied. "Yu are like that
 sky-pilot over to Las Cruces?he preached agin killin' things, which
 is all right for him, who didn't have no cows."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you go to the missions?" She asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He replied that he did, sometimes, but forgot to add that it was usually
 for the purpose of hilarity, for he regarded sky-pilots with humorous
 toleration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me all about yourself?what you do for enjoyment and all about
 your work," she requested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He explained in minute detail the art of punching cows, and told her more
 of the West in half an hour than she could have learned from a year's
 experience. She showed such keen interest in his words that it was a
 pleasure to talk to her, and he monopolized the conversation until the
 town intruded its sprawling collection of unpainted shacks and adobe huts
 in their field of vision.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIV. The Strategy of Mr. Peters
 </h2>
 <p>
 Hopalong and his companion rode into Muddy Wells at noon, and Red Connors,
 who leaned with Buck Peters against the side of Tom Lee's saloon, gasped
 his astonishment. Buck looked twice to be sure, and then muttered
 incredulously: "What th' heck!" Red repeated the phrase and retreated
 within the saloon, while Buck stood his ground, having had much experience
 with women, inasmuch as he had narrowly escaped marrying. He thought that
 he might as well get all the information possible, and waited for an
 introduction. It was in vain, however, for the two rode past without
 noticing him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck watched them turn the corner and then called for Red to come out, but
 that person, fearing an ordeal, made no reply and the foreman went in
 after him. The timorous one was corraling bracers at the bar and nearly
 swallowed down the wrong channel when Buck placed a heavy hand on his
 broad shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "G'way!" remarked Red. "I don't want no introduction, none whatever," he
 asserted. "G'way!" he repeated, backing off suspiciously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Better wait 'til yu are asked," suggested Buck. "Better wait 'til yu sees
 th' rope afore yu duck." Then he laughed: "Yu bashful fellers make me
 plumb disgusted. Why, I've seen yu face a bunch of guns an never turn a
 hair, an' here yore all in because yu fear yu'll have to stand around an'
 hide yore hands. She won't bite yu. Anyway, from what I saw, Hopalong is
 due to be her grub?he never saw me at all, th' chump."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He shore didn't see me, none," replied Red with distinct relief. "Are
 they gone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shore," answered Buck. "An' if they wasn't they wouldn't see us, not if
 we stood in front of them an' yelled. She's a hummer-stands two hands
 under him an' is a whole lot prettier than that picture Cowan has got over
 his bar. There's nothing th' matter with his eyesight, but he's plumb
 locoed, all th' same. He'll go an' get stuck on her an' then she'll hit
 th' trail for home an' mamma, an' he won't be worth his feed for a year."
 Then he paused in consternation: "Thunder, Red: he's got to shoot
 to-morrow!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, suppose he has?" Responded Red. "I don't reckon she'll stampede his
 gun-play none.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu don't reckon, eh?" Queried Buck with much irony. "No, an' that's
 what's th' matter with yu. Why, do yu expect to see him to-morrow? Yu
 won't if I knows him an' I reckon I do. Nope, he'll be follerin' her all
 around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's got sand to burn," remarked Red in awe. "Wonder how he got to know
 her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu can gamble she did th' introducing part?he ain't got th' nerve
 to do it himself. He saved her life, or she thinks he did, or some
 romantic nonsense like that. So yu better go around an' get him away, an'
 keep him away, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who, me?" Inquired Red in indignation. "Me go around an' tote him off? I
 ain't no wagon: yu go, or send Johnny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Johnny would say something real pert an' get knocked into th' middle of
 next week for it. He won't do, so I reckon yu better go yoreself,"
 responded Buck, smiling broadly and moving off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu! Wait a minute!" cried Red in consternation. Buck paused and Red
 groped for an excuse: "Why don't you send Billy?" He blurted in
 desperation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman's smile assumed alarming proportions and he slapped his thigh
 in joy: "Good boy!" he laughed. "Billy's th' man?good Lord, but
 won't he give Cupid cold feet! Rustle around an' send th' pessimistic soul
 to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red, grinning and happy, rapidly visited door after door, shouted, "Hey,
 Billy!" and proceeded to the next one. He was getting pugnacious at his
 lack of success when he espied Mr. Billy Williams tacking along the
 accidental street as if he owned it. Mr. Williams was executing fancy
 steps and was trying to sing many songs at once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red stopped and grabbed his bibulous friend as that person veered to
 starboard: "Yore a peach of a life-preserver, yu are!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy balanced himself, swayed back and forth and frowned his displeasure
 at this unwarranted action: "I ain't no wife-deserter!" he shouted.
 "Unrope me an' give me th' trail! No tenderfoot can ride me!" Then he
 recognized his friend and grinned joyously: "Shore I will, but only one.
 Jus' one more, jus' one more. Yu see, m'friend, it was all Jimmy's fault.
 He?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red secured a chancery hold and dragged his wailing and remonstrating
 friend to Buck, who frowned with displeasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This yere," said Red in belligerent disgust, "is th' dod-blasted hero
 what's a-goin' to save Hopalong from a mournful future. What are we
 a-goin' to do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck slipped the Colt's from Billy's holster and yanked the erring one to
 his feet: "Fill him full of sweet oil, source him in th' trough, walk him
 around for awhile an' see what it does," he ordered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two hours later Billy walked up to his foreman and weakly asked what was
 wanted. He looked as though he had just been released from a six-months'
 stay in a hospital.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu go over to th' hotel an' find Hopalong," said the foreman sternly.
 "Stay with him all th' time, for there is a plot on foot to wing him on
 th' sly. If yu ain't mighty spry he'll be dead by night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Having delivered the above instructions and prevarications, Buck throttled
 the laugh which threatened to injure him and scowled at Red, who again
 fled into the saloon for fear of spoiling it all with revealed mirth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The convalescent stared in open-mouthed astonishment:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's he doin' in th' hotel, an' who's goin' to plug him?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu leave that to me," replied Buck, "All yu has to do is to get on th'
 job with yore gun," handing the weapon to him, "an' freeze to him like a
 flea on a cow. Mebby there'll be a woman in th' game, but that ain't none
 of yore funeral?yu do what I said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blast th' women!" exploded Billy, moving off. When he had entered the
 hotel Buck went in to Red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For Pete's sake!" moaned that person in senseless reiteration. "Th' Lord
 help Billy! Holy Mackinaw!" he shouted. "Gimme a drink an' let me tell th'
 boys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The members of the outfit were told of the plot and they gave their
 uproarious sanction, all needing bracers to sustain them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Billy found the clerk swapping lies with the bartender and, procuring the
 desired information, climbed the stairs and hunted for room No. 6.
 Discovering it, he dispensed with formality, pushed open the door and
 entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He found his friend engaged in conversation with a pretty young woman, and
 on a couch at the far side of the room lay an elderly white-whiskered
 gentleman who was reading a magazine. Billy felt like a criminal for a few
 seconds and then there came to him the thought that his was a mission of
 great import and he braced himself to face any ordeal. "Anyway," he
 thought, "th' prettier they are th' more dust they can raise."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are yu doing here?" Cried Hopalong in amazement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's all right," averred the protector, confidentially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's all right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, everything," replied Billy, feeling uncomfortable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elderly man hastily sat up and dropped his magazine when he saw the
 armed intruder, his eyes as wide open as his mouth. He felt for his
 spectacles, but did not need them, for he could see nothing but the Colt's
 which Billy jabbed at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None of that!" snapped Billy. "'ands up!" he ordered, and the hands went
 up so quick that when they stopped the jerk shook the room. Peering over
 the gentleman's leg, Billy saw the spectacles and backed to the wall as he
 apologized: "It's shore on me, Stranger?I reckoned yu was
 contemplatin' some gun-play."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong, blazing with wrath, arose and shoved Billy toward the hail, when
 Mr. Johnny Nelson, oozing fight and importance, intruded his person into
 the zone of action.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord!" ejaculated the newcomer, staring at the vision of female
 loveliness which so suddenly greeted him. "Mamma," he added under his
 breath. Then he tore off his sombrero: "Come out of this, Billy, yu
 chump!" he exploded, backing toward the door, being followed by the
 protector.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong slammed the door and turned to his hostess, apologizing for the
 disturbance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who are they?" Palpitated Miss Deane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What the deuce are they doing up here!" blazed her father. Hopalong
 disclaimed any knowledge of them and just then Billy opened the door and
 looked in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There he is again!" cried Miss Deane, and her father gasped. Hopalong ran
 out into the hall and narrowly missed kicking Billy into Kingdom Come as
 that person slid down the stairs, surprised and indignant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Billy Williams, who sat at the top of the stairs, was feeling hungry
 and thirsty when he saw his friend, Mr. Pete Wilson, the slow witted,
 approaching.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, Pete," he called, "come up here an' watch this door while I rustles
 some grub. Keep yore eyes open," he cautioned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Pete began to feel restless the door opened and a dignified gentleman
 with white whiskers came out into the hall and then retreated with great
 haste and no dignity. Pete got the drop on the door and waited. Hopalong
 yanked it open and kissed the muzzle of the weapon before he could stop,
 and Pete grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Coming to th' fight?" He loudly asked. "It's going to be a shore 'nough
 sumptious scrap?just th' kind yu allus like. Come on, th' boys are
 waitin' for yu."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep quiet!" hissed Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What for?" Asked Pete in surprise. "Didn't yu say yu shore wanted to see
 that scrap?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shut yore face an' get scarce, or yu'll go home in cans!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Hopalong seated himself once more Red strolled up to the door and
 knocked. Hopalong ripped it open and Red, looking as fierce and worried as
 he could, asked Hopalong if he was all right. Upon being assured by
 smoking adjectives that he was, the caller looked relieved and turned
 thoughtfully away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, yu! Come here!" called Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red waved his hand and said that he had to meet a man and clattered down
 the stairs. Hopalong thought that he, also, had to meet a man and,
 excusing himself, hastened after his friend and overtook him in the
 Street, where he forced a confession. Returning to his hostess he told her
 of the whole outrage, and she was angry at first, but seeing the humorous
 side of it, she became convulsed with laughter. Her father re-read his
 paragraph for the thirteenth time and then, slamming the magazine on the
 floor, asked how many times he was expected to read ten lines before he
 knew what was in them, and went down to the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Deane regarded her companion with laughing eyes and then became
 suddenly sober as he came toward her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go to your foreman and tell him that you will shoot to-morrow, for I will
 see that you do, and I will bring luck to the Bar-20. Be sure to call for
 me at one o'clock: I will be ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hesitated, bowed, and slowly departed, making his way to Tom Lee's,
 where his entrance hushed the hilarity which had reigned. Striding to
 where Buck stood, he placed his hands on his hips and searched the
 foreman's eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck smiled: "Yu ain't mad, are yu?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong relaxed: "No, but blame near it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red and the others grabbed him from the rear, and when he had been
 "buffaloed" into good humor he threw them from him, laughed and waved his
 hand toward the bar:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come up, yu sons-of-guns. Yore a cussed nuisance sometimes, but yore a
 bully gang all th' same."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXV. Mr. Ewalt Draws Cards
 </h2>
 <p>
 Tex Ewalt, cow-puncher, prospector, sometimes a rustler, but always a
 dude, rode from El Paso in deep disgust at his steady losses at faro and
 monte. The pecuniary side of these caused him no worry, for he was flush.
 This pleasing opulence was due to his business ability, for he had
 recently sold a claim for several thousand dollars. The first operation
 was simple, being known in Western phraseology as "jumping"; and the
 second, somewhat more complicated, was known as "salting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first of the money spent went for a complete new outfit, and he had
 parted with just three hundred and seventy dollars to feed his vanity. He
 desired something contrasty and he procured it. His sombrero, of gray felt
 a quarter of an inch thick, flaunted a band of black leather, on which was
 conspicuously displayed a solid silver buckle. His neck was protected by a
 crimson kerchief of the finest, heaviest silk. His shirt, in pattern the
 same as those commonly worn in the cow country, was of buckskin, soft as a
 baby's cheek and impervious to water, and the Angora goatskin chaps, with
 the long silken hair worn outside, were as white as snow. Around his waist
 ran loosely a broad, black leather belt supporting a heavy black holster,
 in which lay its walnut-handled burden, a .44 caliber six-shooter; and
 thirty center-fire cartridges peeked from their loops, fifteen on a side.
 His boots, the soles thin and narrow and the heels high, were black and of
 the finest leather. Huge spurs, having two-inch rowels, were held in place
 by buckskin straps, on which, also, were silver buckles. Protecting his
 hands were heavy buckskin gloves, also waterproof, having wide, black
 gauntlets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each dainty hock of his dainty eight-hundred-pound buckskin pony was
 black, and a black star graced its forehead. Well groomed, with flowing
 mane and tail, and with the brand on its flank being almost imperceptible,
 the animal was far different in appearance from most of the cow-ponies.
 Vicious and high-spirited, it cavorted just enough to show its lines to
 the best advantage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The saddle, a famous Cheyenne and forty pounds in weight, was black,
 richly embossed, and decorated with bits of beaten silver which flashed
 back the sunlight. At the pommel hung a thirty-foot coil of braided
 horsehair rope, and at the rear was a Sharp's .50-caliber, breech-loading
 rifle, its owner having small use for any other make. The color of the
 bridle was the same as the saddle and it supported a heavy U bit which was
 capable of a leverage sufficient to break the animal's jaw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex was proud of his outfit, but his face wore a frown?not there
 only on acount of his losses, but also by reason of his mission, for under
 all his finery beat a heart as black as any in the cow country. For months
 he had smothered hot hatred and he was now on his way to ease himself of
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He and Slim Travennes had once exchanged shots with Hopalong in Santa Fe,
 and the month which he had spent in bed was not pleasing, and from that
 encounter had sprung the hatred. That he had been in the wrong made no
 difference with him. Some months later he had learned of the death of
 Slim, and it was due to the same man. That Slim had again been in the
 wrong also made no difference, for he realized the fact and nothing else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lately he had been told of the death of Slippery Trendley and Deacon
 Rankin, and he accepted their passing as a personal affront. That they had
 been caught red-handed in cattle stealing of huge proportions and received
 only what was customary under the conditions formed no excuse in his mind
 for their passing. He was now on his way to attend the carnival at Muddy
 Wells, knowing that his enemy would be sure to be there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While passing through Las Cruces he met Porous Johnson and Silent Somes,
 who were thirsty and who proclaimed that fact, whereupon he relieved them
 of their torment and, looking forward to more treatment of a similar
 nature, they gladly accompanied him without asking why or where.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they left the town in their rear Tex turned in his saddle and surveyed
 them with a cynical smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have yu heard anything of Trendley?" He asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They shook their heads.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Him an' th' Deacon was killed over in th' Panhandle," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" chorused the pair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jack Dorman, Shorty Danvers, Charley Teale, Stiffhat Bailey, Billy
 Jackson, Terry Nolan an' Sailor Carson was lynched."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" they shouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fish O'Brien, Pinochle Schmidt, Tom Wilkins, Apache Gordon, Charley of
 th' Bar Y, Penobscot Hughes an' about twenty others died fightin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Porous looked his astonishment: "Cavalry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' I'm going after th' dogs who did it," he continued, ignoring the
 question. "Are yu with me??Yu used to pal with some of them, didn't
 yu?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We did, an' we're shore with yu!" cried Porous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore right," endorsed Silent. "But who done it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That gang what's punchin' for th' Bar-20-Hopalong Cassidy is th' one I'm
 pining for. Yu fellers can take care of Peters an' Connors."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two stiffened and exchanged glances of uncertainty and apprehension.
 The outfit of the Bar-20 was too well known to cause exuberant joy to
 spring from the idea of war with it, and well in the center of all the
 tales concerning it were the persons Tex had named. To deliberately set
 forth with the avowed intention of planting these was not at all
 calculated to induce sweet dreams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex sneered his contempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yore shore uneasy: yu ain't a-scared, are yu?" He drawled. Porous relaxed
 and made a show of subduing his horse: "I reckon I ain't scared plumb to
 death. Yu can deal me a hand," he asserted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll draw cards too," hastily announced Silent, buttoning his vest. "Tell
 us about that jamboree over in th' Panhandle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex repeated the story as he had heard it from a bibulous member of the
 Barred Horseshoe, and then added a little of torture as a sauce to whet
 their appetites for revenge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How did Trendley cash in?" Asked Porous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody knows except that bum from th' Tin-Cup. I'll get him later. I'd a
 got Cassidy up in Santa Fe, too, if it wasn't for th' sun in my eyes. Me
 an' Slim loosened up on him in th' Plaza, but we couldn't see nothing with
 him a-standin' against th' sun."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's Slim now?" Asked Porous. "I ain't seen him for some time."

 <p>
 "Slim's with Trendley," replied Tex. "Cassidy handed him over to St. Pete
 at Cactus Springs. Him an' Connors sicked their outfit on him an' his
 vigilantes, bein helped some by th' O-Bar-O. They wiped th' town plumb off
 th' earth, an' now I'm going to do some wipin' of my own account. I'll
 prune that gang of some of its blossoms afore long. It's cost me seventeen
 friends so far, an' I'm going to stop th' leak, or make another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They entered Muddy Wells at sunrise on the day of the carnival and, eating
 a hearty breakfast, sallied forth to do their share toward making the
 festivities a success.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first step considered necessary for the acquirement of case and polish
 was begun at the nearest bar, and Tex, being the host, was so liberal that
 his friends had reached a most auspicious state when they followed him to
 Tom Lee's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex was too wise to lose his head through drink and had taken only enough
 to make him careless of consequences. Porous was determined to sing "Annie
 Laurie," although he hung on the last word of the first line until out of
 breath and then began anew. Silent, not wishing to be outdone, bawled at
 the top of his lungs a medley of music-hall words to the air of a hymn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex, walking as awkwardly as any cow-puncher, approached Tom Lee's, his
 two friends trailing erratically, arm in arm, in his rear. Swinging his
 arm he struck the door a resounding blow and entered, hand on gun, as it
 crashed back. Porous and Silent stood in the doorway and quarreled as to
 what each should drink and, compromising, lurched in and seated themselves
 on a table and resumed their vocal perpetrations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tex swaggered over to the bar and tossed a quarter upon it: "Corn juice,"
 he laconically exclaimed. Tossing off the liquor and glancing at his
 howling friends, he shrugged his shoulders and strode out by the rear
 door, slamming it after him. Porous and Silent, recounting friends who had
 "cashed in" fell to weeping and they were thus occupied when Hopalong and
 Buck entered, closely followed by the rest of the outfit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck walked to the bar and was followed by Hopalong, who declined his
 foreman's offer to treat. Tom Lee set a bottle at Buck's elbow and placed
 his hands against the bar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Friend of yourn just hit the back trail," he remarked to Hopalong. "He
 was primed some for trouble, too," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yaas?" Drawled Hopalong with little interest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The proprietor restacked the few glasses and wiped off the bar. "Them's
 his pardners," he said, indicating the pair on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong turned his head and gravely scrutinized them. Porous was
 bemoaning the death of Slim Travennes and Hopalong frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't reckon he's no relation of mine," he grunted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he ain't yore sister," replied Tom Lee, grinning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's his brand?" Asked the puncher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon he's a maverick, 'though yu put yore brand on him up to Santa Fe
 a couple of years back. Since he's throwed back on yore range I reckon
 he's yourn if yu wants him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon Tex is some sore," remarked Hopalong, rolling a cigarette.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon he is," replied the proprietor, tossing Buck's quarter in the
 cash box. "But, say, you should oughter see his rig."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yaas?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's shore a cow-punch dude?my, but he's some sumptious an'
 highfalutin'. An' bad? Why, he reckons th' Lord never brewed a more
 high-toned brand of cussedness than his'n. He shore reckons he's the
 baddest man that ever simmered."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd he look as th' leadin' man in a necktie festival?" Blazed Johnny
 from across the room, feeling called upon to help the conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'd be a howlin' success, son," replied Skinny Thompson, "judgin' by his
 friends what we elevated over in th' Panhandle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lanky Smith leaned forward with his elbow on the table, resting his chin
 in the palm of his hand: "Is Ewalt still a-layin' for yu, Hopalong?" He
 asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong turned wearily and tossed his half-consumed cigarette into the
 box of sand which did duty as a cuspidore: "I reckon so; an' he shore can
 hatch whenever he gets good an ready, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's probably a-broodin' over past grievances," offered Johnny, as he
 suddenly pushed Lanky's elbow from the table, nearly causing a
 catastrophe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yu'll be broodin' over present grievances if yu don't look out, yu
 everlastin' nuisance yu," growled Lanky, planting his elbow in its former
 position with an emphasis which conveyed a warning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These bantams ruflle my feathers," remarked Red. "They go around braggin'
 about th' egg they're goin' to lay an' do enough cacklin' to furnish music
 for a dozen. Then when th' affair comes off yu'll generally find they's
 been settin' on a door-knob."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu ever see a hen leave th' walks of peace an' bugs an' rustle
 hell-bent across th' trail plumb in front of a cayuse?" Asked Buck.
 "They'll leave off rustlin' grub an' become candidates for th' graveyard
 just for cussedness. Well, a whole lot of men are th' same way. How many
 times have I seen them swagger into a gin shop an' try to run things
 sudden an' hard, an' that with half a dozen better men in th' same room?
 There's shore a-plenty of trouble a-comin' to every man without rustlin'
 around for more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Member that time yu an' Frenchy tried to run th' little town of Frozen
 Nose, up in Montana?" Asked Johnny, winking at the rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An' we did run it, for a while," responded Buck. "But that only goes to
 show that most young men are chumps?we were just about yore age
 then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red laughed at the youngster's discomfiture: "That little squib of yourn
 shore touched her off?I reckon we irrigates on yu this time, don't
 we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' more th' Kid talks, th' more money he needs," remarked Lanky, placing
 his glass on the bar. "He had to blow me an' Skinny twice last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got two more after yu left," added Skinny "He shore oughter practice
 keeping still."
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">At one o'clock sharp Hopalong walked up to the clerk of the hotel and
grinned. The clerk looked up:

 "Hullo, Cassidy?" He exclaimed, genially. "What was all that fuss
about this mornin' when I was away? I haven't seen you for a long time,
have I? How are you?"
</pre>
 <p>
 "That fuss was a fool joke of Buck's, an' I wish they had been throwed
 out," Hopalong replied. "What I want to know is if Miss Deane is in her
 room. Yu see, I have a date with her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clerk grinned:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So she's roped you, too, has she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do yu mean?" Asked Hopalong in surprise. "Well, well," laughed the
 clerk. "You punchers are easy. Any third-rate actress that looks good to
 eat can rope you fellows, all right. Now look here, Laura, you keep shy of
 her corral, or you'll be broke so quick you won't believe you ever had a
 cent: that's straight. This is the third year that she's been here and I
 know what I'm talking about. How did you come to meet her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong explained the meeting and his friend laughed again:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, she knows this country like a book. She can't get lost anywhere
 around here. But she's blame clever at catching punchers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I reckon I'd better take her, go broke or not," replied Hopalong.
 "Is she in her room?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is, but she is not alone," responded the clerk. "There is a dude
 puncher up there with her and she left word here that she was indisposed,
 which means that you are outlawed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is he?" Asked Hopalong, having his suspicions. "That friend of yours:
 Ewalt. He sported a wad this morning when she passed him, and she let him
 make her acquaintance. He's another easy mark. He'll be busted wide open
 to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon I'll see Tex," suggested Hopalong, starting for the stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come back, you chump!" cried the clerk. "I don't want any shooting here.
 What do you care about it? Let her have him, for it's an easy way out of
 it for you. Let him think he's cut you out, for he'll spend all the more
 freely. Get your crowd and enlighten them?it'll be better than a
 circus. This may sound like a steer, but it's straight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong thought for a minute and then leaned on the cigar case:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon I'll take about a dozen of yore very best cigars, Charley. Got
 any real high-toned brands?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cortez panatella?two for a simoleon," Chancy replied. "But, seein'
 that it's you, I'll throw off a dollar on a dozen. They're a fool notion
 of the old man, for we can't sell one in a month."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong dug up a handful and threw one on the counter, lighting another:
 "Yu light a Cortez panatella with me," he said, pocketing the remainder.
 "That's five simoleons she didn't get. So long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He journeyed to Tom Lee's and found his outfit making merry. Passing
 around his cigars he leaned against the bar and delighted in the first
 really good smoke he had since he came home from Kansas City.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny Nelson blew a cloud of smoke at the ceiling and paused with a
 pleased expression on his face:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is a lalapoloosa of a cigar," he cried. "Where'd yu get it, an' how
 many's left?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got it from Charley, an' there's more than yu can buy at fifty a shot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll just take a few for luck," Johnny responded, running out into
 the street. Returning in five minutes with both hands full of cigars he
 passed them around and grinned: "They're birds, all right!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hopalong smiled, turned to Buck and related his conversation with Chancy.
 "What do yu think of that?" He asked as he finished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think Charley oughter be yore guardian," replied the foreman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was," replied Hopalong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If we sees Tex we'll all grin hard," laughed Red, making for the door.
 "Come on to th' contests?Lanky's gone already."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Muddy Wells streamed to the carnival grounds and relieved itself of its
 enthusiasm and money at the booths on the way. Cow-punchers rubbed elbows
 with Indians and Mexicans, and the few tourists that were present were
 delighted with the picturesque scene. The town was full of fakirs and
 before one of them stood a group of cow-punchers, apparently drinking in
 the words of a barker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right this way, gents, and see the woman who don't eat. Lived for two
 years without food, gents. Right this way, gents. Only a quarter of a
 dollar. Get your tickets, gents, and see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red pushed forward:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did yu say, pard?" He asked. "I'm a little off in my near ear.
 What's that about eatin' a woman for two years?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The greatest wonder of the age, gents. The wom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any discount for th' gang?" Asked Buck, gawking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't yu quit smokin' an' buy th' lady a meal?" Asked Johnny from the
 center of the group.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Th' cane yu ring th' cane yu get!" came from the other side of the street
 and Hopalong purchased rings for the outfit. Twenty-four rings got one
 cane, and it was divided between them as they wended their way toward the
 grounds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That makes six wheels she didn't get," murmured Hopalong. As they passed
 the snake charmer's booth they saw Tex and his companion ahead of them in
 the crowd, and they grinned broadly. "I like th' front row in th'
 balcony," remarked Johnny, who had been to Kansas City. "Don't cry in th'
 second act?it ain't real," laughed Red. "We'll hang John Brown on a
 sour appletree?in th' Panhandle," sang Skinny as they passed them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arriving at the grounds they hunted up the registration committee and
 entered in the contests. As Hopalong signed for the revolver competition
 he was rudely pushed aside and Tex wrote his name under that of his enemy.
 Hopalong was about to show quick resentment for the insult, but thought of
 what Charley had said, and he grinned sympathetically. The seats were
 filling rapidly, and the outfit went along the ground looking for friends.
 A bugle sounded and a hush swept over the crowd as the announcement was
 made for the first event.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Broncho-busting-Red Devil, never ridden: Frenchy McAllister, Tin-Cup,
 Montana; Meteor, killed his man: Skinny Thompson, Bar-20, Texas; Vixen,
 never ridden: Lefty Allen, O-Bar-O, Texas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All eyes were focused on the plain where the horse was being led out for
 the first trial. After the usual preliminaries had been gone through
 Frenchy walked over to it, vaulted in the saddle and the bandage was torn
 from the animal's eyes. For ten minutes the onlookers were held spellbound
 by the fight before them, and then the horse kicked and galloped away and
 Frenchy was picked up and carried from the field.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too bad!" cried Buck, running from the outfit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did yu see it?" asked Johnny excitedly, "Th' cinch busted." Another horse
 was led out and Skinny Thompson vaulted to the saddle, and after a fight
 of half an hour rode the animal from the enclosure to the clamorous shouts
 of his friends. Lefty Allen also rode his mount from the same gate, but
 took ten minutes more in which to do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The announcer conferred with the timekeepers and then stepped forward:
 "First, Skinny Thompson, Bar-20, thirty minutes and ten seconds; second,
 Lefty Allen, O-Bar-O, forty minutes and seven seconds."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Skinny returned to his friends shamefacedly and did not look as if he had
 just won a championship. They made way for him, and Johnny, who could not
 restrain his enthusiasm pounded him on the back and cried: "Yu old
 son-of-a-gun!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The announcer again came forward and gave out the competitors for the next
 contest, steer-roping and tying. Lanky Smith arose and, coiling his rope
 carefully, disappeared into the crowd. The fun was not so great in this,
 but when he returned to his outfit with the phenomenal time of six minutes
 and eight seconds for his string of ten steers, with twenty-two seconds
 for one of them, they gave him vociferous greeting. Three of his steers
 had gotten up after he had leaped from his saddle to tie them, but his
 horse had taken care of that. His nearest rival was one minute over him
 and Lanky retained the championship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red Connors shot with such accuracy in the rifle contest as to run his
 points twenty per cent higher than Waffles, of the O-Bar-O, and won the
 new rifle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The main interest centered in the revolver contest, for it was known that
 the present champion was to defend his title against an enemy and fears
 were expressed in the crowd that there would be an "accident." Buck Peters
 and Red stood just behind the firing line with their hands on hips, and
 Tex, seeing the precautions, smiled grimly as he advanced to the line.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Six bottles, with their necks an inch above a board, stood twenty paces
 from him, and he broke them all in as many shots, taking twelve seconds in
 which to do it. Hopalong followed him and tied the score. Three tin balls
 rolling erratically in a blanket supported by two men were sent flying
 into the air in four shots, Tex taking six seconds. His competitor sent
 them from the blanket in three shots and in the same time. In slow
 shooting from sights Tex passed his rival in points and stood to win.
 There was but one more event to be contested and in it Hopalong found his
 joy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shooting from the hip when the draw is timed is not the sport of even good
 shots, and when Tex made sixty points out of a possible hundred, he felt
 that he had shot well. When Hopalong went to the line his friends knew
 that they would now see shooting such as would be almost unbelievable,
 that the best draw-and-shoot marksman in their State was the man who
 limped slightly as he advanced and who chewed reflectively on his
 fifty-cent cigar. He wore two guns and he stepped with confidence before
 the marshal of the town, who was also judge of the contest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The iron ball which lay on the ground was small enough for the use of a
 rifle and could hardly be seen from the rear seats of the amphitheater.
 There was a word spoken by the timekeeper, and a gloved hand flashed down
 and up, and the ball danced and spun and leaped and rolled as shot after
 shot followed it with a precision and speed which brought the audience to
 a heavy silence. Taking the gun which Buck tossed to him and throwing it
 into the empty holster, he awaited the signal, and then smoke poured from
 his hips and the ball jumped continuously. Both guns emptied in the
 two-hand shooting, he wheeled and jerked loose the guns which the marshal
 wore, spinning around without a pause, the target hardly ceasing in its
 rolling. Under his arms he shot, backward and between his legs; leaping
 from side to side, ducking and dodging, following the ball wherever it
 went. Reloading the weapons quickly, he stepped forward and followed the
 ball until once more his guns were empty. Then he turned and walked back
 to the side of the marshal, smiling a little. His friends, and there were
 many in the crowd, torn from their affected nonchalance by shooting the
 like of which they had not attributed even to him, roared and shouted and
 danced in a frenzy of delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red also threw his guns to Hopalong, who caught them in the air and
 turning, faced Tex, who stood white of face and completely lost in the
 forgetfulness of admiration and amazement. The guns jerked again and a
 button flew from the buckskin shirt of his enemy; another tore a flower
 from his breast and another drove it into the ground at his feet as others
 stirred his hair and cut the buckle off his pretty sombrero. Tex, dazed,
 but wise enough to stand quiet, felt his belt tear loose and drop to his
 feet, felt a spur rip from its strap and saw his cigarette leap from his
 lips. Throwing the guns to Red, Hopalong laughed and abruptly turned and
 was lost in the crowd.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For several seconds there was silence, but when the dazed minds realized
 what their eyes had seen, there arose a roar which shook the houses in the
 town. Roar after roar thundered forth and was sent crashing back again by
 the distant walls, sweeping down on the discomfited dude and causing him
 to slink into the crowd to find a place less conspicuous. He was white yet
 and keen fear gripped his heart as he realized that he had come to the
 carnival with the expressed purpose of killing his enemy in fair combat.
 The whole town knew it, for he had taken pains to spread the news.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The woman he had been with knew it from words which she had overheard
 while on her way to the grounds with him. His friends knew it and would
 laugh him into forgetfulness as the fool who boasted. Now he understood
 why he had lost so many friends: they had attempted what he had sworn to
 attempt. Look where he would he could see only a smoke-wrapped demon who
 moved and shot with a speed incredible. There was reason why Slim had
 died. There was reason why Porous and Silent had paled when they learned
 of their mission.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hated his conspicuous clothes and his pretty broncho, and the woman who
 had gotten him to squander his money, and who was doubtless convulsed with
 laughter at his expense. He worked himself into a passion which knew no
 fear and he ran for the streets of the town, there to make good his boast
 or to die. When he found his enemy he felt himself grasped with a grip of
 steel and Buck Peters swung him around and grinned maliciously in his
 face:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You plaything!" hoarsely whispered the foreman. "Why don't yu get away
 while yu can? Why do yu want to throw yoreself against certain death? I
 don't want my pleasure marred by a murder, an' that is what it will be if
 yu makes a gun-play at Hopalong. He'll shoot yu as he did yore buttons.
 Take yore pretty clothes an' yore pretty cayuse an' go where this is not
 known, an' if ever again yu feels like killing Hopalong, get drunk an'
 forget it."

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in comp
