 <p>
 In the middle of the broad, fertile plain that stretches away in the
 direction of the Rhine, a mile and a quarter from Mulhausen, the camp was
 pitched. In the fitful light of the overcast August day, beneath the
 lowering sky that was filled with heavy drifting clouds, the long lines of
 squat white shelter-tents seemed to cower closer to the ground, and the
 muskets, stacked at regular intervals along the regimental fronts, made
 little spots of brightness, while over all the sentries with loaded pieces
 kept watch and ward, motionless as statues, straining their eyes to pierce
 the purplish mists that lay on the horizon and showed where the mighty
 river ran.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was about five o'clock when they had come in from Belfort; it was now
 eight, and the men had only just received their rations. There could be no
 distribution of wood, however, the wagons having gone astray, and it had
 therefore been impossible for them to make fires and warm their soup. They
 had consequently been obliged to content themselves as best they might,
 washing down their dry hard-tack with copious draughts of brandy, a
 proceeding that was not calculated greatly to help their tired legs after
 their long march. Near the canteen, however, behind the stacks of muskets,
 there were two soldiers pertinaciously endeavoring to elicit a blaze from
 a small pile of green wood, the trunks of some small trees that they had
 chopped down with their sword-bayonets, and that were obstinately
 determined not to burn. The cloud of thick, black smoke, rising slowly in
 the evening air, added to the general cheerlessness of the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
 There were but twelve thousand men there, all of the 7th corps that the
 general, Felix Douay, had with him at the time. The 1st division had been
 ordered to Froeschwiller the day before; the 3d was still at Lyons, and it
 had been decided to leave Belfort and hurry to the front with the 2d
 division, the reserve artillery, and an incomplete division of cavalry.
 Fires had been seen at Lorrach. The <i>sous-prefet</i> at Schelestadt had
 sent a telegram announcing that the Prussians were preparing to pass the
 Rhine at Markolsheim. The general did not like his unsupported position on
 the extreme right, where he was cut off from communication with the other
 corps, and his movement in the direction of the frontier had been
 accelerated by the intelligence he had received the day before of the
 disastrous surprise at Wissembourg. Even if he should not be called on to
 face the enemy on his own front, he felt that he was likely at any moment
 to be ordered to march to the relief of the 1st corps. There must be
 fighting going on, away down the river near Froeschwiller, on that dark
 and threatening Saturday, that ominous 6th of August; there was
 premonition of it in the sultry air, and the stray puffs of wind passed
 shudderingly over the camp as if fraught with tidings of impending evil.
 And for two days the division had believed that it was marching forth to
 battle; the men had expected to find the Prussians in their front, at the
 termination of their forced march from Belfort to Mulhausen.
 </p>
 <p>
 The day was drawing to an end, and from a remote corner of the camp the
 rattling drums and the shrill bugles sounded retreat, the sound dying away
 faintly in the distance on the still air of evening. Jean Macquart, who
 had been securing the tent and driving the pegs home, rose to his feet.
 When it began to be rumored that there was to be war he had left Rognes,
 the scene of the bloody drama in which he had lost his wife, Francoise and
 the acres that she brought him; he had re-enlisted at the age of
 thirty-nine, and been assigned to the 106th of the line, of which they
 were at that time filling up the <i>cadres</i>, with his old rank of
 corporal, and there were moments when he could not help wondering how it
 ever came about that he, who after Solferino had been so glad to quit the
 service and cease endangering his own and other people's lives, was again
 wearing the <i>capote</i> of the infantry man. But what is a man to do,
 when he has neither trade nor calling, neither wife, house, nor home, and
 his heart is heavy with mingled rage and sorrow? As well go and have a
 shot at the enemy, if they come where they are not wanted. And he
 remembered his old battle cry: Ah! <i>bon sang</i>! if he had no longer
 heart for honest toil, he would go and defend her, his country, the old
 land of France!
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean was on his legs he cast a look about the camp, where the summons
 of the drums and bugles, taken up by one command after another, produced a
 momentary bustle, the conclusion of the business of the day. Some men were
 running to take their places in the ranks, while others, already half
 asleep, arose and stretched their stiff limbs with an air of exasperated
 weariness. He stood waiting patiently for roll-call, with that cheerful
 imperturbability and determination to make the best of everything that
 made him the good soldier that he was. His comrades were accustomed to say
 of him that if he had only had education he would have made his mark. He
 could just barely read and write, and his aspirations did not rise even so
 high as to a sergeantcy. Once a peasant, always a peasant.
 </p>
 <p>
 But he found something to interest him in the fire of green wood that was
 still smoldering and sending up dense volumes of smoke, and he stepped up
 to speak to the two men who were busying themselves over it, Loubet and
 Lapoulle, both members of his squad.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Quit that! You are stifling the whole camp."
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet, a lean, active fellow and something of a wag, replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It will burn, corporal; I assure you it will&mdash;why don't you blow,
 you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And by way of encouragement he bestowed a kick on Lapoulle, a colossus of
 a man, who was on his knees puffing away with might and main, his cheeks
 distended till they were like wine-skins, his face red and swollen, and
 his eyes starting from their orbits and streaming with tears. Two other
 men of the squad, Chouteau and Pache, the former stretched at length upon
 his back like a man who appreciates the delight of idleness, and the
 latter engrossed in the occupation of putting a patch on his trousers,
 laughed long and loud at the ridiculous expression on the face of their
 comrade, the brutish Lapoulle.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean did not interfere to check their merriment. Perhaps the time was at
 hand when they would not have much occasion for laughter, and he, with all
 his seriousness and his humdrum, literal way of taking things, did not
 consider that it was part of his duty to be melancholy, preferring rather
 to close his eyes or look the other way when his men were enjoying
 themselves. But his attention was attracted to a second group not far
 away, another soldier of his squad, Maurice Levasseur, who had been
 conversing earnestly for near an hour with a civilian, a red-haired
 gentleman who was apparently about thirty-six years old, with an
 intelligent, honest face, illuminated by a pair of big protruding blue
 eyes, evidently the eyes of a near-sighted man. They had been joined by an
 artilleryman, a quartermaster-sergeant from the reserves, a knowing,
 self-satisfied-looking person with brown mustache and imperial, and the
 three stood talking like old friends, unmindful of what was going on about
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the kindness of his heart, in order to save them a reprimand, if not
 something worse, Jean stepped up to them and said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You had better be going, sir. It is past retreat, and if the lieutenant
 should see you&mdash;" Maurice did not permit him to conclude his
 sentence:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Stay where you are, Weiss," he said, and turning to the corporal, curtly
 added: "This gentleman is my brother-in-law. He has a pass from the
 colonel, who is acquainted with him."
 </p>
 <p>
 What business had he to interfere with other people's affairs, that
 peasant whose hands were still reeking of the manure-heap? <i>He</i> was a
 lawyer, had been admitted to the bar the preceding autumn, had enlisted as
 a volunteer and been received into the 106th without the formality of
 passing through the recruiting station, thanks to the favor of the
 colonel; it was true that he had condescended to carry a musket, but from
 the very start he had been conscious of a feeling of aversion and
 rebellion toward that ignorant clown under whose command he was.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well," Jean tranquilly replied; "don't blame me if your friend finds
 his way to the guardhouse."
 </p>
 <p>
 Thereon he turned and went away, assured that Maurice had not been lying,
 for the colonel, M. de Vineuil, with his commanding, high-bred manner and
 thick white mustache bisecting his long yellow face, passed by just then
 and saluted Weiss and the soldier with a smile. The colonel pursued his
 way at a good round pace toward a farmhouse that was visible off to the
 right among the plum trees, a few hundred feet away, where the staff had
 taken up their quarters for the night. No one could say whether the
 general commanding the 7th corps was there or not; he was in deep
 affliction on account of the death of his brother, slain in the action at
 Wissembourg. The brigadier, however, Bourgain-Desfeuilles, in whose
 command the 106th was, was certain to be there, brawling as loud as ever,
 and trundling his fat body about on his short, pudgy legs, with his red
 nose and rubicund face, vouchers for the good dinners he had eaten, and
 not likely ever to become top-heavy by reason of excessive weight in his
 upper story. There was a stir and movement about the farmhouse that seemed
 to be momentarily increasing; couriers and orderlies were arriving and
 departing every minute; they were awaiting there, with feverish anxiety of
 impatience, the belated dispatches which should advise them of the result
 of the battle that everyone, all that long August day, had felt to be
 imminent. Where had it been fought? what had been the issue? As night
 closed in and darkness shrouded the scene, a foreboding sense of calamity
 seemed to settle down upon the orchard, upon the scattered stacks of grain
 about the stables, and spread, and envelop them in waves of inky
 blackness. It was said, also, that a Prussian spy had been caught roaming
 about the camp, and that he had been taken to the house to be examined by
 the general. Perhaps Colonel de Vineuil had received a telegram of some
 kind, that he was in such great haste.
 </p>
 <p>
 Meantime Maurice had resumed his conversation with his brother-in-law
 Weiss and his cousin Honore Fouchard, the quartermaster-sergeant. Retreat,
 commencing in the remote distance, then gradually swelling in volume as it
 drew near with its blare and rattle, reached them, passed them, and died
 away in the solemn stillness of the twilight; they seemed to be quite
 unconscious of it. The young man was grandson to a hero of the Grand Army,
 and had first seen the light at Chene-Populeux, where his father, not
 caring to tread the path of glory, had held an ill-paid position as
 collector of taxes. His mother, a peasant, had died in giving him birth,
 him and his twin sister Henriette, who at an early age had become a second
 mother to him, and that he was now what he was, a private in the ranks,
 was owing entirely to his own imprudence, the headlong dissipation of a
 weak and enthusiastic nature, his money squandered and his substance
 wasted on women, cards, the thousand follies of the all-devouring
 minotaur, Paris, when he had concluded his law studies there and his
 relatives had impoverished themselves to make a gentleman of him. His
 conduct had brought his father to the grave; his sister, when he had
 stripped her of her little all, had been so fortunate as to find a husband
 in that excellent young fellow Weiss, who had long held the position of
 accountant in the great sugar refinery at Chene-Populeux, and was now
 foreman for M. Delaherche, one of the chief cloth manufacturers of Sedan.
 And Maurice, always cheered and encouraged when he saw a prospect of
 amendment in himself, and equally disheartened when his good resolves
 failed him and he relapsed, generous and enthusiastic but without
 steadiness of purpose, a weathercock that shifted with every varying
 breath of impulse, now believed that experience had done its work and
 taught him the error of his ways. He was a small, light-complexioned man,
 with a high, well-developed forehead, small nose, and retreating chin, and
 a pair of attractive gray eyes in a face that indicated intelligence;
 there were times when his mind seemed to lack balance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss, on the eve of the commencement of hostilities, had found that there
 were family matters that made it necessary for him to visit Mulhausen, and
 had made a hurried trip to that city. That he had been able to employ the
 good offices of Colonel de Vineuil to afford him an opportunity of shaking
 hands with his brother-in-law was owing to the circumstance that that
 officer was own uncle to young Mme. Delaherche, a pretty young widow whom
 the cloth manufacturer had married the year previous, and whom Maurice and
 Henriette, thanks to their being neighbors, had known as a girl. In
 addition to the colonel, moreover, Maurice had discovered that the captain
 of his company, Beaudoin, was an acquaintance of Gilberte, Delaherche's
 young wife; report even had it that she and the captain had been on terms
 of intimacy in the days when she was Mme. Maginot, living at Meziere, wife
 of M. Maginot, the timber inspector.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give Henriette a good kiss for me, Weiss," said the young man, who loved
 his sister passionately. "Tell her that she shall have no reason to
 complain of me, that I wish her to be proud of her brother."
 </p>
 <p>
 Tears rose to his eyes at the remembrance of his misdeeds. The
 brother-in-law, who was also deeply affected, ended the painful scene by
 turning to Honore Fouchard, the artilleryman.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The first time I am anywhere in the neighborhood," he said, "I will run
 up to Remilly and tell Uncle Fouchard that I saw you and that you are
 well."
 </p>
 <p>
 Uncle Fouchard, a peasant, who owned a bit of land and plied the trade of
 itinerant butcher, serving his customers from a cart, was a brother of
 Henriette's and Maurice's mother. He lived at Remilly, in a house perched
 upon a high hill, about four miles from Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good!" Honore calmly answered; "the father don't worry his head a great
 deal on my account, but go there all the same if you feel inclined."
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment there was a movement over in the direction of the
 farmhouse, and they beheld the straggler, the man who had been arrested as
 a spy, come forth, free, accompanied only by a single officer. He had
 likely had papers to show, or had trumped up a story of some kind, for
 they were simply expelling him from the camp. In the darkening twilight,
 and at the distance they were, they could not make him out distinctly,
 only a big, square-shouldered fellow with a rough shock of reddish hair.
 And yet Maurice gave vent to an exclamation of surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Honore! look there. If one wouldn't swear he was the Prussian&mdash;you
 know, Goliah!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The name made the artilleryman start as if he had been shot; he strained
 his blazing eyes to follow the receding shape. Goliah Steinberg, the
 journeyman butcher, the man who had set him and his father by the ears,
 who had stolen from him his Silvine; the whole base, dirty, miserable
 story, from which he had not yet ceased to suffer! He would have run
 after, would have caught him by the throat and strangled him, but the man
 had already crossed the line of stacked muskets, was moving off and
 vanishing in the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh!" he murmured, "Goliah! no, it can't be he. He is down yonder,
 fighting on the other side. If I ever come across him&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 He shook his fist with an air of menace at the dusky horizon, at the wide
 empurpled stretch of eastern sky that stood for Prussia in his eyes. No
 one spoke; they heard the strains of retreat again, but very distant now,
 away at the extreme end of the camp, blended and lost among the hum of
 other indistinguishable sounds.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Fichtre</i>!" exclaimed Honore, "I shall have the pleasure of sleeping
 on the soft side of a plank in the guard-house unless I make haste back to
 roll-call. Good-night&mdash;adieu, everybody!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And grasping Weiss by both his hands and giving them a hearty squeeze, he
 strode swiftly away toward the slight elevation where the guns of the
 reserves were parked, without again mentioning his father's name or
 sending any word to Silvine, whose name lay at the end of his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
 The minutes slipped away, and over toward the left, where the 2d brigade
 lay, a bugle sounded. Another, near at hand, replied, and then a third, in
 the remote distance, took up the strain. Presently there was a universal
 blaring, far and near, throughout the camp, whereon Gaude, the bugler of
 the company, took up his instrument. He was a tall, lank, beardless,
 melancholy youth, chary of his words, saving his breath for his calls,
 which he gave conscientiously, with the vigor of a young hurricane.
 </p>
 <p>
 Forthwith Sergeant Sapin, a ceremonious little man with large vague eyes,
 stepped forward and began to call the roll. He rattled off the names in a
 thin, piping voice, while the men, who had come up and ranged themselves
 in front of him, responded in accents of varying pitch, from the deep
 rumble of the violoncello to the shrill note of the piccolo. But there
 came a hitch in the proceedings.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lapoulle!" shouted the sergeant, calling the name a second time with
 increased emphasis.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no response, and Jean rushed off to the place where Private
 Lapoulle, egged on by his comrades, was industriously trying to fan the
 refractory fuel into a blaze; flat on his stomach before the pile of
 blackening, spluttering wood, his face resembling an underdone beefsteak,
 the warrior was now propelling dense clouds of smoke horizontally along
 the surface of the plain.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thunder and ouns! Quit that, will you!" yelled Jean, "and come and answer
 to your name."
 </p>
 <p>
 Lapoulle rose to his feet with a dazed look on his face, then appeared to
 grasp the situation and yelled: "Present!" in such stentorian tones that
 Loubet, pretending to be upset by the concussion, sank to the ground in a
 sitting posture. Pache had finished mending his trousers and answered in a
 voice that was barely audible, that sounded more like the mumbling of a
 prayer. Chouteau, not even troubling himself to rise, grunted his answer
 unconcernedly and turned over on his side.
 </p>
 <p>
 Lieutenant Rochas, the officer of the guard, was meantime standing a few
 steps away, motionlessly awaiting the conclusion of the ceremony. When
 Sergeant Sapin had finished calling the roll and came up to report that
 all were present, the officer, with a glance at Weiss, who was still
 conversing with Maurice, growled from under his mustache:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, and one over. What is that civilian doing here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "He has the colonel's pass, Lieutenant," explained Jean, who had heard the
 question.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas made no reply; he shrugged his shoulders disapprovingly and resumed
 his round among the company streets while waiting for taps to sound. Jean,
 stiff and sore after his day's march, went and sat down a little way from
 Maurice, whose murmured words fell indistinctly upon his unlistening ear,
 for he, too, had vague, half formed reflections of his own that were
 stirring sluggishly in the recesses of his muddy, torpid mind.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was a believer in war in the abstract; he considered it one of the
 necessary evils, essential to the very existence of nations. This was
 nothing more than the logical sequence of his course in embracing those
 theories of evolution which in those days exercised such a potent
 influence on our young men of intelligence and education. Is not life
 itself an unending battle? Does not all nature owe its being to a series
 of relentless conflicts, the survival of the fittest, the maintenance and
 renewal of force by unceasing activity; is not death a necessary condition
 to young and vigorous life? And he remembered the sensation of gladness
 that had filled his heart when first the thought occurred to him that he
 might expiate his errors by enlisting and defending his country on the
 frontier. It might be that France of the plebiscite, while giving itself
 over to the Emperor, had not desired war; he himself, only a week
 previously, had declared it to be a culpable and idiotic measure. There
 were long discussions concerning the right of a German prince to occupy
 the throne of Spain; as the question gradually became more and more
 intricate and muddled it seemed as if everyone must be wrong, no one
 right; so that it was impossible to tell from which side the provocation
 came, and the only part of the entire business that was clear to the eyes
 of all was the inevitable, the fatal law which at a given moment hurls
 nation against nation. Then Paris was convulsed from center to
 circumference; he remembered that burning summer's night, the tossing,
 struggling human tide that filled the boulevards, the bands of men
 brandishing torches before the Hotel de Ville, and yelling: "On to Berlin!
 on to Berlin!" and he seemed to hear the strains of the Marseillaise, sung
 by a beautiful, stately woman with the face of a queen, wrapped in the
 folds of a flag, from her elevation on the box of a coach. Was it all a
 lie, was it true that the heart of Paris had not beaten then? And then, as
 was always the case with him, that condition of nervous excitation had
 been succeeded by long hours of doubt and disgust; there were all the
 small annoyances of the soldier's life; his arrival at the barracks, his
 examination by the adjutant, the fitting of his uniform by the gruff
 sergeant, the malodorous bedroom with its fetid air and filthy floor, the
 horseplay and coarse language of his new comrades, the merciless drill
 that stiffened his limbs and benumbed his brain. In a week's time,
 however, he had conquered his first squeamishness, and from that time
 forth was comparatively contented with his lot; and when the regiment was
 at last ordered forward to Belfort the fever of enthusiasm had again taken
 possession of him.
 </p>
 <p>
 For the first few days after they took the field Maurice was convinced
 that their success was absolutely certain. The Emperor's plan appeared to
 him perfectly clear: he would advance four hundred thousand men to the
 left bank of the Rhine, pass the river before the Prussians had completed
 their preparations, separate northern and southern Germany by a vigorous
 inroad, and by means of a brilliant victory or two compel Austria and
 Italy to join hands immediately with France. Had there not been a
 short-lived rumor that that 7th corps of which his regiment formed a part
 was to be embarked at Brest and landed in Denmark, where it would create a
 diversion that would serve to neutralize one of the Prussian armies? They
 would be taken by surprise; the arrogant nation would be overrun in every
 direction and crushed utterly within a few brief weeks. It would be a
 military picnic, a holiday excursion from Strasbourg to Berlin. While they
 were lying inactive at Belfort, however, his former doubts and fears
 returned to him. To the 7th corps had been assigned the duty of guarding
 the entrance to the Black Forest; it had reached its position in a state
 of confusion that exceeded imagination, deficient in men, material,
 everything. The 3d division was in Italy; the 2d cavalry brigade had been
 halted at Lyons to check a threatened rising among the people there, and
 three batteries had straggled off in some direction&mdash;where, no one
 could say. Then their destitution in the way of stores and supplies was
 something wonderful; the depots at Belfort, which were to have furnished
 everything, were empty; not a sign of a tent, no mess-kettles, no flannel
 belts, no hospital supplies, no farriers' forges, not even a
 horse-shackle. The quartermaster's and medical departments were without
 trained assistants. At the very last moment it was discovered that thirty
 thousand rifles were practically useless owing to the absence of some
 small pin or other interchangeable mechanism about the breech-blocks, and
 the officer who posted off in hot haste to Paris succeeded with the
 greatest difficulty in securing five thousand of the missing implements.
 Their inactivity, again, was another matter that kept him on pins and
 needles; why did they idle away their time for two weeks? why did they not
 advance? He saw clearly that each day of delay was a mistake that could
 never be repaired, a chance of victory gone. And if the plan of campaign
 that he had dreamed of was clear and precise, its manner of execution was
 most lame and impotent, a fact of which he was to learn a great deal more
 later on and of which he had then only a faint and glimmering perception:
 the seven army corps dispersed along the extended frontier line <i>en
 echelon</i>, from Metz to Bitche and from Bitche to Belfort; the many
 regiments and squadrons that had been recruited up to only half-strength
 or less, so that the four hundred and thirty thousand men on paper melted
 away to two hundred and thirty thousand at the outside; the jealousies
 among the generals, each of whom thought only of securing for himself a
 marshal's baton, and gave no care to supporting his neighbor; the
 frightful lack of foresight, mobilization and concentration being carried
 on simultaneously in order to gain time, a process that resulted in
 confusion worse confounded; a system, in a word, of dry rot and slow
 paralysis, which, commencing with the head, with the Emperor himself,
 shattered in health and lacking in promptness of decision, could not fail
 ultimately to communicate itself to the whole army, disorganizing it and
 annihilating its efficiency, leading it into disaster from which it had
 not the means of extricating itself. And yet, over and above the dull
 misery of that period of waiting, in the intuitive, shuddering perception
 of what must infallibly happen, his certainty that they must be victors in
 the end remained unimpaired.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the 3d of August the cheerful news had been given to the public of the
 victory of Sarrebruck, fought and won the day before. It could scarcely be
 called a great victory, but the columns of the newspapers teemed with
 enthusiastic gush; the invasion of Germany was begun, it was the first
 step in their glorious march to triumph, and the little Prince Imperial,
 who had coolly stooped and picked up a bullet from the battlefield, then
 commenced to be celebrated in legend. Two days later, however, when
 intelligence came of the surprise and defeat at Wissembourg, every mouth
 was opened to emit a cry of rage and distress. That five thousand men,
 caught in a trap, had faced thirty-five thousand Prussians all one long
 summer day, that was not a circumstance to daunt the courage of anyone; it
 simply called for vengeance. Yes, the leaders had doubtless been culpably
 lacking in vigilance and were to be censured for their want of foresight,
 but that would soon be mended; MacMahon had sent for the 1st division of
 the 7th corps, the 1st corps would be supported by the 5th, and the
 Prussians must be across the Rhine again by that time, with the bayonets
 of our infantry at their backs to accelerate their movement. And so,
 beneath the deep, dim vault of heaven, the thought of the battle that must
 have raged that day, the feverish impatience with which the tidings were
 awaited, the horrible feeling of suspense that pervaded the air about
 them, spread from man to man and became each minute more tense and
 unendurable.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was just then saying to Weiss:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! we have certainly given them a righteous good drubbing to-day."
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss made no reply save to nod his head with an air of anxiety. His gaze
 was directed toward the Rhine, on that Orient region where now the night
 had settled down in earnest, like a wall of blackness, concealing strange
 forms and shapes of mystery. The concluding strains of the bugles for
 roll-call had been succeeded by a deep silence, which had descended upon
 the drowsy camp and was only broken now and then by the steps and voices
 of some wakeful soldiers. A light had been lit&mdash;it looked like a
 twinkling star&mdash;in the main room of the farmhouse where the staff,
 which is supposed never to sleep, was awaiting the telegrams that came in
 occasionally, though as yet they were undecided. And the green wood fire,
 now finally left to itself, was still emitting its funereal wreaths of
 dense black smoke, which drifted in the gentle breeze over the unsleeping
 farmhouse, obscuring the early stars in the heavens above.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A drubbing!" Weiss at last replied, "God grant it may be so!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, still seated a few steps away, pricked up his ears, while Lieutenant
 Rochas, noticing that the wish was attended by a doubt, stopped to listen.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What!" Maurice rejoined, "have you not confidence? can you believe that
 defeat is possible?"
 </p>
 <p>
 His brother-in-law silenced him with a gesture; his hands were trembling
 with agitation, his kindly pleasant face was pale and bore an expression
 of deep distress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Defeat, ah! Heaven preserve us from that! You know that I was born in
 this country; my grandfather and grandmother were murdered by the Cossacks
 in 1814, and whenever I think of invasion it makes me clench my fist and
 grit my teeth; I could go through fire and flood, like a trooper, in my
 shirt sleeves! Defeat&mdash;no, no! I cannot, I will not believe it
 possible."
 </p>
 <p>
 He became calmer, allowing his arms to fall by his side in discouragement.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But my mind is not easy, do you see. I know Alsace; I was born there; I
 am just off a business trip through the country, and we civilians have
 opportunities of seeing many things that the generals persist in ignoring,
 although they have them thrust beneath their very eyes. Ah, <i>we</i>
 wanted war with Prussia as badly as anyone; for a long, long time we have
 been waiting patiently for a chance to pay off old scores, but that did
 not prevent us from being on neighborly terms with the people in Baden and
 Bavaria; every one of us, almost, has friends or relatives across the
 Rhine. It was our belief that they felt like us and would not be sorry to
 humble the intolerable insolence of the Prussians. And now, after our long
 period of uncomplaining expectation, for the past two weeks we have seen
 things going from bad to worse, and it vexes and terrifies us. Since the
 declaration of war the enemy's horse have been suffered to come among us,
 terrorizing the villages, reconnoitering the country, cutting the
 telegraph wires. Baden and Bavaria are rising; immense bodies of troops
 are being concentrated in the Palatinate; information reaches us from
 every quarter, from the great fairs and markets, that our frontier is
 threatened, and when the citizens, the mayors of the communes, take the
 alarm at last and hurry off to tell your officers what they know, those
 gentlemen shrug their shoulders and reply: Those things spring from the
 imagination of cowards; there is no enemy near here. And when there is not
 an hour to lose, days and days are wasted. What are they waiting for? To
 give the whole German nation time to concentrate on the other bank of the
 river?"
 </p>
 <p>
 His words were uttered in a low, mournful, voice, as if he were reciting
 to himself a story that had long occupied his thoughts.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! Germany, I know her too well; and the terrible part of the business
 is that you soldiers seem to know no more about her than you do about
 China. You must remember my cousin Gunther, Maurice, the young man, who
 came to pay me a flying visit at Sedan last spring. His mother is a sister
 of my mother, and married a Berliner; the young man is a German out and
 out; he detests everything French. He is a captain in the 5th Prussian
 corps. I accompanied him to the railway station that night, and he said to
 me in his sharp, peremptory way: 'If France declares war on us, she will
 be soundly whipped!' I can hear his words ringing in my ears yet."
 </p>
 <p>
 Forthwith, Lieutenant Rochas, who had managed to contain himself until
 then, not without some difficulty, stepped forward in a towering rage. He
 was a tall, lean individual of about fifty, with a long, weather-beaten,
 and wrinkled face; his inordinately long nose, curved like the beak of a
 bird of prey, over a strong but well-shaped mouth, concealed by a thick,
 bristling mustache that was beginning to be touched with silver. And he
 shouted in a voice of thunder:
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, you, sir! what yarns are those that you are retailing to
 dishearten my men?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean did not interfere with his opinion, but he thought that the last
 speaker was right, for he, too, while beginning to be conscious of the
 protracted delay, and the general confusion in their affairs, had never
 had the slightest doubt about that terrible thrashing they were certain to
 give the Prussians. There could be no question about the matter, for was
 not that the reason of their being there?
 </p>
 <p>
 "But I am not trying to dishearten anyone, Lieutenant," Weiss answered in
 astonishment. "Quite the reverse; I am desirous that others should know
 what I know, because then they will be able to act with their eyes open.
 Look here! that Germany of which we were speaking&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went on in his clear, demonstrative way to explain the reason of
 his fears: how Prussia had increased her resources since Sadowa; how the
 national movement had placed her at the head of the other German states, a
 mighty empire in process of formation and rejuvenation, with the constant
 hope and desire for unity as the incentive to their irresistible efforts;
 the system of compulsory military service, which made them a nation of
 trained soldiers, provided with the most effective arms of modern
 invention, with generals who were masters in the art of strategy, proudly
 mindful still of the crushing defeat they had administered to Austria; the
 intelligence, the moral force that resided in that army, commanded as it
 was almost exclusively by young generals, who in turn looked up to a
 commander-in-chief who seemed destined to revolutionize the art of war,
 whose prudence and foresight were unparalleled, whose correctness of
 judgment was a thing to wonder at. And in contrast to that picture of
 Germany he pointed to France: the Empire sinking into senile decrepitude,
 sanctioned by the plebiscite, but rotten at its foundation, destroying
 liberty, and therein stifling every idea of patriotism, ready to give up
 the ghost as soon as it should cease to satisfy the unworthy appetites to
 which it had given birth; then there was the army, brave, it was true, as
 was to be expected from men of their race, and covered with Crimean and
 Italian laurels, but vitiated by the system that permitted men to purchase
 substitutes for a money consideration, abandoned to the antiquated methods
 of African routine, too confident of victory to keep abreast with the more
 perfect science of modern times; and, finally, the generals, men for the
 most part not above mediocrity, consumed by petty rivalries, some of them
 of an ignorance beyond all belief, and at their head the Emperor, an
 ailing, vacillating man, deceiving himself and everyone with whom he had
 dealings in that desperate venture on which they were embarking, into
 which they were all rushing blindfold, with no preparation worthy of the
 name, with the panic and confusion of a flock of sheep on its way to the
 shambles.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas stood listening, open-mouthed, and with staring eyes; his terrible
 nose dilated visibly. Then suddenly his lantern jaws parted to emit an
 obstreperous, Homeric peal of laughter.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What are you giving us there, you? what do you mean by all that silly
 lingo? Why, there is not the first word of sense in your whole harangue&mdash;it
 is too idiotic to deserve an answer. Go and tell those things to the
 recruits, but don't tell them to me; no! not to me, who have seen
 twenty-seven years of service."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he gave himself a thump on the breast with his doubled fist. He was
 the son of a master mason who had come from Limousin to Paris, where the
 son, not taking kindly to the paternal handicraft, had enlisted at the age
 of eighteen. He had been a soldier of fortune and had carried the
 knapsack, was corporal in Africa, sergeant in the Crimea, and after
 Solferino had been made lieutenant, having devoted fifteen years of
 laborious toil and heroic bravery to obtaining that rank, and was so
 illiterate that he had no chance of ever getting his captaincy.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You, sir, who think you know everything, let me tell you a thing you
 don't know. Yes, at Mazagran I was scarce nineteen years old, and there
 were twenty-three of us, not a living soul more, and for more than four
 days we held out against twelve thousand Arabs. Yes, indeed! for years and
 years, if you had only been with us out there in Africa, sir, at Mascara,
 at Biskra, at Dellys, after that in Grand Kabylia, after that again at
 Laghouat, you would have seen those dirty niggers run like deer as soon as
 we showed our faces. And at Sebastopol, sir, <i>fichtre</i>! you wouldn't
 have said it was the pleasantest place in the world. The wind blew fit to
 take a man's hair out by the roots, it was cold enough to freeze a brass
 monkey, and those beggars kept us on a continual dance with their feints
 and sorties. Never mind; we made them dance in the end; we danced them
 into the big hot frying pan, and to quick music, too! And Solferino, you
 were not there, sir! then why do you speak of it? Yes, at Solferino, where
 it was so hot, although I suppose more rain fell there that day than you
 have seen in your whole life, at Solferino, where we had our little brush
 with the Austrians, it would have warmed your heart to see how they
 vanished before our bayonets, riding one another down in their haste to
 get away from us, as if their coat tails were on fire!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He laughed the gay, ringing laugh of the daredevil French soldier; he
 seemed to expand and dilate with satisfaction. It was the old story: the
 French trooper going about the world with his girl on his arm and a glass
 of good wine in his hand; thrones upset and kingdoms conquered in the
 singing of a merry song. Given a corporal and four men, and great armies
 would bite the dust. His voice suddenly sank to a low, rumbling bass:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What! whip France? We, whipped by those Prussian pigs, we!" He came up to
 Weiss and grasped him violently by the lapel of his coat. His entire long
 frame, lean as that of the immortal Knight Errant, seemed to breathe
 defiance and unmitigated contempt for the foe, whoever he might be,
 regardless of time, place, or any other circumstance. "Listen to what I
 tell you, sir. If the Prussians dare to show their faces here, we will
 kick them home again. You hear me? we will kick them from here to Berlin."
 His bearing and manner were superb; the serene tranquillity of the child,
 the candid conviction of the innocent who knows nothing and fears nothing.
 "<i>Parbleu</i>! it is so, because it is so, and that's all there is about
 it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss, stunned and almost convinced, made haste to declare that he wished
 for nothing better. As for Maurice, who had prudently held his tongue, not
 venturing to express an opinion in presence of his superior officer, he
 concluded by joining in the other's merriment; he warmed the cockles of
 his heart, that devil of a man, whom he nevertheless considered rather
 stupid. Jean, too, had nodded his approval at every one of the
 lieutenant's assertions. He had also been at Solferino, where it rained so
 hard. And that showed what it was to have a tongue in one's head and know
 how to use it. If all the leaders had talked like that they would not be
 in such a mess, and there would be camp-kettles and flannel belts in
 abundance.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was quite dark by this time, and Rochas continued to gesticulate and
 brandish his long arms in the obscurity. His historical studies had been
 confined to a stray volume of Napoleonic memoirs that had found its way to
 his knapsack from a peddler's wagon. His excitement refused to be pacified
 and all his book-learning burst from his lips in a torrent of eloquence:
 </p>
 <p>
 "We flogged the Austrians at Castiglione, at Marengo, at Austerlitz, at
 Wagram; we flogged the Prussians at Eylau, at Jena, at Lutzen; we flogged
 the Russians at Friedland, at Smolensk and at the Moskowa; we flogged
 Spain and England everywhere; all creation flogged, flogged, flogged, up
 and down, far and near, at home and abroad, and now you tell me that it is
 we who are to take the flogging! Why, pray tell me? How? Is the world
 coming to an end?" He drew his tall form up higher still and raised his
 arm aloft, like the staff of a battle-flag. "Look you, there has been a
 fight to-day, down yonder, and we are waiting for the news. Well! I will
 tell you what the news is&mdash;I will tell you, I! We have flogged the
 Prussians, flogged them until they didn't know whether they were a-foot or
 a-horseback, flogged them to powder, so that they had to be swept up in
 small pieces!"
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment there passed over the camp, beneath the somber heavens, a
 loud, wailing cry. Was it the plaint of some nocturnal bird? Or was it a
 mysterious voice, reaching them from some far-distant field of carnage,
 ominous of disaster? The whole camp shuddered, lying there in the shadows,
 and the strained, tense sensation of expectant anxiety that hung,
 miasma-like, in the air became more strained, more feverish, as they
 waited for telegrams that seemed as if they would never come. In the
 distance, at the farmhouse, the candle that lighted the dreary watches of
 the staff burned up more brightly, with an erect, unflickering flame, as
 if it had been of wax instead of tallow.
 </p>
 <p>
 But it was ten o'clock, and Gaude, rising to his feet from the ground
 where he had been lost in the darkness, sounded taps, the first in all the
 camp. Other bugles, far and near, took up the strain, and it passed away
 in the distance with a dying, melancholy wail, as if the angel of slumber
 had already brushed with his wings the weary men. And Weiss, who had
 lingered there so late, embraced Maurice affectionately; courage, and
 hope! he would kiss Henriette for her brother and would have many things
 to tell uncle Fouchard when they met. Then, just as he was turning to go,
 a rumor began to circulate, accompanied by the wildest excitement. A great
 victory had been won by Marshal MacMahon, so the report ran; the Crown
 Prince of Prussia a prisoner, with twenty-five thousand men, the enemy's
 army repulsed and utterly destroyed, its guns and baggage abandoned to the
 victors.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Didn't I tell you so!" shouted Rochas, in his most thundering voice.
 Then, running after Weiss, who, light of heart, was hastening to get back
 to Mulhausen: "To Berlin, sir, and we'll kick them every step of the way!"
 </p>
 <p>
 A quarter of an hour later came another dispatch, announcing that the army
 had been compelled to evacuate Woerth and was retreating. Ah, what a night
 was that! Rochas, overpowered by sleep, wrapped his cloak about him, threw
 himself down on the bare ground, as he had done many a time before.
 Maurice and Jean sought the shelter of the tent, into which were crowded,
 a confused tangle of arms and legs, Loubet, Chouteau, Pache, and Lapoulle,
 their heads resting on their knapsacks. There was room for six, provided
 they were careful how they disposed of their legs. Loubet, by way of
 diverting his comrades and making them forget their hunger, had labored
 for some time to convince Lapoulle that there was to be a ration of
 poultry issued the next morning, but they were too sleepy to keep up the
 joke; they were snoring, and the Prussians might come, it was all one to
 them. Jean lay for a moment without stirring, pressing close against
 Maurice; notwithstanding his fatigue he was unable to sleep; he could not
 help thinking of the things that gentleman had said, how all Germany was
 up in arms and preparing to pour her devastating hordes across the Rhine;
 and he felt that his tent-mate was not sleeping, either&mdash;was thinking
 of the same things as he. Then the latter turned over impatiently and
 moved away, and the other understood that his presence was not agreeable.
 There was a lack of sympathy between the peasant and the man of culture,
 an enmity of caste and education that amounted almost to physical
 aversion. The former, however, experienced a sensation of shame and
 sadness at this condition of affairs; he shrinkingly drew in his limbs so
 as to occupy as small a space as possible, endeavoring to escape from the
 hostile scorn that he was vaguely conscious of in his neighbor. But
 although the night wind without had blown up chill, the crowded tent was
 so stifling hot and close that Maurice, in a fever of exasperation, raised
 the flap, darted out, and went and stretched himself on the ground a few
 steps away. That made Jean still more unhappy, and in his half-sleeping,
 half-waking condition he had troubled dreams, made up of a regretful
 feeling that no one cared for him, and a vague apprehension of impending
 calamity of which he seemed to hear the steps approaching with measured
 tread from the shadowy, mysterious depths of the unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two hours passed, and all the camp lay lifeless, motionless under the
 oppression of the deep, weird darkness, that was instinct with some
 dreadful horror as yet without a name. Out of the sea of blackness came
 stifled sighs and moans; from an invisible tent was heard something that
 sounded like the groan of a dying man, the fitful dream of some tired
 soldier. Then there were other sounds that to the strained ear lost their
 familiarity and became menaces of approaching evil; the neighing of a
 charger, the clank of a sword, the hurrying steps of some belated prowler.
 And all at once, off toward the canteens, a great light flamed up. The
 entire front was brilliantly illuminated; the long, regularly aligned
 array of stacks stood out against the darkness, and the ruddy blaze,
 reflected from the burnished barrels of the rifles, assumed the hue of
 new-shed blood; the erect, stern figures of the sentries became visible in
 the fiery glow. Could it be the enemy, whose presence the leaders had been
 talking of for the past two days, and on whose trail they had come out
 from Belfort to Mulhausen? Then a shower of sparks rose high in the air
 and the conflagration subsided. It was only the pile of green wood that
 had been so long the object of Loubet's and Lapoulle's care, and which,
 after having smoldered for many hours, had at last flashed up like a fire
 of straw.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, alarmed by the vivid light, hastily left the tent and was near
 falling over Maurice, who had raised himself on his elbow. The darkness
 seemed by contrast more opaque than it had been before, and the two men
 lay stretched on the bare ground, a few paces from each other. All that
 they could descry before them in the dense shadows of the night was the
 window of the farm-house, faintly illuminated by the dim candle, which
 shone with a sinister gleam, as if it were doing duty by the bedside of a
 corpse. What time was it? two o'clock, or three, perhaps. It was plain
 that the staff had not made acquaintance with their beds that night. They
 could hear Bourgain-Desfeuilles' loud, disputatious voice; the general was
 furious that his rest should be broken thus, and it required many cigars
 and toddies to pacify him. More telegrams came in; things must be going
 badly; silhouettes of couriers, faintly drawn against the uncertain sky
 line, could be descried, galloping madly. There was the sound of scuffling
 steps, imprecations, a smothered cry as of a man suddenly stricken down,
 followed by a blood-freezing silence. What could it be? Was it the end? A
 breath, chill and icy as that from the lips of death, had passed over the
 camp that lay lost in slumber and agonized expectation.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was at that moment that Jean and Maurice recognized in the tall, thin,
 spectral form that passed swiftly by, their colonel, de Vineuil. He was
 accompanied by the regimental surgeon, Major Bouroche, a large man with a
 leonine face They were conversing in broken, unfinished sentences,
 whisperingly, such a conversation as we sometimes hear in dreams.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It came by the way of Basle. Our 1st division all cut to pieces. The
 battle lasted twelve hours; the whole army is retreating&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel's specter halted and called by name another specter, which
 came lightly forward; it was an elegant ghost, faultless in uniform and
 equipment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is that you, Beaudoin?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, Colonel."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! bad news, my friend, terrible news! MacMahon beaten at Froeschwiller,
 Frossard beaten at Spickeren, and between them de Failly, held in check
 where he could give no assistance. At Froeschwiller it was a single corps
 against an entire army; they fought like heroes. It was a complete rout, a
 panic, and now France lies open to their advance&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 His tears choked further utterance, the words came from his lips
 unintelligible, and the three shadows vanished, swallowed up in the
 obscurity.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice rose to his feet; a shudder ran through his frame.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good God!" he stammeringly exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
 And he could think of nothing else to say, while Jean, in whose bones the
 very marrow seemed to be congealing, murmured in his resigned manner:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, worse luck! The gentleman, that relative of yours, was right all the
 same in saying that they are stronger than we."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was beside himself, could have strangled him. The Prussians
 stronger than the French! The thought made his blood boil. The peasant
 calmly and stubbornly added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "That don't matter, mind you. A man don't give up whipped at the first
 knock-down he gets. We shall have to keep hammering away at them all the
 same."
 </p>
 <p>
 But a tall figure arose before them. They recognized Rochas, still wrapped
 in his long mantle, whom the fugitive sounds about him, or it may have
 been the intuition of disaster, had awakened from his uneasy slumber. He
 questioned them, insisted on knowing all. When he was finally brought,
 with much difficulty, to see how matters stood, stupor, immense and
 profound, filled his boyish, inexpressive eyes. More than ten times in
 succession he repeated:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Beaten! How beaten? Why beaten?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that was the calamity that had lain hidden in the blackness of that
 night of agony. And now the pale dawn was appearing at the portals of the
 east, heralding a day heavy with bitterest sorrow and striking white upon
 the silent tents, in one of which began to be visible the ashy faces of
 Loubet and Lapoulle, of Chouteau and of Pache, who were snoring still with
 wide-open mouths. Forth from the thin mists that were slowly creeping
 upward from the river off yonder in the distance came the new day,
 bringing with it mourning and affliction.

 <h2>
 II.
 </h2>
 <p>
 About eight o'clock the sun dispersed the heavy clouds, and the broad,
 fertile plain about Mulhausen lay basking in the warm, bright light of a
 perfect August Sunday. From the camp, now awake and bustling with life,
 could be heard the bells of the neighboring parishes, pealing merrily in
 the limpid air. The cheerful Sunday following so close on ruin and defeat
 had its own gayety, its sky was as serene as on a holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gaude suddenly took his bugle and gave the call that announced the
 distribution of rations, whereat Loubet appeared astonished. What was it?
 What did it mean? Were they going to give out chickens, as he had promised
 Lapoulle the night before? He had been born in the Halles, in the Rue de
 la Cossonerie, was the unacknowledged son of a small huckster, had
 enlisted "for the money there was in it," as he said, after having been a
 sort of Jack-of-all-trades, and was now the gourmand, the epicure of the
 company, continually nosing after something good to eat. But he went off
 to see what was going on, while Chouteau, the company artist,
 house-painter by trade at Belleville, something of a dandy and a
 revolutionary republican, exasperated against the government for having
 called him back to the colors after he had served his time, was cruelly
 chaffing Pache, whom he had discovered on his knees, behind the tent,
 preparing to say his prayers. There was a pious man for you! Couldn't he
 oblige him, Chouteau, by interceding with God to give him a hundred
 thousand francs or some such small trifle? But Pache, an insignificant
 little fellow with a head running up to a point, who had come to them from
 some hamlet in the wilds of Picardy, received the other's raillery with
 the uncomplaining gentleness of a martyr. He was the butt of the squad, he
 and Lapoulle, the colossal brute who had got his growth in the marshes of
 the Sologne, so utterly ignorant of everything that on the day of his
 joining the regiment he had asked his comrades to show him the King. And
 although the terrible tidings of the disaster at Froeschwiller had been
 known throughout the camp since early morning, the four men laughed,
 joked, and went about their usual tasks with the indifference of so many
 machines.
 </p>
 <p>
 But there arose a murmur of pleased surprise. It was occasioned by Jean,
 the corporal, coming back from the commissary's, accompanied by Maurice,
 with a load of firewood. So, they were giving out wood at last, the lack
 of which the night before had deprived the men of their soup! Twelve hours
 behind time, only!
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hurrah for the commissary!" shouted Chouteau.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never mind, so long as it is here," said Loubet. "Ah! won't I make you a
 bully <i>pot-au-feu</i>!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He was usually quite willing to take charge of the mess arrangements, and
 no one was inclined to say him nay, for he cooked like an angel. On those
 occasions, however, Lapoulle would be given the most extraordinary
 commissions to execute.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go and look after the champagne&mdash;Go out and buy some truffles&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 On that morning a queer conceit flashed across his mind, such a conceit as
 only a Parisian <i>gamin</i> contemplating the mystification of a
 greenhorn is capable of entertaining:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look alive there, will you! Come, hand me the chicken."
 </p>
 <p>
 "The chicken! what chicken, where?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, there on the ground at your feet, stupid; the chicken that I
 promised you last night, and that the corporal has just brought in."
 </p>
 <p>
 He pointed to a large, white, round stone, and Lapoulle, speechless with
 wonder, finally picked it up and turned it about between his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A thousand thunders! Will you wash the chicken! More yet; wash its claws,
 wash its neck! Don't be afraid of the water, lazybones!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And for no reason at all except the joke of it, because the prospect of
 the soup made him gay and sportive, he tossed the stone along with the
 meat into the kettle filled with water.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's what will give the bouillon a flavor! Ah, you didn't know that, <i>sacree
 andouille</i>! You shall have the pope's nose; you'll see how tender it
 is."
 </p>
 <p>
 The squad roared with laughter at sight of Lapoulle's face, who swallowed
 everything and was licking his chops in anticipation of the feast. That
 funny dog, Loubet, he was the man to cure one of the dumps if anybody
 could! And when the fire began to crackle in the sunlight, and the kettle
 commenced to hum and bubble, they ranged themselves reverently about it in
 a circle with an expression of cheerful satisfaction on their faces,
 watching the meat as it danced up and down and sniffing the appetizing
 odor that it exhaled. They were as hungry as a pack of wolves, and the
 prospect of a square meal made them forgetful of all beside. They had had
 to take a thrashing, but that was no reason why a man should not fill his
 stomach. Fires were blazing and pots were boiling from one end of the camp
 to the other, and amid the silvery peals of the bells that floated from
 Mulhausen steeples mirth and jollity reigned supreme.
 </p>
 <p>
 But just as the clocks were on the point of striking nine a commotion
 arose and spread among the men; officers came running up, and Lieutenant
 Rochas, to whom Captain Beaudoin had come and communicated an order,
 passed along in front of the tents of his platoon and gave the command:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Pack everything! Get yourselves ready to march!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "But the soup?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You will have to wait for your soup until some other day; we are to march
 at once."
 </p>
 <p>
 Gaude's bugle rang out in imperious accents. Then everywhere was
 consternation; dumb, deep rage was depicted on every countenance. What,
 march on an empty stomach! Could they not wait a little hour until the
 soup was ready! The squad resolved that their bouillon should not go to
 waste, but it was only so much hot water, and the uncooked meat was like
 leather to their teeth. Chouteau growled and grumbled, almost mutinously.
 Jean had to exert all his authority to make the men hasten their
 preparations. What was the great urgency that made it necessary for them
 to hurry off like that? What good was there in hazing people about in that
 style, without giving them time to regain their strength? And Maurice
 shrugged his shoulders incredulously when someone said in his hearing that
 they were about to march against the Prussians and settle old scores with
 them. In less than fifteen minutes the tents were struck, folded, and
 strapped upon the knapsacks, the stacks were broken, and all that remained
 of the camp was the dying embers of the fires on the bare ground.
 </p>
 <p>
 There were reasons, of importance that had induced General Douay's
 determination to retreat immediately. The despatch from the <i>sous-prefet</i>
 at Schelestadt, now three days old, was confirmed; there were telegrams
 that the fires of the Prussians, threatening Markolsheim, had again been
 seen, and again, another telegram informed them that one of the enemy's
 army corps was crossing the Rhine at Huningue: the intelligence was
 definite and abundant; cavalry and artillery had been sighted in force,
 infantry had been seen, hastening from every direction to their point of
 concentration. Should they wait an hour the enemy would surely be in their
 rear and retreat on Belfort would be impossible. And now, in the shock
 consequent on defeat, after Wissembourg and Froeschwiller, the general,
 feeling himself unsupported in his exposed position at the front, had
 nothing left to do but fall back in haste, and the more so that what news
 he had received that morning made the situation look even worse than it
 had appeared the night before.
 </p>
 <p>
 The staff had gone on ahead at a sharp trot, spurring their horses in the
 fear lest the Prussians might get into Altkirch before them. General
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles, aware that he had a hard day's work before him, had
 prudently taken Mulhausen in his way, where he fortified himself with a
 copious breakfast, denouncing in language more forcible than elegant such
 hurried movements. And Mulhausen watched with sorrowful eyes the officers
 trooping through her streets; as the news of the retreat spread the
 citizens streamed out of their houses, deploring the sudden departure of
 the army for whose coming they had prayed so earnestly: they were to be
 abandoned, then, and all the costly merchandise that was stacked up in the
 railway station was to become the spoil of the enemy; within a few hours
 their pretty city was to be in the hands of foreigners? The inhabitants of
 the villages, too, and of isolated houses, as the staff clattered along
 the country roads, planted themselves before their doors with wonder and
 consternation depicted on their faces. What! that army, that a short while
 before they had seen marching forth to battle, was now retiring without
 having fired a shot? The leaders were gloomy, urged their chargers forward
 and refused to answer questions, as if ruin and disaster were galloping at
 their heels. It was true, then, that the Prussians had annihilated the
 army and were streaming into France from every direction, like the angry
 waves of a stream that had burst its barriers? And already to the
 frightened peasants the air seemed filled with the muttering of distant
 invasion, rising louder and more threatening at every instant, and already
 they were beginning to forsake their little homes and huddle their poor
 belongings into farm-carts; entire families might be seen fleeing in
 single file along the roads that were choked with the retreating cavalry.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the hurry and confusion of the movement the 106th was brought to a halt
 at the very first kilometer of their march, near the bridge over the canal
 of the Rhone and Rhine. The order of march had been badly planned and
 still more badly executed, so that the entire 2d division was collected
 there in a huddle, and the way was so narrow, barely more than sixteen
 feet in width, that the passage of the troops was obstructed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two hours elapsed, and still the 106th stood there watching the seemingly
 endless column that streamed along before their eyes. In the end the men,
 standing at rest with ordered arms, began to become impatient. Jean's
 squad, whose position happened to be opposite a break in the line of
 poplars where the sun had a fair chance at them, felt themselves
 particularly aggrieved.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Guess we must be the rear-guard," Loubet observed with good-natured
 raillery.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Chouteau scolded: "They don't value us at a brass farthing, and that's
 why they let us wait this way. We were here first; why didn't we take the
 road while it was empty?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And as they began to discern more clearly beyond the canal, across the
 wide fertile plain, along the level roads lined with hop-poles and fields
 of ripening grain, the movement of the troops retiring along the same way
 by which they had advanced but yesterday, gibes and jeers rose on the air
 in a storm of angry ridicule.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, we are taking the back track," Chouteau continued. "I wonder if that
 is the advance against the enemy that they have been dinning in our ears
 of late! Strikes me as rather queer! No sooner do we get into camp than we
 turn tail and make off, never even stopping to taste our soup."
 </p>
 <p>
 The derisive laughter became louder, and Maurice, who was next to Chouteau
 in the ranks, took sides with him. Why could they not have been allowed to
 cook their soup and eat it in peace, since they had done nothing for the
 last two hours but stand there in the road like so many sticks? Their
 hunger was making itself felt again; they had a resentful recollection of
 the savory contents of the kettle dumped out prematurely upon the ground,
 and they could see no necessity for this headlong retrograde movement,
 which appeared to them idiotic and cowardly. What chicken-livers they must
 be, those generals!
 </p>
 <p>
 But Lieutenant Rochas came along and blew up Sergeant Sapin for not
 keeping his men in better order, and Captain Beaudoin, very prim and
 starchy, attracted by the disturbance, appeared upon the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silence in the ranks!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, an old soldier of the army of Italy who knew what discipline was,
 looked in silent amazement at Maurice, who appeared to be amused by
 Chouteau's angry sneers; and he wondered how it was that a <i>monsieur</i>,
 a young man of his acquirements, could listen approvingly to things&mdash;they
 might be true, all the same&mdash;but that should not be blurted out in
 public. The army would never accomplish much, that was certain, if the
 privates were to take to criticizing the generals and giving their
 opinions.
 </p>
 <p>
 At last, after another hour's waiting, the order was given for the 106th
 to advance, but the bridge was still so encumbered by the rear of the
 division that the greatest confusion prevailed. Several regiments became
 inextricably mingled, and whole companies were swept away and compelled to
 cross whether they would or no, while others, crowded off to the side of
 the road, had to stand there and mark time; and by way of putting the
 finishing touch to the muddle; a squadron of cavalry insisted on passing,
 pressing back into the adjoining fields the stragglers that the infantry
 had scattered along the roadside. At the end of an hour's march the column
 had entirely lost its formation and was dragging its slow length along, a
 mere disorderly rabble.
 </p>
 <p>
 Thus it happened that Jean found himself away at the rear, lost in a
 sunken road, together with his squad, whom he had been unwilling to
 abandon. The 106th had disappeared, nor was there a man or an officer of
 their company in sight. About them were soldiers, singly or in little
 groups, from all the regiments, a weary, foot-sore crew, knocked up at the
 beginning of the retreat, each man straggling on at his own sweet will
 whithersoever the path that he was on might chance to lead him. The sun
 beat down fiercely, the heat was stifling, and the knapsack, loaded as it
 was with the tent and implements of every description, made a terrible
 burden on the shoulders of the exhausted men. To many of them the
 experience was an entirely new one, and the heavy great-coats they wore
 seemed to them like vestments of lead. The first to set an example for the
 others was a little pale faced soldier with watery eyes; he drew beside
 the road and let his knapsack slide off into the ditch, heaving a deep
 sigh as he did so, the long drawn breath of a dying man who feels himself
 coming back to life.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There's a man who knows what he is about," muttered Chouteau.
 </p>
 <p>
 He still continued to plod along, however, his back bending beneath its
 weary burden, but when he saw two others relieve themselves as the first
 had done he could stand it no longer. "Ah! <i>zut</i>!" he exclaimed, and
 with a quick upward jerk of the shoulder sent his kit rolling down an
 embankment. Fifty pounds at the end of his backbone, he had had enough of
 it, thank you! He was no beast of burden to lug that load about.
 </p>
 <p>
 Almost at the same moment Loubet followed his lead and incited Lapoulle to
 do the same. Pache, who had made the sign of the cross at every stone
 crucifix they came to, unbuckled the straps and carefully deposited his
 load at the foot of a low wall, as if fully intending to come back for it
 at some future time. And when Jean turned his head for a look at his men
 he saw that every one of them had dropped his burden except Maurice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Take up your knapsacks unless you want to have me put under arrest!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the men, although they did not mutiny as yet, were silent and looked
 ugly; they kept advancing along the narrow road, pushing the corporal
 before them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Will you take up your knapsacks! if you don't I will report you."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was as if Maurice had been lashed with a whip across the face. Report
 them! that brute of a peasant would report those poor devils for easing
 their aching shoulders! And looking Jean defiantly in the face, he, too,
 in an impulse of blind rage, slipped the buckles and let his knapsack fall
 to the road.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well," said the other in his quiet way, knowing that resistance
 would be of no avail, "we will settle accounts to-night."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's feet hurt him abominably; the big, stiff shoes, to which he was
 not accustomed, had chafed the flesh until the blood came. He was not
 strong; his spinal column felt as if it were one long raw sore, although
 the knapsack that had caused the suffering was no longer there, and the
 weight of his piece, which he kept shifting from one shoulder to the
 other, seemed as if it would drive all the breath from his body. Great as
 his physical distress was, however, his moral agony was greater still, for
 he was in the depths of one of those fits of despair to which he was
 subject. At Paris the sum of his wrongdoing had been merely the foolish
 outbreaks of "the other man," as he put it, of his weak, boyish nature,
 capable of more serious delinquency should he be subjected to temptation,
 but now, in this retreat that was so like a rout, in which he was dragging
 himself along with weary steps beneath a blazing sun, he felt all hope and
 courage vanishing from his heart, he was but a beast in that belated,
 straggling herd that filled the roads and fields. It was the reaction
 after the terrible disasters at Wissembourg and Froeschwiller, the echo of
 the thunder-clap that had burst in the remote distance, leagues and
 leagues away, rattling at the heels of those panic-stricken men who were
 flying before they had ever seen an enemy. What was there to hope for now?
 Was it not all ended? They were beaten; all that was left them was to lie
 down and die.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It makes no difference," shouted Loubet, with the <i>blague</i> of a
 child of the Halles, "but this is not the Berlin road we are traveling,
 all the same."
 </p>
 <p>
 To Berlin! To Berlin! The cry rang in Maurice's ears, the yell of the
 swarming mob that filled the boulevards on that midsummer night of
 frenzied madness when he had determined to enlist. The gentle breeze had
 become a devastating hurricane; there had been a terrific explosion, and
 all the sanguine temper of his nation had manifested itself in his
 absolute, enthusiastic confidence, which had vanished utterly at the very
 first reverse, before the unreasoning impulse of despair that was sweeping
 him away among those vagrant soldiers, vanquished and dispersed before
 they had struck a stroke.
 </p>
 <p>
 "This confounded blunderbuss must weigh a ton, I think," Loubet went on.
 "This is fine music to march by!" And alluding to the sum he received as
 substitute: "I don't care what people say, but fifteen hundred 'balls' for
 a job like this is downright robbery. Just think of the pipes he'll smoke,
 sitting by his warm fire, the stingy old miser in whose place I'm going to
 get my brains knocked out!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "As for me," growled Chouteau, "I had finished my time. I was going to cut
 the service, and they keep me for their beastly war. Ah! true as I stand
 here, I must have been born to bad luck to have got myself into such a
 mess. And now the officers are going to let the Prussians knock us about
 as they please, and we're dished and done for." He had been swinging his
 piece to and fro in his hand; in his discouragement he gave it a toss and
 landed it on the other side of the hedge. "Eh! get you gone for a dirty
 bit of old iron!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The musket made two revolutions in the air and fell into a furrow, where
 it lay, long and motionless, reminding one somehow of a corpse. Others
 soon flew to join it, and presently the field was filled with abandoned
 arms, lying in long winrows, a sorrowful spectacle beneath the blazing
 sky. It was an epidemic of madness, caused by the hunger that was gnawing
 at their stomach, the shoes that galled their feet, their weary march, the
 unexpected defeat that had brought the enemy galloping at their heels.
 There was nothing more to be accomplished; their leaders were looking out
 for themselves, the commissariat did not even feed them; nothing but
 weariness and worriment; better to leave the whole business at once,
 before it was begun. And what then? why, the musket might go and keep the
 knapsack company; in view of the work that was before them they might at
 least as well keep their arms free. And all down the long line of
 stragglers that stretched almost far as the eye could reach in the smooth
 and fertile country the muskets flew through the air to the accompaniment
 of jeers and laughter such as would have befitted the inmates of a lunatic
 asylum out for a holiday.
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet, before parting with his, gave it a twirl as a drum-major does his
 cane. Lapoulle, observing what all his comrades were doing, must have
 supposed the performance to be some recent innovation in the manual, and
 followed suit, while Pache, in the confused idea of duty that he owed to
 his religious education, refused to do as the rest were doing and was
 loaded with obloquy by Chouteau, who called him a priest's whelp.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look at the sniveling papist! And all because his old peasant of a mother
 used to make him swallow the holy wafer every Sunday in the village church
 down there! Be off with you and go serve mass; a man who won't stick with
 his comrades when they are right is a poor-spirited cur."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice toiled along dejectedly in silence, bowing his head beneath the
 blazing sun. At every step he took he seemed to be advancing deeper into a
 horrid, phantom-haunted nightmare; it was as if he saw a yawning, gaping
 gulf before him toward which he was inevitably tending; it meant that he
 was suffering himself to be degraded to the level of the miserable beings
 by whom he was surrounded, that he was prostituting his talents and his
 position as a man of education.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hold!" he said abruptly to Chouteau, "what you say is right; there is
 truth in it."
 </p>
 <p>
 And already he had deposited his musket upon a pile of stones, when Jean,
 who had tried without success to check the shameful proceedings of his
 men, saw what he was doing and hurried toward him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Take up your musket, at once! Do you hear me? take it up at once!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's face had flushed with sudden anger. Meekest and most pacific of
 men, always prone to measures of conciliation, his eyes were now blazing
 with wrath, his voice spoke with the thunders of authority. His men had
 never before seen him in such a state, and they looked at one another in
 astonishment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Take up your musket at once, or you will have me to deal with!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was quivering with anger; he let fall one single word, into which
 he infused all the insult that he had at command:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Peasant!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, that's just it; I am a peasant, while you, you, are a gentleman! And
 it is for that reason that you are a pig! Yes! a dirty pig! I make no
 bones of telling you of it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Yells and cat-calls arose all around him, but the corporal continued with
 extraordinary force and dignity:
 </p>
 <p>
 "When a man has learning he shows it by his actions. If we are brutes and
 peasants, you owe us the benefit of your example, since you know more than
 we do. Take up your musket, or <i>Nom de Dieu!</i> I will have you shot
 the first halt we make."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was daunted; he stooped and raised the weapon in his hand. Tears
 of rage stood in his eyes. He reeled like a drunken man as he labored
 onward, surrounded by his comrades, who now were jeering at him for having
 yielded. Ah, that Jean! he felt that he should never cease to hate him,
 cut to the quick as he had been by that bitter lesson, which he could not
 but acknowledge he had deserved. And when Chouteau, marching at his side,
 growled: "When corporals are that way, we just wait for a battle and blow
 a hole in 'em," the landscape seemed red before his eyes, and he had a
 distinct vision of himself blowing Jean's brains out from behind a wall.
 </p>
 <p>
 But an incident occurred to divert their thoughts; Loubet noticed that
 while the dispute was going on Pache had also abandoned his musket, laying
 it down tenderly at the foot of an embankment. Why? What were the reasons
 that had made him resist the example of his comrades in the first place,
 and what were the reasons that influenced him now? He probably could not
 have told himself, nor did he trouble his head about the matter, chuckling
 inwardly with silent enjoyment, like a schoolboy who, having long been
 held up as a model for his mates, commits his first offense. He strode
 along with a self-contented, rakish air, swinging his arms; and still
 along the dusty, sunlit roads, between the golden grain and the fields of
 hops that succeeded one another with tiresome monotony, the human tide
 kept pouring onward; the stragglers, without arms or knapsacks, were now
 but a shuffling, vagrant mob, a disorderly array of vagabonds and beggars,
 at whose approach the frightened villagers barred their doors.
 </p>
 <p>
 Something that happened just then capped the climax of Maurice's misery. A
 deep, rumbling noise had for some time been audible in the distance; it
 was the artillery, that had been the last to leave the camp and whose
 leading guns now wheeled into sight around a bend in the road, barely
 giving the footsore infantrymen time to seek safety in the fields. It was
 an entire regiment of six batteries, and came up in column, in splendid
 order, at a sharp trot, the colonel riding on the flank at the center of
 the line, every officer at his post. The guns went rattling, bounding by,
 accurately maintaining their prescribed distances, each accompanied by its
 caisson, men and horses, beautiful in the perfect symmetry of its
 arrangement; and in the 5th battery Maurice recognized his cousin Honore.
 A very smart and soldierly appearance the quartermaster-sergeant presented
 on horseback in his position on the left hand of the forward driver, a
 good-looking light-haired man, Adolphe by name, whose mount was a sturdy
 chestnut, admirably matched with the mate that trotted at his side, while
 in his proper place among the six men who were seated on the chests of the
 gun and its caisson was the gunner, Louis, a small, dark man, Adolphe's
 comrade; they constituted a team, as it is called, in accordance with the
 rule of the service that couples a mounted and an unmounted man together.
 They all appeared bigger and taller to Maurice, somehow, than when he
 first made their acquaintance at the camp, and the gun, to which four
 horses were attached, followed by the caisson drawn by six, seemed to him
 as bright and refulgent as a sun, tended and cherished as it was by its
 attendants, men and animals, who closed around it protectingly as if it
 had been a living sentient relative; and then, besides, the contemptuous
 look that Honore, astounded to behold him among that unarmed rabble, cast
 on the stragglers, distressed him terribly. And now the tail end of the
 regiment was passing, the <i>materiel</i> of the batteries, prolonges,
 forges, forage-wagons, succeeded by the rag-tag, the spare men and horses,
 and then all vanished in a cloud of dust at another turn in the road amid
 the gradually decreasing clatter of hoofs and wheels.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Pardi</i>!" exclaimed Loubet, "it's not such a difficult matter to cut
 a dash when one travels with a coach and four!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The staff had found Altkirch free from the enemy; not a Prussian had shown
 his face there yet. It had been the general's wish, not knowing at what
 moment they might fall upon his rear, that the retreat should be continued
 to Dannemarie, and it was not until five o'clock that the heads of columns
 reached that place. Tents were hardly pitched and fires lighted at eight,
 when night closed in, so great was the confusion of the regiments,
 depleted by the absence of the stragglers. The men were completely used
 up, were ready to drop with fatigue and hunger. Up to eight o'clock
 soldiers, singly and in squads, came trailing in, hunting for their
 commands; all that long train of the halt, the lame, and the disaffected
 that we have seen scattered along the roads.
 </p>
 <p>
 As soon as Jean discovered where his regiment lay he went in quest of
 Lieutenant Rochas to make his report. He found him, together with Captain
 Beaudoin, in earnest consultation with the colonel at the door of a small
 inn, all of them anxiously waiting to see what tidings roll-call would
 give them as to the whereabouts of their missing men. The moment the
 corporal opened his mouth to address the lieutenant, Colonel Vineuil, who
 heard what the subject was, called him up and compelled him to tell the
 whole story. On his long, yellow face, where the intensely black eyes
 looked blacker still contrasted with the thick snow-white hair and the
 long, drooping mustache, there was an expression of patient, silent
 sorrow, and as the narrative proceeded, how the miserable wretches
 deserted their colors, threw away arms and knapsacks, and wandered off
 like vagabonds, grief and shame traced two new furrows on his blanched
 cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Colonel," exclaimed Captain Beaudoin, in his incisive voice, not waiting
 for his superior to give an opinion, "it will best to shoot half a dozen
 of those wretches."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the lieutenant nodded his head approvingly. But the colonel's
 despondent look expressed his powerlessness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There are too many of them. Nearly seven hundred! how are we to go to
 work, whom are we to select? And then you don't know it, but the general
 is opposed. He wants to be a father to his men, says he never punished a
 soldier all the time he was in Africa. No, no; we shall have to overlook
 it. I can do nothing. It is dreadful."
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain echoed: "Yes, it is dreadful. It means destruction for us
 all."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was walking off, having said all he had to say, when he heard Major
 Bouroche, whom he had not seen where he was standing in the doorway of the
 inn, growl in a smothered voice: "No more punishment, an end to
 discipline, the army gone to the dogs! Before a week is over the
 scoundrels will be ripe for kicking their officers out of camp, while if a
 few of them had been made an example of on the spot it might have brought
 the remainder to their senses."
 </p>
 <p>
 No one was punished. Some officers of the rear-guard that was protecting
 the trains had been thoughtful enough to collect the muskets and knapsacks
 scattered along the road. They were almost all recovered, and by daybreak
 the men were equipped again, the operation being conducted very quietly,
 as if to hush the matter up as much as possible. Orders were given to
 break camp at five o'clock, but reveille sounded at four and the retreat
 to Belfort was hurriedly continued, for everyone was certain that the
 Prussians were only two or three leagues away. Again there was nothing to
 eat but dry biscuit, and as a consequence of their brief, disturbed rest
 and the lack of something to warm their stomachs the men were weak as
 cats. Any attempt to enforce discipline on the march that morning was
 again rendered nugatory by the manner of their departure.
 </p>
 <p>
 The day was worse than its predecessor, inexpressibly gloomy and
 disheartening. The aspect of the landscape had changed, they were now in a
 rolling country where the roads they were always alternately climbing and
 descending were bordered with woods of pine and hemlock, while the narrow
 gorges were golden with tangled thickets of broom. But panic and terror
 lay heavy on the fair land that slumbered there beneath the bright sun of
 August, and had been hourly gathering strength since the preceeding day. A
 fresh dispatch, bidding the mayors of communes warn the people that they
 would do well to hide their valuables, had excited universal
 consternation. The enemy was at hand, then! Would time be given them to
 make their escape? And to all it seemed that the roar of invasion was
 ringing in their ears, coming nearer and nearer, the roar of the rushing
 torrent that, starting from Mulhausen, had grown louder and more ominous
 as it advanced, and to which every village that it encountered in its
 course contributed its own alarm amid the sound of wailing and
 lamentation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice stumbled along as best he might, like a man walking in a dream;
 his feet were bleeding, his shoulders sore with the weight of gun and
 knapsack. He had ceased to think, he advanced automatically into the
 vision of horrors that lay before his eyes; he had ceased to be conscious
 even of the shuffling tramp of the comrades around him, and the only thing
 that was not dim and unreal to his sense was Jean, marching at his side
 and enduring the same fatigue and horrible distress. It was lamentable to
 behold the villages they passed through, a sight to make a man's heart
 bleed with anguish. No sooner did the inhabitants catch sight of the
 troops retreating in disorderly array, with haggard faces and bloodshot
 eyes, than they bestirred themselves to hasten their flight. They who had
 been so confident only a short half month ago, those men and women of
 Alsace, who smiled when war was mentioned, certain that it would be fought
 out in Germany! And now France was invaded, and it was among them, above
 their abodes, in their fields, that the tempest was to burst, like one of
 those dread cataclysms that lay waste a province in an hour when the
 lightnings flash and the gates of heaven are opened! Carts were backed up
 against doors and men tumbled their furniture into them in wild confusion,
 careless of what they broke. From the upper windows the women threw out a
 last mattress, or handed down the child's cradle, that they had been near
 forgetting, whereon baby would be tucked in securely and hoisted to the
 top of the load, where he reposed serenely among a grove of legs of chairs
 and upturned tables. At the back of another cart was the decrepit old
 grandfather tied with cords to a wardrobe, and he was hauled away for all
 the world as if he had been one of the family chattels. Then there were
 those who did not own a vehicle, so they piled their household goods
 haphazard on a wheelbarrow, while others carried an armful of clothing,
 and others still had thought only of saving the clock, which they went off
 pressing to their bosom as if it had been a darling child. They found they
 could not remove everything, and there were chairs and tables, and bundles
 of linen too heavy to carry, lying abandoned in the gutter, Some before
 leaving had carefully locked their dwellings, and the houses had a
 deathlike appearance, with their barred doors and windows, but the greater
 number, in their haste to get away and with the sorrowful conviction that
 nothing would escape destruction, had left their poor abodes open, and the
 yawning apertures displayed the nakedness of the dismantled rooms; and
 those were the saddest to behold, with the horrible sadness of a city upon
 which some great dread has fallen, depopulating it, those poor houses
 opened to the winds of heaven, whence the very cats had fled as if
 forewarned of the impending doom. At every village the pitiful spectacle
 became more heartrending, the number of the fugitives was greater, as they
 clove their way through the ever thickening press, with hands upraised,
 amid oaths and tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 But in the open country as they drew near Belfort, Maurice's heart was
 still more sorely wrung, for there the homeless fugitives were in greater
 numbers and lined the borders of the road in an unbroken cortege. Ah! the
 unhappy ones, who had believed that they were to find safety under the
 walls of the fortifications! The father lashed the poor old nag, the
 mother followed after, leading her crying children by the hand, and in
 this way entire families, sinking beneath the weight of their burdens,
 were strung along the white, blinding road in the fierce sunlight, where
 the tired little legs of the smaller children were unable to keep up with
 the headlong flight. Many had taken off their shoes and were going
 barefoot so as to get over the ground more rapidly, and half-dressed
 mothers gave the breast to their crying babies as they strode along.
 Affrighted faces turned for a look backward, trembling hands were raised
 as if to shut out the horizon from their sight, while the gale of panic
 tumbled their unkempt locks and sported with their ill-adjusted garments.
 Others there were, farmers and their men, who pushed straight across the
 fields, driving before them their flocks and herds, cows, oxen, sheep,
 horses, that they had driven with sticks and cudgels from their stables;
 these were seeking the shelter of the inaccessible forests, of the deep
 valleys and the lofty hill-tops, their course marked by clouds of dust, as
 in the great migrations of other days, when invaded nations made way
 before their barbarian conquerors. They were going to live in tents, in
 some lonely nook among the mountains, where the enemy would never venture
 to follow them; and the bleating and bellowing of the animals and the
 trampling of their hoofs upon the rocks grew fainter in the distance, and
 the golden nimbus that overhung them was lost to sight among the thick
 pines, while down in the road beneath the tide of vehicles and pedestrians
 was flowing still as strong as ever, blocking the passage of the troops,
 and as they drew near Belfort the men had to be brought to a halt again
 and again, so irresistible was the force of that torrent of humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was during one of those short halts that Maurice witnessed a scene that
 was destined to remain indelibly impressed upon his memory.
 </p>
 <p>
 Standing by the road-side was a lonely house, the abode of some poor
 peasant, whose lean acres extended up the mountainside in the rear. The
 man had been unwilling to leave the little field that was his all and had
 remained, for to go away would have been to him like parting with life. He
 could be seen within the low-ceiled room, sitting stupidly on a bench,
 watching with dull, lack-luster eyes the passing of the troops whose
 retreat would give his ripe grain over to be the spoil of the enemy.
 Standing beside him was his wife, still a young woman, holding in her arms
 a child, while another was hanging by her skirts; all three were weeping
 bitterly. Suddenly the door was thrown open with violence and in its
 enframement appeared the grandmother, a very old woman, tall and lean of
 form, with bare, sinewy arms like knotted cords that she raised above her
 head and shook with frantic gestures. Her gray, scanty locks had escaped
 from her cap and were floating about her skinny face, and such was her
 fury that the words she shouted choked her utterance and came from her
 lips almost unintelligible.
 </p>
 <p>
 At first the soldiers had laughed. Wasn't she a beauty, the old crazy hag!
 Then words reached their ears; the old woman was screaming:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Scum! Robbers! Cowards! Cowards!"
 </p>
 <p>
 With a voice that rose shriller and more piercing still she kept lashing
 them with her tongue, expectorating insult on them, and taunting them for
 dastards with the full force of her lungs. And the laughter ceased, it
 seemed as if a cold wind had blown over the ranks. The men hung their
 heads, looked any way save that.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Cowards! Cowards! Cowards!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then all at once her stature seemed to dilate; she drew herself up, tragic
 in her leanness, in her poor old apology for a gown, and sweeping the
 heavens with her long arm from west to east, with a gesture so broad that
 it seemed to fill the dome:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Cowards, the Rhine is not there! The Rhine lies yonder! Cowards,
 cowards!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They got under way again at last, and Maurice, whose look just then
 encountered Jean's, saw that the latter's eyes were filled with tears, and
 it did not alleviate his distress to think that those rough soldiers,
 compelled to swallow an insult that they had done nothing to deserve, were
 shamed by it. He was conscious of nothing save the intolerable aching in
 his poor head, and in after days could never remember how the march of
 that day ended, prostrated as he was by his terrible suffering, mental and
 physical.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 7th corps had spent the entire day in getting over the fourteen or
 fifteen miles between Dannemarie and Belfort, and it was night again
 before the troops got settled in their bivouacs under the walls of the
 town, in the very same place whence they had started four days before to
 march against the enemy. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and
 their spent condition, the men insisted on lighting fires and making soup;
 it was the first time since their departure that they had had an
 opportunity to put warm food into their stomachs, and seated about the
 cheerful blaze in the cool air of evening they were dipping their noses in
 the porringers and grunting inarticulately in token of satisfaction when
 news came in that burst upon the camp like a thunderbolt, dumfoundering
 everyone. Two telegrams had just been received: the Prussians had not
 crossed the Rhine at Markolsheim, and there was not a single Prussian at
 Huningue. The passage of the Rhine at Markolsheim and the bridge of boats
 constructed under the electric light had existed merely in imagination,
 were an unexplained, inexplicable nightmare of the prefet at Schelestadt;
 and as for the army corps that had menaced Huningue, that famous corps of
 the Black Forest, that had made so much talk, it was but an insignificant
 detachment of Wurtemburgers, a couple of battalions of infantry and a
 squadron of cavalry, which had maneuvered with such address, marching and
 countermarching, appearing in one place and then suddenly popping up in
 another at a distance, as to gain for themselves the reputation of being
 thirty or forty thousand strong. And to think that that morning they had
 been near blowing up the viaduct at Dannemarie! Twenty leagues of fertile
 country had been depopulated by the most idiotic of panics, and at the
 recollection of what they had seen during their lamentable day's march,
 the inhabitants flying in consternation to the mountains, driving their
 cattle before them; the press of vehicles, laden with household effects,
 streaming cityward and surrounded by bands of weeping women and children,
 the soldiers waxed wroth and gave way to bitter, sneering denunciation of
 their leaders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! it is too ridiculous too talk about!" sputtered Loubet, not stopping
 to empty his mouth, brandishing his spoon. "They take us out to fight the
 enemy, and there's not a soul to fight with! Twelve leagues there and
 twelve leagues back, and not so much as a mouse in front of us! All that
 for nothing, just for the fun of being scared to death!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Chouteau, who was noisily absorbing the last drops in his porringer,
 bellowed his opinion of the generals, without mentioning names:
 </p>
 <p>
 "The pigs! what miserable boobies they are, <i>hein</i>! A pretty pack of
 dunghill-cocks the government has given us as commanders! Wonder what they
 would do if they had an army actually before them, if they show the white
 feather this way when there's not a Prussian in sight, <i>hein</i>!&mdash;Ah
 no, not any of it in mine, thank you; soldiers don't obey such
 pigeon-livered gentlemen."
 </p>
 <p>
 Someone had thrown another armful of wood on the fire for the pleasurable
 sensation of comfort there was in the bright, dancing flame, and Lapoulle,
 who was engaged in the luxurious occupation of toasting his shins,
 suddenly went off into an imbecile fit of laughter without in the least
 understanding what it was about, whereon Jean, who had thus far turned a
 deaf ear to their talk, thought it time to interfere, which he did by
 saying in a fatherly way:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You had better hold your tongue, you fellows! It might be the worse for
 you if anyone should hear you."
 </p>
 <p>
 He himself, in his untutored, common-sense way of viewing things, was
 exasperated by the stupid incompetency of their commanders, but then
 discipline must be maintained, and as Chouteau still kept up a low
 muttering he cut him short:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Be silent, I say! Here is the lieutenant: address yourself to him if you
 have anything to say."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice had listened in silence to the conversation from his place a
 little to one side. Ah, truly, the end was near! Scarcely had they made a
 beginning, and all was over. That lack of discipline, that seditious
 spirit among the men at the very first reverse, had already made the army
 a demoralized, disintegrated rabble that would melt away at the first
 indication of catastrophe. There they were, under the walls of Belfort,
 without having sighted a Prussian, and they were whipped.
 </p>
 <p>
 The succeeding days were a period of monotony, full of uncertainty and
 anxious forebodings. To keep his troops occupied General Douay set them to
 work on the defenses of the place, which were in a state of
 incompleteness; there was great throwing up of earth and cutting through
 rock. And not the first item of news! Where was MacMahon's army? What was
 going on at Metz? The wildest rumors were current, and the Parisian
 journals, by their system of printing news only to contradict it the next
 day, kept the country in an agony of suspense. Twice, it was said, the
 general had written and asked for instructions, and had not even received
 an answer. On the 12th of August, however, the 7th corps was augmented by
 the 3d division, which landed from Italy, but there were still only two
 divisions for duty, for the 1st had participated in the defeat at
 Froeschwiller, had been swept away in the general rout, and as yet no one
 had learned where it had been stranded by the current. After a week of
 this abandonment, of this entire separation from the rest of France, a
 telegram came bringing them the order to march. The news was well
 received, for anything was preferable to the prison life they were leading
 in Belfort. And while they were getting themselves in readiness conjecture
 and surmise were the order of the day, for no one as yet knew what their
 destination was to be, some saying that they were to be sent to the
 defense of Strasbourg, while others spoke with confidence of a bold dash
 into the Black Forest that was to sever the Prussian line of
 communication.
 </p>
 <p>
 Early the next morning the 106th was bundled into cattle-cars and started
 off among the first. The car that contained Jean's squad was particularly
 crowded, so much so that Loubet declared there was not even room in it to
 sneeze. It was a load of humanity, sent off to the war just as a load of
 sacks would have been dispatched to the mill, crowded in so as to get the
 greatest number into the smallest space, and as rations had been given out
 in the usual hurried, slovenly manner and the men had received in brandy
 what they should have received in food, the consequence was that they were
 all roaring drunk, with a drunkenness that vented itself in obscene songs,
 varied by shrieks and yells. The heavy train rolled slowly onward; pipes
 were alight and men could no longer see one another through the dense
 clouds of smoke; the heat and odor that emanated from that mass of
 perspiring human flesh were unendurable, while from the jolting, dingy van
 came volleys of shouts and laughter that drowned the monotonous rattle of
 the wheels and were lost amid the silence of the deserted fields. And it
 was not until they reached Langres that the troops learned that they were
 being carried back to Paris.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>nom de Dieu!</i>" exclaimed Chouteau, who already, by virtue of
 his oratorical ability, was the acknowledged sovereign of his corner,
 "they will station us at Charentonneau, sure, to keep old Bismarck out of
 the Tuileries."
 </p>
 <p>
 The others laughed loud and long, considering the joke a very good one,
 though no one could say why. The most trivial incidents of the journey,
 however, served to elicit a storm of yells, cat-calls, and laughter: a
 group of peasants standing beside the roadway, or the anxious faces of the
 people who hung about the way-stations in the hope of picking up some bits
 of news from the passing trains, epitomizing on a small scale the
 breathless, shuddering alarm that pervaded all France in the presence of
 invasion. And so it happened that as the train thundered by, a fleeting
 vision of pandemonium, all that the good burghers obtained in the way of
 intelligence was the salutations of that cargo of food for powder as it
 hurried onward to its destination, fast as steam could carry it. At a
 station where they stopped, however, three well-dressed ladies, wealthy
 bourgeoises of the town, who distributed cups of bouillon among the men,
 were received with great respect. Some of the soldiers shed tears, and
 kissed their hands as they thanked them.
 </p>
 <p>
 But as soon as they were under way again the filthy songs and the wild
 shouts began afresh, and so it went on until, a little while after leaving
 Chaumont, they met another train that was conveying some batteries of
 artillery to Metz. The locomotives slowed down and the soldiers in the two
 trains fraternized with a frightful uproar. The artillerymen were also
 apparently very drunk; they stood up in their seats, and thrusting hands
 and arms out of the car-windows, gave this cry with a vehemence that
 silenced every other sound:
 </p>
 <p>
 "To the slaughter! to the slaughter! to the slaughter!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was as if a cold wind, a blast from the charnel-house, had swept
 through the car. Amid the sudden silence that descended on them Loubet's
 irreverent voice was heard, shouting:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Not very cheerful companions, those fellows!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "But they are right," rejoined Chouteau, as if addressing some pot-house
 assemblage; "it is a beastly thing to send a lot of brave boys to have
 their brains blown out for a dirty little quarrel about which they don't
 know the first word."
 </p>
 <p>
 And much more in the same strain. He was the type of the Belleville
 agitator, a lazy, dissipated mechanic, perverting his fellow workmen,
 constantly spouting the ill-digested odds and ends of political harangues
 that he had heard, belching forth in the same breath the loftiest
 sentiments and the most asinine revolutionary clap-trap. He knew it all,
 and tried to inoculate his comrades with his ideas, especially Lapoulle,
 of whom he had promised to make a lad of spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't you see, old man, it's all perfectly simple. If Badinguet and
 Bismarck have a quarrel, let 'em go to work with their fists and fight it
 out and not involve in their row some hundreds of thousands of men who
 don't even know one another by sight and have not the slightest desire to
 fight."
 </p>
 <p>
 The whole car laughed and applauded, and Lapoulle, who did not know who
 Badinguet[*] was, and could not have told whether it was a king or an
 emperor in whose cause he was fighting, repeated like the gigantic baby
 that he was:
 </p>
 <p>
 [*] Napoleon III.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Of course, let 'em fight it out, and take a drink together afterward."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Chouteau had turned to Pache, whom he now proceeded to take in hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are in the same boat, you, who pretend to believe in the good God. He
 has forbidden men to fight, your good God has. Why, then, are you here,
 you great simpleton?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>!" Pache doubtfully replied, "it is not for any pleasure of
 mine that I am here&mdash;but the gendarmes&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, indeed, the gendarmes! let the gendarmes go milk the ducks!&mdash;say,
 do you know what we would do, all of us, if we had the least bit of
 spirit? I'll tell you; just the minute that they land us from the cars
 we'd skip; yes, we'd go straight home, and leave that pig of a Badinguet
 and his gang of two-for-a-penny generals to settle accounts with their
 beastly Prussians as best they may!"
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a storm of bravos; the leaven of perversion was doing its work
 and it was Chouteau's hour of triumph, airing his muddled theories and
 ringing the changes on the Republic, the Rights of Man, the rottenness of
 the Empire, which must be destroyed, and the treason of their commanders,
 who, as it had been proved, had sold themselves to the enemy at the rate
 of a million a piece. <i>He</i> was a revolutionist, he boldly declared;
 the others could not even say that they were republicans, did not know
 what their opinions were, in fact, except Loubet, the concocter of stews
 and hashes, and <i>he</i> had an opinion, for he had been for soup, first,
 last, and always; but they all, carried away by his eloquence, shouted
 none the less lustily against the Emperor, their officers, the whole d&mdash;&mdash;d
 shop, which they would leave the first chance they got, see if they
 wouldn't! And Chouteau, while fanning the flame of their discontent, kept
 an eye on Maurice, the fine gentleman, who appeared interested and whom he
 was proud to have for a companion; so that, by way of inflaming <i>his</i>
 passions also, it occurred to him to make an attack on Jean, who had thus
 far been tranquilly watching the proceedings out of his half-closed eyes,
 unmoved among the general uproar. If there was any remnant of resentment
 in the bosom of the volunteer since the time when the corporal had
 inflicted such a bitter humiliation on him by forcing him to resume his
 abandoned musket, now was a fine chance to set the two men by the ears.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I know some folks who talk of shooting us," Chouteau continued, with an
 ugly look at Jean; "dirty, miserable skunks, who treat us worse than
 beasts, and, when a man's back is broken with the weight of his knapsack
 and Brownbess, <i>aie</i>! <i>aie</i>! object to his planting them in the
 fields to see if a new crop will grow from them. What do you suppose they
 would say, comrades, <i>hein</i>! now that we are masters, if we should
 pitch them all out upon the track, and teach them better manners? That's
 the way to do, <i>hein</i>! We'll show 'em that we won't be bothered any
 longer with their mangy wars. Down with Badinguet's bed-bugs! Death to the
 curs who want to make us fight!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's face was aflame with the crimson tide that never failed to rush to
 his cheeks in his infrequent fits of anger. He rose, wedged in though as
 he was between his neighbors as firmly as in a vise, and his blazing eyes
 and doubled fists had such a look of business about them that the other
 quailed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> will you be silent, pig! For hours I have sat
 here without saying anything, because we have no longer any leaders, and I
 could not even send you to the guard-house. Yes, there's no doubt of it,
 it would be a good thing to shoot such men as you and rid the regiment of
 the vermin. But see here, as there's no longer any discipline, I will
 attend to your case myself. There's no corporal here now, but a
 hard-fisted fellow who is tired of listening to your jaw, and he'll see if
 he can't make you keep your potato-trap shut. Ah! you d&mdash;&mdash;d
 coward! You won't fight yourself and you want to keep others from
 fighting! Repeat your words once and I'll knock your head off!"
 </p>
 <p>
 By this time the whole car, won over by Jean's manly attitude, had
 deserted Chouteau, who cowered back in his seat as if not anxious to face
 his opponent's big fists.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And I care no more for Badinguet than I do for you, do you understand? I
 despise politics, whether they are republican or imperial, and now, as in
 the past, when I used to cultivate my little farm, there is but one thing
 that I wish for, and that is the happiness of all, peace and good-order,
 freedom for every man to attend to his affairs. No one denies that war is
 a terrible business, but that is no reason why a man should not be treated
 to the sight of a firing-party when he comes trying to dishearten people
 who already have enough to do to keep their courage up. Good Heavens,
 friends, how it makes a man's pulses leap to be told that the Prussians
 are in the land and that he is to go help drive them out!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, with the customary fickleness of a mob, the soldiers applauded the
 corporal, who again announced his determination to thrash the first man of
 his squad who should declare non-combatant principles. Bravo, the
 corporal! they would soon settle old Bismarck's hash! And, in the midst of
 the wild ovation of which he was the object, Jean, who had recovered his
 self-control, turned politely to Maurice and addressed him as if he had
 not been one of his men:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Monsieur, you cannot have anything in common with those poltroons. Come,
 we haven't had a chance at them yet; we are the boys who will give them a
 good basting yet, those Prussians!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It seemed to Maurice at that moment as if a ray of cheering sunshine had
 penetrated his heart. He was humiliated, vexed with himself. What! that
 man was nothing more than an uneducated rustic! And he remembered the
 fierce hatred that had burned in his bosom the day he was compelled to
 pick up the musket that he had thrown away in a moment of madness. But he
 also remembered his emotion at seeing the two big tears that stood in the
 corporal's eyes when the old grandmother, her gray hairs streaming in the
 wind, had so bitterly reproached them and pointed to the Rhine that lay
 beneath the horizon in the distance. Was it the brotherhood of fatigue and
 suffering endured in common that had served thus to dissipate his wrathful
 feelings? He was Bonapartist by birth, and had never thought of the
 Republic except in a speculative, dreamy way; his feeling toward the
 Emperor, personally, too, inclined to friendliness, and he was favorable
 to the war, the very condition of national existence, the great
 regenerative school of nationalities. Hope, all at once, with one of those
 fitful impulses of the imagination, that were common in his temperament,
 revived in him, while the enthusiastic ardor that had impelled him to
 enlist one night again surged through his veins and swelled his heart with
 confidence of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, of course, Corporal," he gayly replied, "we shall give them a
 basting!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And still the car kept rolling onward with its load of human freight,
 filled with reeking smoke of pipes and emanations of the crowded men,
 belching its ribald songs and drunken shouts among the expectant throngs
 of the stations through which it passed, among the rows of white-faced
 peasants who lined the iron-way. On the 20th of August they were at the
 Pantin Station in Paris, and that same evening boarded another train which
 landed them next day at Rheims <i>en route</i> for the camp at Chalons.

 <h2>
 III.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Maurice was greatly surprised when the 106th, leaving the cars at Rheims,
 received orders to go into camp there. So they were not to go to Chalons,
 then, and unite with the army there? And when, two hours later, his
 regiment had stacked muskets a league or so from the city over in the
 direction of Courcelles, in the broad plain that lies along the canal
 between the Aisne and Marne, his astonishment was greater still to learn
 that the entire army of Chalons had been falling back all that morning and
 was about to bivouac at that place. From one extremity of the horizon to
 the other, as far as Saint Thierry and Menvillette, even beyond the Laon
 road, the tents were going up, and when it should be night the fires of
 four army-corps would be blazing there. It was evident that the plan now
 was to go and take a position under the walls of Paris and there await the
 Prussians; and it was fortunate that that plan had received the
 approbation of the government, for was it not the wisest thing they could
 do?
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice devoted the afternoon of the 21st to strolling about the camp in
 search of news. The greatest freedom prevailed; discipline appeared to
 have been relaxed still further, the men went and came at their own sweet
 will. He found no obstacle in the way of his return to the city, where he
 desired to cash a money-order for a hundred francs that his sister
 Henriette had sent him. While in a cafe he heard a sergeant telling of the
 disaffection that existed in the eighteen battalions of the garde mobile
 of the Seine, which had just been sent back to Paris; the 6th battalion
 had been near killing their officers. Not a day passed at the camp that
 the generals were not insulted, and since Froeschwiller the soldiers had
 ceased to give Marshal MacMahon the military salute. The cafe resounded
 with the sound of voices in excited conversation; a violent dispute arose
 between two sedate burghers in respect to the number of men that MacMahon
 would have at his disposal. One of them made the wild assertion that there
 would be three hundred thousand; the other, who seemed to be more at home
 upon the subject, stated the strength of the four corps: the 12th, which
 had just been made complete at the camp with great difficulty with the
 assistance of provisional regiments and a division of infanterie de
 marine; the 1st, which had been coming straggling in in fragments ever
 since the 14th of the month and of which they were doing what they could
 to perfect the organization; the 5th, defeated before it had ever fought a
 battle, swept away and broken up in the general panic, and finally, the
 7th, then landing from the cars, demoralized like all the rest and minus
 its 1st division, of which it had just recovered the remains at Rheims; in
 all, one hundred and twenty thousand at the outside, including the
 cavalry, Bonnemain's and Margueritte's divisions. When the sergeant took a
 hand in the quarrel, however, speaking of the army in terms of the utmost
 contempt, characterizing it as a ruffianly rabble, with no <i>esprit de
 corps</i>, with nothing to keep it together,&mdash;a pack of greenhorns
 with idiots to conduct them, to the slaughter,&mdash;the two bourgeois
 began to be uneasy, and fearing there might be trouble brewing, made
 themselves scarce.
 </p>
 <p>
 When outside upon the street Maurice hailed a newsboy and purchased a copy
 of every paper he could lay hands on, stuffing some in his pockets and
 reading others as he walked along under the stately trees that line the
 pleasant avenues of the old city. Where could the German armies be? It
 seemed as if obscurity had suddenly swallowed them up. Two were over Metz
 way, of course: the first, the one commanded by General von Steinmetz,
 observing the place; the second, that of Prince Frederick Charles, aiming
 to ascend the right bank of the Moselle in order to cut Bazaine off from
 Paris. But the third army, that of the Crown Prince of Prussia, the army
 that had been victorious at Wissembourg and Froeschwiller and had driven
 our 1st and 5th corps, where was it now, where was it to be located amid
 the tangled mess of contradictory advices? Was it still in camp at Nancy,
 or was it true that it had arrived before Chalons, and was that the reason
 why we had abandoned our camp there in such hot haste, burning our stores,
 clothing, forage, provisions, everything&mdash;property of which the value
 to the nation was beyond compute? And when the different plans with which
 our generals were credited came to be taken into consideration, then there
 was more confusion, a fresh set of contradictory hypotheses to be
 encountered. Maurice had until now been cut off in a measure from the
 outside world, and now for the first time learned what had been the course
 of events in Paris; the blasting effect of defeat upon a populace that had
 been confident of victory, the terrible commotions in the streets, the
 convoking of the Chambers, the fall of the liberal ministry that had
 effected the plebiscite, the abrogation of the Emperor's rank as General
 of the Army and the transfer of the supreme command to Marshal Bazaine.
 The Emperor had been present at the camp of Chalons since the 16th, and
 all the newspapers were filled with a grand council that had been held on
 the 17th, at which Prince Napoleon and some of the generals were present,
 but none of them were agreed upon the decisions that had been arrived at
 outside of the resultant facts, which were that General Trochu had been
 appointed governor of Paris and Marshal MacMahon given the command of the
 army of Chalons, and the inference from this was that the Emperor was to
 be shorn of all his authority. Consternation, irresolution, conflicting
 plans that were laid aside and replaced by fresh ones hour by hour; these
 were the things that everybody felt were in the air. And ever and always
 the question: Where were the German armies? Who were in the right, those
 who asserted that Bazaine had no force worth mentioning in front of him
 and was free to make his retreat through the towns of the north whenever
 he chose to do so, or those who declared that he was already besieged in
 Metz? There was a constantly recurring rumor of a series of engagements
 that had raged during an entire week, from the 14th until the 20th, but it
 failed to receive confirmation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's legs ached with fatigue; he went and sat down upon a bench.
 Around him the life of the city seemed to be going on as usual; there were
 nursemaids seated in the shade of the handsome trees watching the sports
 of their little charges, small property owners strolled leisurely about
 the walks enjoying their daily constitutional. He had taken up his papers
 again, when his eyes lighted on an article that had escaped his notice,
 the "leader" in a rabid republican sheet; then everything was made clear
 to him. The paper stated that at the council of the 17th at the camp of
 Chalons the retreat of the army on Paris had been fully decided on, and
 that General Trochu's appointment to the command of the city had no other
 object than to facilitate the Emperor's return; but those resolutions, the
 journal went on to say, were rendered unavailing by the attitude of the
 Empress-regent and the new ministry. It was the Empress's opinion that the
 Emperor's return would certainly produce a revolution; she was reported to
 have said: "He will never reach the Tuileries alive." Starting with these
 premises she insisted with the utmost urgency that the army should
 advance, at every risk, whatever might be the cost of human life, and
 effect a junction with the army of Metz, in which course she was supported
 moreover by General de Palikao, the Minister of War, who had a plan of his
 own for reaching Bazaine by a rapid and victorious march. And Maurice,
 letting his paper fall from his hand, his eyes bent on space, believed
 that he now had the key to the entire mystery; the two conflicting plans,
 MacMahon's hesitation to undertake that dangerous flank movement with the
 unreliable army at his command, the impatient orders that came to him from
 Paris, each more tart and imperative than its predecessor, urging him on
 to that mad, desperate enterprise. Then, as the central figure in that
 tragic conflict, the vision of the Emperor suddenly rose distinctly before
 his inner eyes, deprived of his imperial authority, which he had committed
 to the hands of the Empress-regent, stripped of his military command,
 which he had conferred on Marshal Bazaine; a nullity, the vague and
 unsubstantial shadow of an emperor, a nameless, cumbersome nonentity whom
 no one knew what to do with, whom Paris rejected and who had ceased to
 have a position in the army, for he had pledged himself to issue no
 further orders.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next morning, however, after a rainy night through which he slept
 outside his tent on the bare ground, wrapped in his rubber blanket,
 Maurice was cheered by the tidings that the retreat on Paris had finally
 carried the day. Another council had been held during the night, it was
 said, at which M. Rouher, the former vice-Emperor, had been present; he
 had been sent by the Empress to accelerate the movement toward Verdun, and
 it would seem that the marshal had succeeded in convincing him of the
 rashness of such an undertaking. Were there unfavorable tidings from
 Bazaine? no one could say for certain. But the absence of news was itself
 a circumstance of evil omen, and all among the most influential of the
 generals had cast their vote for the march on Paris, for which they would
 be the relieving army. And Maurice, happy in the conviction that the
 retrograde movement would commence not later than the morrow, since the
 orders for it were said to be already issued, thought he would gratify a
 boyish longing that had been troubling him for some time past, to give the
 go-by for one day to soldier's fare, to wit and eat his breakfast off a
 cloth, with the accompaniment of plate, knife and fork, carafe, and a
 bottle of good wine, things of which it seemed to him that he had been
 deprived for months and months. He had money in his pocket, so off he
 started with quickened pulse, as if going out for a lark, to search for a
 place of entertainment.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was just at the entrance of the village of Courcelles, across the
 canal, that he found the breakfast for which his mouth was watering. He
 had been told the day before that the Emperor had taken up his quarters in
 one of the houses of the village, and having gone to stroll there out of
 curiosity, now remembered to have seen at the junction of the two roads
 this little inn with its arbor, the trellises of which were loaded with
 big clusters of ripe, golden, luscious grapes. There was an array of
 green-painted tables set out in the shade of the luxuriant vine, while
 through the open door of the vast kitchen he had caught glimpses of the
 antique clock, the colored prints pasted on the walls, and the comfortable
 landlady watching the revolving spit. It was cheerful, smiling,
 hospitable; a regular type of the good old-fashioned French hostelry.
 </p>
 <p>
 A pretty, white-necked waitress came up and asked him with a great display
 of flashing teeth:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Will monsieur have breakfast?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Of course I will! Give me some eggs, a cutlet, and cheese. And a bottle
 of white wine!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She turned to go; he called her back. "Tell me, is it not in one of those
 houses that the Emperor has his quarters?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "There, monsieur, in that one right before you. Only you can't see it, for
 it is concealed by the high wall with the overhanging trees."
 </p>
 <p>
 He loosed his belt so as to be more at ease in his capote, and entering
 the arbor, chose his table, on which the sunlight, finding its way here
 and there through the green canopy above, danced in little golden
 spangles. And constantly his thoughts kept returning to that high wall
 behind which was the Emperor. A most mysterious house it was, indeed,
 shrinking from the public gaze, even its slated roof invisible. Its
 entrance was on the other side, upon the village street, a narrow winding
 street between dead-walls, without a shop, without even a window to
 enliven it. The small garden in the rear, among the sparse dwellings that
 environed it, was like an island of dense verdure. And across the road he
 noticed a spacious courtyard, surrounded by sheds and stables, crowded
 with a countless train of carriages and baggage-wagons, among which men
 and horses, coming and going, kept up an unceasing bustle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are those all for the service of the Emperor?" he inquired, meaning to
 say something humorous to the girl, who was laying a snow-white cloth upon
 the table.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, for the Emperor himself, and no one else!" she pleasantly replied,
 glad of a chance to show her white teeth once more; and then she went on
 to enumerate the suite from information that she had probably received
 from the stablemen, who had been coming to the inn to drink since the
 preceding day; there were the staff, comprising twenty-five officers, the
 sixty cent-gardes and the half-troop of guides for escort duty, the six
 gendarmes of the provost-guard; then the household, seventy-three persons
 in all, chamberlains, attendants for the table and the bedroom, cooks and
 scullions; then four saddle-horses and two carriages for the Emperor's
 personal use, ten horses for the equerries, eight for the grooms and
 outriders, not mentioning forty-seven post-horses; then a <i>char a banc</i>
 and twelve baggage wagons, two of which, appropriated to the cooks, had
 particularly excited her admiration by reason of the number and variety of
 the utensils they contained, all in the most splendid order.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, sir, you never saw such stew-pans! they shone like silver. And all
 sorts of dishes, and jars and jugs, and lots of things of which it would
 puzzle me to tell the use! And a cellar of wine, claret, burgundy, and
 champagne&mdash;yes! enough to supply a wedding feast."
 </p>
 <p>
 The unusual luxury of the snowy table-cloth and the white wine sparkling
 in his glass sharpened Maurice's appetite; he devoured his two poached
 eggs with a zest that made him fear he was developing epicurean tastes.
 When he turned to the left and looked out through the entrance of the
 leafy arbor he had before him the spacious plain, covered with long rows
 of tents: a busy, populous city that had risen like an exhalation from the
 stubble-fields between Rheims city and the canal. A few clumps of stunted
 trees, three wind-mills lifting their skeleton arms in the air, were all
 there was to relieve the monotony of the gray waste, but above the huddled
 roofs of Rheims, lost in the sea of foliage of the tall chestnut-trees,
 the huge bulk of the cathedral with its slender spires was profiled
 against the blue sky, looming colossal, notwithstanding the distance,
 beside the modest houses. Memories of school and boyhood's days came over
 him, the tasks he had learned and recited: all about the <i>sacre</i> of
 our kings, the <i>sainte ampoule</i>, Clovis, Jeanne d'Arc, all the long
 list of glories of old France.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Maurice's thoughts reverted again to that unassuming bourgeoise
 house, so mysterious in its solitude, and its imperial occupant; and
 directing his eyes upon the high, yellow wall he was surprised to read,
 scrawled there in great, awkward letters, the legend: <i>Vive Napoleon!</i>
 among the meaningless obscenities traced by schoolboys. Winter's storms
 and summer's sun had half effaced the lettering; evidently the inscription
 was very ancient. How strange, to see upon that wall that old heroic
 battle-cry, which probably had been placed there in honor of the uncle,
 not of the nephew! It brought all his childhood back to him, and Maurice
 was again a boy, scarcely out of his mother's arms, down there in distant
 Chene-Populeux, listening to the stories of his grandfather, a veteran of
 the Grand Army. His mother was dead, his father, in the inglorious days
 that followed the collapse of the empire, had been compelled to accept a
 humble position as collector, and there the grandfather lived, with
 nothing to support him save his scanty pension, in the poor home of the
 small public functionary, his sole comfort to fight his battles o'er again
 for the benefit of his two little twin grandchildren, the boy and the
 girl, a pair of golden-haired youngsters to whom he was in some sense a
 mother. He would place Maurice on his right knee and Henriette on his
 left, and then for hours on end the narrative would run on in Homeric
 strain.
 </p>
 <p>
 But small attention was paid to dates; his story was of the dire shock of
 conflicting nations, and was not to be hampered by the minute exactitude
 of the historian. Successively or together English, Austrians, Prussians,
 Russians appeared upon the scene, according to the then prevailing
 condition of the ever-changing alliances, and it was not always an easy
 matter to tell why one nation received a beating in preference to another,
 but beaten they all were in the end, inevitably beaten from the very
 commencement, in a whirlwind of genius and heroic daring that swept great
 armies like chaff from off the earth. There was Marengo, the classic
 battle of the plain, with the consummate generalship of its broad plan and
 the faultless retreat of the battalions by squares, silent and impassive
 under the enemy's terrible fire; the battle, famous in story, lost at
 three o'clock and won at six, where the eight hundred grenadiers of the
 Consular Guard withstood the onset of the entire Austrian cavalry, where
 Desaix arrived to change impending defeat to glorious victory and die.
 There was Austerlitz, with its sun of glory shining forth from amid the
 wintry sky, Austerlitz, commencing with the capture of the plateau of
 Pratzen and ending with the frightful catastrophe on the frozen lake,
 where an entire Russian corps, men, guns, horses, went crashing through
 the ice, while Napoleon, who in his divine omniscience had foreseen it
 all, of course, directed his artillery to play upon the struggling mass.
 There was Jena, where so many of Prussia's bravest found a grave; at first
 the red flames of musketry flashing through the October mists, and Ney's
 impatience, near spoiling all until Augereau comes wheeling into line and
 saves him; the fierce charge that tore the enemy's center in twain, and
 finally panic, the headlong rout of their boasted cavalry, whom our
 hussars mow down like ripened grain, strewing the romantic glen with a
 harvest of men and horses. And Eylau, cruel Eylau, bloodiest battle of
 them all, where the maimed corpses cumbered the earth in piles; Eylau,
 whose new-fallen snow was stained with blood, the burial-place of heroes;
 Eylau, in whose name reverberates still the thunder of the charge of
 Murat's eighty squadrons, piercing the Russian lines in every direction,
 heaping the ground so thick with dead that Napoleon himself could not
 refrain from tears. Then Friedland, the trap into which the Russians again
 allowed themselves to be decoyed like a flock of brainless sparrows, the
 masterpiece of the Emperor's consummate strategy; our left held back as in
 a leash, motionless, without a sign of life, while Ney was carrying the
 city, street by street, and destroying the bridges, then the left hurled
 like a thunderbolt on the enemy's right, driving it into the river and
 annihilating it in that <i>cul-de-sac</i>; the slaughter so great that at
 ten o'clock at night the bloody work was not completed, most wonderful of
 all the successes of the great imperial epic. And Wagram, where it was the
 aim of the Austrians to cut us off from the Danube; they keep
 strengthening their left in order to overwhelm Massena, who is wounded and
 issues his orders from an open carriage, and Napoleon, like a malicious
 Titan, lets them go on unchecked; then all at once a hundred guns vomit
 their terrible fire upon their weakened center, driving it backward more
 than a league, and their left, terror-stricken to find itself unsupported,
 gives way before the again victorious Massena, sweeping away before it the
 remainder of the army, as when a broken dike lets loose its torrents upon
 the fields. And finally the Moskowa, where the bright sun of Austerlitz
 shone for the last time; where the contending hosts were mingled in
 confused <i>melee</i> amid deeds of the most desperate daring: mamelons
 carried under an unceasing fire of musketry, redoubts stormed with the
 naked steel, every inch of ground fought over again and again; such
 determined resistance on the part of the Russian Guards that our final
 victory was only assured by Murat's mad charges, the concentrated fire of
 our three hundred pieces of artillery, and the valor of Ney, who was the
 hero of that most obstinate of conflicts. And be the battle what it might,
 ever our flags floated proudly on the evening air, and as the bivouac
 fires were lighted on the conquered field out rang the old battle-cry: <i>Vive
 Napoleon!</i> France, carrying her invincible Eagles from end to end of
 Europe, seemed everywhere at home, having but to raise her finger to make
 her will respected by the nations, mistress of a world that in vain
 conspired to crush her and upon which she set her foot.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was contentedly finishing his cutlet, cheered not so much by the
 wine that sparkled in his glass as by the glorious memories that were
 teeming in his brain, when his glance encountered two ragged, dust-stained
 soldiers, less like soldiers than weary tramps just off the road; they
 were asking the attendant for information as to the position of the
 regiments that were encamped along the canal. He hailed them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo there, comrades, this way! You are 7th corps men, aren't you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Right you are, sir; 1st division&mdash;at least I am, more by token that
 I was at Froeschwiller, where it was warm enough, I can tell you. The
 comrade, here, belongs in the 1st corps; he was at Wissembourg, another
 beastly hole."
 </p>
 <p>
 They told their story, how they had been swept away in the general panic,
 had crawled into a ditch half-dead with fatigue and hunger, each of them
 slightly wounded, and since then had been dragging themselves along in the
 rear of the army, compelled to lie over in towns when the fever-fits came
 on, until at last they had reached the camp and were on the lookout to
 find their regiments.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who had a piece of Gruyere before him, noticed the hungry eyes
 fixed on his plate.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hi there, mademoiselle! bring some more cheese, will you&mdash;and bread
 and wine. You will join me, won't you, comrades? It is my treat. Here's to
 your good health!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They drew their chairs up to the table, only too delighted with the
 invitation. Their entertainer watched them as they attacked the food, and
 a thrill of pity ran through him as he beheld their sorry plight, dirty,
 ragged, arms gone, their sole attire a pair of red trousers and the
 capote, kept in place by bits of twine and so patched and pieced with
 shreds of vari-colored cloth that one would have taken them for men who
 had been looting some battle-field and were wearing the spoil they had
 gathered there.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! <i>foutre</i>, yes!" continued the taller of the two as he plied his
 jaws, "it was no laughing matter there! You ought to have seen it,&mdash;tell
 him how it was, Coutard."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the little man told his story with many gestures, describing figures
 on the air with his bread.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I was washing my shirt, you see, while the rest of them were making soup.
 Just try and picture to yourself a miserable hole, a regular trap, all
 surrounded by dense woods that gave those Prussian pigs a chance to crawl
 up to us before we ever suspected they were there. So, then, about seven
 o'clock the shells begin to come tumbling about our ears. <i>Nom de Dieu!</i>
 but it was lively work! we jumped for our shooting-irons, and up to eleven
 o'clock it looked as if we were going to polish 'em off in fine style. But
 you must know that there were only five thousand of us, and the beggars
 kept coming, coming as if there was no end to them. I was posted on a
 little hill, behind a bush, and I could see them debouching in front, to
 right, to left, like rows of black ants swarming from their hill, and when
 you thought there were none left there were always plenty more. There's no
 use mincing matters, we all thought that our leaders must be first-class
 nincompoops to thrust us into such a hornet's nest, with no support at
 hand, and leave us to be crushed there without coming to our assistance.
 And then our General, Douay,[*] poor devil! neither a fool nor a coward,
 that man,&mdash;a bullet comes along and lays him on his back. That ended
 it; no one left to command us! No matter, though, we kept on fighting all
 the same; but they were too many for us, we had to fall back at last. We
 held the railway station for a long time, and then we fought behind a
 wall, and the uproar was enough to wake the dead. And then, when the city
 was taken, I don't exactly remember how it came about, but we were upon a
 mountain, the Geissberg, I think they call it, and there we intrenched
 ourselves in a sort of castle, and how we did give it to the pigs! they
 jumped about the rocks like kids, and it was fun to pick 'em off and see
 'em tumble on their nose. But what would you have? they kept coming,
 coming, all the time, ten men to our one, and all the artillery they could
 wish for. Courage is a very good thing in its place, but sometimes it gets
 a man into difficulties, and so, at last, when it got too hot to stand it
 any longer, we cut and run. But regarded as nincompoops, our officers were
 a decided success; don't you think so, Picot?"
 </p>
 <p>
 [*] This was Abel Douay&mdash;not to be confounded with his brother,
 Felix, who commanded the 7th corps.-TR.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a brief interval of silence. Picot tossed off a glass of the
 white wine and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Of course," said he. "It was just the same at Froeschwiller; the general
 who would give battle under such circumstances is a fit subject for a
 lunatic asylum. That's what my captain said, and he's a little man who
 knows what he is talking about. The truth of the matter is that no one
 knew anything; we were only forty thousand strong, and we were surprised
 by a whole army of those pigs. And no one was expecting to fight that day;
 battle was joined by degrees, one portion after another of our troops
 became engaged, against the wishes of our commanders, as it seems. Of
 course, I didn't see the whole of the affair, but what I do know is that
 the dance lasted by fits and starts all day long; a body would think it
 was ended; not a bit of it! away would go the music more furiously than
 ever. The commencement was at Woerth, a pretty little village with a funny
 clock-tower that looks like a big stove, owing to the earthenware tiles
 they have stuck all over it. I'll be hanged if I know why we let go our
 hold of it that morning, for we broke all our teeth and nails trying to
 get it back again in the afternoon, without succeeding. Oh, my children,
 if I were to tell you of the slaughter there, the throats that were cut
 and the brains knocked out, you would refuse to believe me! The next place
 where we had trouble was around a village with the jaw-breaking name of
 Elsasshausen. We got a peppering from a lot of guns that banged away at us
 at their ease from the top of a blasted hill that we had also abandoned
 that morning, why, no one has ever been able to tell. And there it was
 that with these very eyes of mine I saw the famous charge of the
 cuirassiers. Ah, how gallantly they rode to their death, poor fellows! A
 shame it was, I say, to let men and horses charge over ground like that,
 covered with brush and furze, cut up by ditches. And on top of it all, <i>nom
 de Dieu!</i> what good could they accomplish? But it was very <i>chic</i>
 all the same; it was a beautiful sight to see. The next thing for us to
 do, shouldn't you suppose so? was to go and sit down somewhere and try to
 get our wind again. They had set fire to the village and it was burning
 like tinder, and the whole gang of Bavarian, Wurtemburgian and Prussian
 pigs, more than a hundred and twenty thousand of them there were, as we
 found out afterward, had got around into our rear and on our flanks. But
 there was to be no rest for us then, for just at that time the fiddles
 began to play again a livelier tune than ever around Froeschwiller. For
 there's no use talking, fellows, MacMahon may be a blockhead but he is a
 brave man; you ought to have seen him on his big horse, with the shells
 bursting all about him! The best thing to do would have been to give
 leg-bail at the beginning, for it is no disgrace to a general to refuse to
 fight an army of superior numbers, but he, once we had gone in, was bound
 to see the thing through to the end. And see it through he did! why, I
 tell you that the men down in Froeschwiller were no longer human beings;
 they were ravening wolves devouring one another. For near two hours the
 gutters ran red with blood. All the same, however, we had to knuckle under
 in the end. And to think that after it was all over they should come and
 tell us that we had whipped the Bavarians over on our left! By the piper
 that played before Moses, if we had only had a hundred and twenty thousand
 men, if <i>we</i> had had guns, and leaders with a little pluck!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Loud and angry were the denunciations of Coutard and Picot in their
 ragged, dusty uniforms as they cut themselves huge slices of bread and
 bolted bits of cheese, evoking their bitter memories there in the shade of
 the pretty trellis, where the sun played hide and seek among the purple
 and gold of the clusters of ripening grapes. They had come now to the
 horrible flight that succeeded the defeat; the broken, demoralized,
 famishing regiments flying through the fields, the highroads blocked with
 men, horses, wagons, guns, in inextricable confusion; all the wreck and
 ruin of a beaten army that pressed on, on, on, with the chill breath of
 panic on their backs. As they had not had wit enough to fall back while
 there was time and take post among the passes of the Vosges, where ten
 thousand men would have sufficed to hold in check a hundred thousand, they
 should at least have blown up the bridges and destroyed the tunnels; but
 the generals had lost their heads, and both sides were so dazed, each was
 so ignorant of the other's movements, that for a time each of them was
 feeling to ascertain the position of its opponent, MacMahon hurrying off
 toward Luneville, while the Crown Prince of Prussia was looking for him in
 the direction of the Vosges. On the 7th the remnant of the 1st corps
 passed through Saverne, like a swollen stream that carries away upon its
 muddy bosom all with which it comes in contact. On the 8th, at Sarrebourg,
 the 5th corps came tumbling in upon the 1st, like one mad mountain torrent
 pouring its waters into another. The 5th was also flying, defeated without
 having fought a battle, sweeping away with it its commander, poor General
 de Failly, almost crazy with the thought that to his inactivity was
 imputed the responsibility of the defeat, when the fault all rested in the
 Marshal's having failed to send him orders. The mad flight continued on
 the 9th and 10th, a stampede in which no one turned to look behind him. On
 the 11th, in order to turn Nancy, which a mistaken rumor had reported to
 be occupied by the enemy, they made their way in a pouring rainstorm to
 Bayon; the 12th they camped at Haroue, the 13th at Vicherey, and on the
 14th were at Neufchateau, where at last they struck the railroad, and for
 three days the work went on of loading the weary men into the cars that
 were to take them to Chalons. Twenty-four hours after the last train
 rolled out of the station the Prussians entered the town. "Ah, the cursed
 luck!" said Picot in conclusion; "how we had to ply our legs! And we who
 should by rights have been in hospital!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Coutard emptied what was left in the bottle into his own and his comrade's
 glass. "Yes, we got on our pins, somehow, and are running yet. Bah! it is
 the best thing for us, after all, since it gives us a chance to drink the
 health of those who were not knocked over."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice saw through it all. The sledge hammer blow of Froeschwiller,
 following so close on the heels of the idiotic surprise at Wissembourg,
 was the lightning flash whose baleful light disclosed to him the entire
 naked, terrible truth. We were taken unprepared; we had neither guns, nor
 men, nor generals, while our despised foe was an innumerable host,
 provided with all modern appliances and faultless in discipline and
 leadership. The three German armies had burst apart the weak line of our
 seven corps, scattered between Metz and Strasbourg, like three powerful
 wedges. We were doomed to fight our battle out unaided; nothing could be
 hoped for now from Austria and Italy, for all the Emperor's plans were
 disconcerted by the tardiness of our operations and the incapacity of the
 commanders. Fate, even, seemed to be working against us, heaping all sorts
 of obstacles and ill-timed accidents in our path and favoring the secret
 plan of the Prussians, which was to divide our armies, throwing one
 portion back on Metz, where it would be cut off from France, while they,
 having first destroyed the other fragment, should be marching on Paris. It
 was as plain now as a problem in mathematics that our defeat would be
 owing to causes that were patent to everyone; it was bravery without
 intelligent guidance pitted against numbers and cold science. Men might
 discuss the question as they would in after days; happen what might,
 defeat was certain in spite of everything, as certain and inexorable as
 the laws of nature that rule our planet.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the midst of his uncheerful revery, Maurice's eyes suddenly lighted on
 the legend scrawled on the wall before him&mdash;<i>Vive Napoleon!</i> and
 a sensation of intolerable distress seemed to pierce his heart like a red
 hot iron. Could it be true, then, that France, whose victories were the
 theme of song and story everywhere, the great nation whose drums had
 sounded throughout the length and breadth of Europe, had been thrown in
 the dust at the first onset by an insignificant race, despised of
 everyone? Fifty years had sufficed to compass it; the world had changed,
 and defeat most fearful had overtaken those who had been deemed
 invincible. He remembered the words that had been uttered by Weiss his
 brother-in-law, during that evening of anxiety when they were at
 Mulhausen. Yes, he alone of them had been clear of vision, had penetrated
 the hidden causes that had long been slowly sapping our strength, had felt
 the freshening gale of youth and progress under the impulse of which
 Germany was being wafted onward to prosperity and power. Was not the old
 warlike age dying and a new one coming to the front? Woe to that one among
 the nations which halted in its onward march! the victory is to those who
 are with the advance-guard, to those who are clear of head and strong of
 body, to the most powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
 But just then there came from the smoke-blackened kitchen, where the walls
 were bright with the colored prints of Epinal, a sound of voices and the
 squalling of a girl who submits, not unwillingly, to be tousled. It was
 Lieutenant Rochas, availing himself of his privilege as a conquering hero,
 to catch and kiss the pretty waitress. He came out into the arbor, where
 he ordered a cup of coffee to be served him, and as he had heard the
 concluding words of Picot's narrative, proceeded to take a hand in the
 conversation:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bah! my children, those things that you are speaking of don't amount to
 anything. It is only the beginning of the dance; you will see the fun
 commence in earnest presently. <i>Pardi</i>! up to the present time they
 have been five to our one, but things are going to take a change now; just
 put that in your pipe and smoke it. We are three hundred thousand strong
 here, and every move we make, which nobody can see through, is made with
 the intention of bringing the Prussians down on us, while Bazaine, who has
 got his eye on them, will take them in their rear. And then we'll smash
 'em, <i>crac</i>! just as I smash this fly!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bringing his hands together with a sounding clap he caught and crushed a
 fly on the wing, and he laughed loud and cheerily, believing with all his
 simple soul in the feasibility of a plan that seemed so simple, steadfast
 in his faith in the invincibility of French courage. He good-naturedly
 informed the two soldiers of the exact position of their regiments, then
 lit a cigar and seated himself contentedly before his <i>demitasse</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The pleasure was all mine, comrades!" Maurice replied to Coutard and
 Picot, who, as they were leaving, thanked him for the cheese and wine.
 </p>
 <p>
 He had also called for a cup of coffee and sat watching the Lieutenant,
 whose hopefulness had communicated itself to him, a little surprised,
 however, to hear him enumerate their strength at three hundred thousand
 men, when it was not more than a hundred thousand, and at his
 happy-go-lucky way of crushing the Prussians between the two armies of
 Chalons and Metz. But then he, too, felt such need of some comforting
 illusion! Why should he not continue to hope when all those glorious
 memories of the past that he had evoked were still ringing in his ears?
 The old inn was so bright and cheerful, with its trellis hung with the
 purple grapes of France, ripening in the golden sunlight! And again his
 confidence gained a momentary ascendancy over the gloomy despair that the
 late events had engendered in him.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's eyes had rested for a moment on an officer of chasseurs
 d'Afrique who, with his orderly, had disappeared at a sharp trot around
 the corner of the silent house where the Emperor was quartered, and when
 the orderly came back alone and stopped with his two horses before the inn
 door he gave utterance to an exclamation of surprise:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Prosper! Why, I supposed you were at Metz!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was a young man of Remilly, a simple farm-laborer, whom he had known as
 a boy in the days when he used to go and spend his vacations with his
 uncle Fouchard. He had been drawn, and when the war broke out had been
 three years in Africa; he cut quite a dashing figure in his sky-blue
 jacket, his wide red trousers with blue stripes and red woolen belt, with
 his sun-dried face and strong, sinewy limbs that indicated great strength
 and activity.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo! it's Monsieur Maurice! I'm glad to see you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He took things very easily, however, conducting the steaming horses to the
 stable, and to his own, more particularly, giving a paternal attention. It
 was no doubt his affection for the noble animal, contracted when he was a
 boy and rode him to the plow, that had made him select the cavalry arm of
 the service.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We've just come in from Monthois, more than ten leagues at a stretch," he
 said when he came back, "and Poulet will be wanting his breakfast."
 </p>
 <p>
 Poulet was the horse. He declined to eat anything himself; would only
 accept a cup of coffee. He had to wait for his officer, who had to wait
 for the Emperor; he might be five minutes, and then again he might be two
 hours, so his officer had told him to put the horses in the stable. And as
 Maurice, whose curiosity was aroused, showed some disposition to pump him,
 his face became as vacant as a blank page.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can't say. An errand of some sort&mdash;papers to be delivered."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Rochas looked at the chasseur with an eye of tenderness, for the
 uniform awakened old memories of Africa.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Eh! my lad, where were you stationed out there?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "At Medeah, Lieutenant."
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, Medeah! And drawing their chairs closer together they started a
 conversation, regardless of difference in rank. The life of the desert had
 become a second nature, for Prosper, where the trumpet was continually
 calling them to arms, where a large portion of their time was spent on
 horseback, riding out to battle as they would to the chase, to some grand
 battue of Arabs. There was just one soup-basin for every six men, or
 tribe, as it was called, and each tribe was a family by itself, one of its
 members attending to the cooking, another washing their linen, the others
 pitching the tent, caring for the horses, and cleaning the arms. By day
 they scoured the country beneath a sun like a ball of blazing copper,
 loaded down with the burden of their arms and utensils; at night they
 built great fires to drive away the mosquitoes and sat around them,
 singing the songs of France. Often it happened that in the luminous
 darkness of the night, thick set with stars, they had to rise and restore
 peace among their four-footed friends, who, in the balmy softness of the
 air, had set to biting and kicking one another, uprooting their pickets
 and neighing and snorting furiously. Then there was the delicious coffee,
 their greatest, indeed their only, luxury, which they ground by the
 primitive appliances of a carbine-butt and a porringer, and afterward
 strained through a red woolen sash. But their life was not one of
 unalloyed enjoyment; there were dark days, also, when they were far from
 the abodes of civilized man with the enemy before them. No more fires,
 then; no singing, no good times. There were times when hunger, thirst and
 want of sleep caused them horrible suffering, but no matter; they loved
 that daring, adventurous life, that war of skirmishes, so propitious for
 the display of personal bravery and as interesting as a fairy tale,
 enlivened by the <i>razzias</i>, which were only public plundering on a
 larger scale, and by marauding, or the private peculations of the
 chicken-thieves, which afforded many an amusing story that made even the
 generals laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Prosper, with a more serious face, "it's different here; the
 fighting is done in quite another way."
 </p>
 <p>
 And in reply to a question asked by Maurice, he told the story of their
 landing at Toulon and the long and wearisome march to Luneville. It was
 there that they first received news of Wissembourg and Froeschwiller.
 After that his account was less clear, for he got the names of towns
 mixed, Nancy and Saint-Mihiel, Saint-Mihiel and Metz. There must have been
 heavy fighting on the 14th, for the sky was all on fire, but all he saw of
 it was four uhlans behind a hedge. On the 16th there was another
 engagement; they could hear the artillery going as early as six o'clock in
 the morning, and he had been told that on the 18th they started the dance
 again, more lively than ever. But the chasseurs were not in it that time,
 for at Gravelotte on the 16th, as they were standing drawn up along a road
 waiting to wheel into column, the Emperor, who passed that way in a
 victoria, took them to act as his escort to Verdun. And a pretty little
 jaunt it was, twenty-six miles at a hard gallop, with the fear of being
 cut off by the Prussians at any moment!
 </p>
 <p>
 "And what of Bazaine?" asked Rochas.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bazaine? they say that he is mightily well pleased that the Emperor lets
 him alone."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the Lieutenant wanted to know if Bazaine was coming to join them,
 whereon Prosper made a gesture expressive of uncertainty; what did any one
 know? Ever since the 16th their time had been spent in marching and
 countermarching in the rain, out on reconnoissance and grand-guard duty,
 and they had not seen a sign of an enemy. Now they were part of the army
 of Chalons. His regiment, together with two regiments of chasseurs de
 France and one of hussars, formed one of the divisions of the cavalry of
 reserve, the first division, commanded by General Margueritte, of whom he
 spoke with most enthusiastic warmth.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, the <i>bougre</i>! the enemy will catch a Tartar in him! But what's
 the good talking? the only use they can find for us is to send us
 pottering about in the mud."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was silence for a moment, then Maurice gave some brief news of
 Remilly and uncle Fouchard, and Prosper expressed his regret that he could
 not go and shake hands with Honore, the quartermaster-sergeant, whose
 battery was stationed more than a league away, on the other side of the
 Laon road. But the chasseur pricked up his ears at hearing the whinnying
 of a horse and rose and went out to make sure that Poulet was not in want
 of anything. It was the hour sacred to coffee and <i>pousse-cafe</i>, and
 it was not long before the little hostelry was full to overflowing with
 officers and men of every arm of the service. There was not a vacant
 table, and the bright uniforms shone resplendent against the green
 background of leaves checkered with spots of sunshine. Major Bouroche had
 just come in and taken a seat beside Rochas, when Jean presented himself
 with an order.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lieutenant, the captain desires me to say that he wishes to see you at
 three o'clock on company business."
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas signified by a nod of the head that he had heard, and Jean did not
 go away at once, but stood smiling at Maurice, who was lighting a
 cigarette. Ever since the occurrence in the railway car there had been a
 sort of tacit truce between the two men; they seemed to be reciprocally
 studying each other, with an increasing interest and attraction. But just
 then Prosper came back, a little out of temper.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I mean to have something to eat unless my officer comes out of that
 shanty pretty quick. The Emperor is just as likely as not to stay away
 until dark, confound it all."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Tell me," said Maurice, his curiosity again getting the better of him,
 "isn't it possible that the news you are bringing may be from Bazaine?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Perhaps so. There was a good deal of talk about him down there at
 Monthois."
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment there was a stir outside in the street, and Jean, who was
 standing by one of the doors of the arbor, turned and said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "The Emperor!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Immediately everyone was on his feet. Along the broad, white road, with
 its rows of poplars on either side, came a troop of cent-gardes, spick and
 span in their brilliant uniforms, their cuirasses blazing in the sunlight,
 and immediately behind them rode the Emperor, accompanied by his staff, in
 a wide open space, followed by a second troop of cent-gardes.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a general uncovering of heads, and here and there a hurrah was
 heard; and the Emperor raised his head as he passed; his face looked
 drawn, the eyes were dim and watery. He had the dazed appearance of one
 suddenly aroused from slumber, smiled faintly at sight of the cheerful
 inn, and saluted. From behind them Maurice and Jean distinctly heard old
 Bouroche growl, having first surveyed the sovereign with his practiced
 eye:
 </p>
 <p>
 "There's no mistake about it, that man is in a bad way." Then he
 succinctly completed his diagnosis: "His jig is up!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean shook his head and thought in his limited, common sense way: "It is a
 confounded shame to let a man like that have command of the army!" And ten
 minutes later, when Maurice, comforted by his good breakfast, shook hands
 with Prosper and strolled away to smoke more cigarettes, he carried with
 him the picture of the Emperor, seated on his easy-gaited horse, so pale,
 so gentle, the man of thought, the dreamer, wanting in energy when the
 moment for action came. He was reputed to be good-hearted, capable, swayed
 by generous and noble thoughts, a silent man of strong and tenacious will;
 he was very brave, too, scorning danger with the scorn of the fatalist for
 whom destiny has no fears; but in critical moments a fatal lethargy seemed
 to overcome him; he appeared to become paralyzed in presence of results,
 and powerless thereafter to struggle against Fortune should she prove
 adverse. And Maurice asked himself if his were not a special physiological
 condition, aggravated by suffering; if the indecision and increasing
 incapacity that the Emperor had displayed ever since the opening of the
 campaign were not to be attributed to his manifest illness. That would
 explain everything: a minute bit of foreign substance in a man's system,
 and empires totter.
 </p>
 <p>
 The camp that evening was all astir with activity; officers were bustling
 about with orders and arranging for the start the following morning at
 five o'clock. Maurice experienced a shock of surprise and alarm to learn
 that once again all their plans were changed, that they were not to fall
 back on Paris, but proceed to Verdun and effect a junction with Bazaine.
 There was a report that dispatches had come in during the day from the
 marshal announcing that he was retreating, and the young man's thoughts
 reverted to the officer of chasseurs and his rapid ride from Monthois;
 perhaps he had been the bearer of a copy of the dispatch. So, then, the
 opinions of the Empress-regent and the Council of Ministers had prevailed
 with the vacillating MacMahon, in their dread to see the Emperor return to
 Paris and their inflexible determination to push the army forward in one
 supreme attempt to save the dynasty; and the poor Emperor, that wretched
 man for whom there was no place in all his vast empire, was to be bundled
 to and fro among the baggage of his army like some worthless, worn-out
 piece of furniture, condemned to the irony of dragging behind him in his
 suite his imperial household, cent-gardes, horses, carriages, cooks,
 silver stew-pans and cases of champagne, trailing his flaunting mantle,
 embroidered with the Napoleonic bees, through the blood and mire of the
 highways of his retreat.
 </p>
 <p>
 At midnight Maurice was not asleep; he was feverishly wakeful, and his
 gloomy reflections kept him tossing and tumbling on his pallet. He finally
 arose and went outside, where he found comfort and refreshment in the cool
 night air. The sky was overspread with clouds, the darkness was intense;
 along the front of the line the expiring watch-fires gleamed with a red
 and sullen light at distant intervals, and in the deathlike, boding
 silence could be heard the long-drawn breathing of the hundred thousand
 men who slumbered there. Then Maurice became more tranquil, and there
 descended on him a sentiment of brotherhood, full of compassionate
 kindness for all those slumbering fellow-creatures, of whom thousands
 would soon be sleeping the sleep of death. Brave fellows! True, many of
 them were thieves and drunkards, but think of what they had suffered and
 the excuse there was for them in the universal demoralization! The
 glorious veterans of Solferino and Sebastopol were but a handful,
 incorporated in the ranks of the newly raised troops, too few in number to
 make their example felt. The four corps that had been got together and
 equipped so hurriedly, devoid of every element of cohesion, were the
 forlorn hope, the expiatory band that their rulers were sending to the
 sacrifice in the endeavor to avert the wrath of destiny. They would bear
 their cross to the bitter end, atoning with their life's blood for the
 faults of others, glorious amid disaster and defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
 And then it was that Maurice, there in the darkness that was instinct with
 life, became conscious that a great duty lay before him. He ceased to
 beguile himself with the illusive prospect of great victories to be
 gained; the march to Verdun was a march to death, and he so accepted it,
 since it was their lot to die, with brave and cheerful resignation.

 <h2>
 IV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 On Tuesday, the 23d of August, at six o'clock in the morning, camp was
 broken, and as a stream that has momentarily expanded into a lake resumes
 its course again, the hundred and odd thousand men of the army of Chalons
 put themselves in motion and soon were pouring onward in a resistless
 torrent; and notwithstanding the rumors that had been current since the
 preceding day, it was a great surprise to most to see that instead of
 continuing their retrograde movement they were leaving Paris behind them
 and turning their faces toward the unknown regions of the East.
 </p>
 <p>
 At five o'clock in the morning the 7th corps was still unsupplied with
 cartridges. For two days the artillerymen had been working like beavers to
 unload the <i>materiel</i>, horses, and stores that had been streaming
 from Metz into the overcrowded station, and it was only at the very last
 moment that some cars of cartridges were discovered among the tangled
 trains, and that a detail which included Jean among its numbers was
 enabled to bring back two hundred and forty thousand on carts that they
 had hurriedly requisitioned. Jean distributed the regulation number, one
 hundred cartridges to a man, among his squad, just as Gaude, the company
 bugler, sounded the order to march.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 106th was not to pass through Rheims, their orders being to turn the
 city and debouch into the Chalons road farther on, but on this occasion
 there was the usual failure to regulate the order and time of marching, so
 that, the four corps having commenced to move at the same moment, they
 collided when they came out upon the roads that they were to traverse in
 common and the result was inextricable confusion. Cavalry and artillery
 were constantly cutting in among the infantry and bringing them to a halt;
 whole brigades were compelled to leave the road and stand at ordered arms
 in the plowed fields for more than an hour, waiting until the way should
 be cleared. And to make matters worse, they had hardly left the camp when
 a terrible storm broke over them, the rain pelting down in torrents,
 drenching the men completely and adding intolerably to the weight of
 knapsacks and great-coats. Just as the rain began to hold up, however, the
 106th saw a chance to go forward, while some zouaves in an adjoining
 field, who were forced to wait yet for a while, amused themselves by
 pelting one another with balls of moist earth, and the consequent
 condition of their uniforms afforded them much merriment.
 </p>
 <p>
 The sun suddenly came shining out again in the clear sky, the warm, bright
 sun of an August morning, and with it came returning gayety; the men were
 steaming like a wash of linen hung out to dry in the open air: the
 moisture evaporated from their clothing in little more time than it takes
 to tell it, and when they were warm and dry again, like dogs who shake the
 water from them when they emerge from a pond, they chaffed one another
 good-naturedly on their bedraggled appearance and the splashes of mud on
 their red trousers. Wherever two roads intersected another halt was
 necessitated; the last one was in a little village just beyond the walls
 of the city, in front of a small saloon that seemed to be doing a thriving
 business. Thereon it occurred to Maurice to treat the squad to a drink, by
 way of wishing them all good luck.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Corporal, will you allow me&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, after hesitating a moment, accepted a "pony" of brandy for himself.
 Loubet and Chouteau were of the party (the latter had been watchful and
 submissive since that day when the corporal had evinced a disposition to
 use his heavy fists), and also Pache and Lapoulle, a couple of very decent
 fellows when there was no one to set them a bad example.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Your good health, corporal!" said Chouteau in a respectful, whining tone.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thank you; here's hoping that you may bring back your head and all your
 legs and arms!" Jean politely replied, while the others laughed
 approvingly.
 </p>
 <p>
 But the column was about to move; Captain Beaudoin came up with a
 scandalized look on his face and a reproof at the tip of his tongue, while
 Lieutenant Rochas, more indulgent to the small weaknesses of his men,
 turned his head so as not to see what was going on. And now they were
 stepping out at a good round pace along the Chalons road, which stretched
 before them for many a long league, bordered with trees on either side,
 undeviatingly straight, like a never-ending ribbon unrolled between the
 fields of yellow stubble that were dotted here and there with tall stacks
 and wooden windmills brandishing their lean arms. More to the north were
 rows of telegraph poles, indicating the position of other roads, on which
 they could distinguish the black, crawling lines of other marching
 regiments. In many places the troops had left the highway and were moving
 in deep columns across the open plain. To the left and front a cavalry
 brigade was seen, jogging along at an easy trot in a blaze of sunshine.
 The entire wide horizon, usually so silent and deserted, was alive and
 populous with those streams of men, pressing onward, onward, in long
 drawn, black array, like the innumerable throng of insects from some
 gigantic ant-hill.
 </p>
 <p>
 About nine o'clock the regiment left the Chalons road and wheeled to the
 left into another that led to Suippe, which, like the first, extended,
 straight as an arrow's flight, far as the eye could see. The men marched
 at the route-step in two straggling files along either side of the road,
 thus leaving the central space free for the officers, and Maurice could
 not help noticing their anxious, care-worn air, in striking contrast with
 the jollity and good-humor of the soldiers, who were happy as children to
 be on the move once more. As the squad was near the head of the column he
 could even distinguish the Colonel, M. de Vineuil, in the distance, and
 was impressed by the grave earnestness of his manner, and his tall, rigid
 form, swaying in cadence to the motion of his charger. The band had been
 sent back to the rear, to keep company with the regimental wagons; it
 played but once during that entire campaign. Then came the ambulances and
 engineer's train attached to the division, and succeeding that the corps
 train, an interminable procession of forage wagons, closed vans for
 stores, carts for baggage, and vehicles of every known description,
 occupying a space of road nearly four miles in length, and which, at the
 infrequent curves in the highway, they could see winding behind them like
 the tail of some great serpent. And last of all, at the extreme rear of
 the column, came the herds, "rations on the hoof," a surging, bleating,
 bellowing mass of sheep and oxen, urged on by blows and raising clouds of
 dust, reminding one of the old warlike peoples of the East and their
 migrations.
 </p>
 <p>
 Lapoulle meantime would every now and then give a hitch of his shoulders
 in an attempt to shift the weight of his knapsack when it began to be too
 heavy. The others, alleging that he was the strongest, were accustomed to
 make him carry the various utensils that were common to the squad,
 including the big kettle and the water-pail; on this occasion they had
 even saddled him with the company shovel, assuring him that it was a badge
 of honor. So far was he from complaining that he was now laughing at a
 song with which Loubet, the tenor of the squad, was trying to beguile the
 tedium of the way. Loubet had made himself quite famous by reason of his
 knapsack, in which was to be found a little of everything: linen, an extra
 pair of shoes, haberdashery, chocolate, brushes, a plate and cup, to say
 nothing of his regular rations of biscuit and coffee, and although the
 all-devouring receptacle also contained his cartridges, and his blankets
 were rolled on top of it, together with the shelter-tent and stakes, the
 load nevertheless appeared light, such an excellent system he had of
 packing his trunk, as he himself expressed it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's a beastly country, all the same!" Chouteau kept repeating from time
 to time, casting a look of intense disgust over the dreary plains of
 "lousy Champagne."
 </p>
 <p>
 Broad expanses of chalky ground of a dirty white lay before and around
 them, and seemed to have no end. Not a farmhouse to be seen anywhere, not
 a living being; nothing but flocks of crows, forming small spots of
 blackness on the immensity of the gray waste. On the left, far away in the
 distance, the low hills that bounded the horizon in that direction were
 crowned by woods of somber pines, while on the right an unbroken wall of
 trees indicated the course of the river Vesle. But over there behind the
 hills they had seen for the last hour a dense smoke was rising, the heavy
 clouds of which obscured the sky and told of a dreadful conflagration
 raging at no great distance.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is burning over there?" was the question that was on the lips of
 everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
 The answer was quickly given and ran through the column from front to
 rear. The camp of Chalons had been fired, it was said, by order of the
 Emperor, to keep the immense collection of stores there from falling into
 the hands of the Prussians, and for the last two days it had been going up
 in flame and smoke. The cavalry of the rear-guard had been instructed to
 apply the torch to two immense warehouses, filled with tents, tent-poles,
 mattresses, clothing, shoes, blankets, mess utensils, supplies of every
 kind sufficient for the equipment of a hundred thousand men. Stacks of
 forage also had been lighted, and were blazing like huge beacon-fires, and
 an oppressive silence settled down upon the army as it pursued its march
 across the wide, solitary plain at sight of that dusky, eddying column
 that rose from behind the distant hills, filling the heavens with
 desolation. All that was to be heard in the bright sunlight was the
 measured tramp of many feet upon the hollow ground, while involuntarily
 the eyes of all were turned on that livid cloud whose baleful shadows
 rested on their march for many a league.
 </p>
 <p>
 Their spirits rose again when they made their midday halt in a field of
 stubble, where the men could seat themselves on their unslung knapsacks
 and refresh themselves with a bite. The large square biscuits could only
 be eaten by crumbling them in the soup, but the little round ones were
 quite a delicacy, light and appetizing; the only trouble was that they
 left an intolerable thirst behind them. Pache sang a hymn, being invited
 thereto, the squad joining in the chorus. Jean smiled good-naturedly
 without attempting to check them in their amusement, while Maurice, at
 sight of the universal cheerfulness and the good order with which their
 first day's march was conducted, felt a revival of confidence. The
 remainder of the allotted task of the day was performed with the same
 light-hearted alacrity, although the last five miles tried their
 endurance. They had abandoned the high road, leaving the village of
 Prosnes to their right, in order to avail themselves of a short cut across
 a sandy heath diversified by an occasional thin pine wood, and the entire
 division, with its interminable train at its heels, turned and twisted in
 and out among the trees, sinking ankle deep in the yielding sand at every
 step. It seemed as if the cheerless waste would never end; all that they
 met was a flock of very lean sheep, guarded by a big black dog.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was about four o'clock when at last the 106th halted for the night at
 Dontrien, a small village on the banks of the Suippe. The little stream
 winds among some pretty groves of trees; the old church stands in the
 middle of the graveyard, which is shaded in its entire extent by a
 magnificent chestnut. The regiment pitched its tents on the left bank, in
 a meadow that sloped gently down to the margin of the river. The officers
 said that all the four corps would bivouac that evening on the line of the
 Suippe between Auberive and Hentregiville, occupying the intervening
 villages of Dontrien, Betheniville and Pont-Faverger, making a line of
 battle nearly five leagues long.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gaude immediately gave the call for "distribution," and Jean had to run
 for it, for the corporal was steward-in-chief, and it behooved him to be
 on the lookout to protect his men's interests. He had taken Lapoulle with
 him, and in a quarter of an hour they returned with some ribs of beef and
 a bundle of firewood. In the short space of time succeeding their arrival
 three steers of the herd that followed the column had been knocked in the
 head under a great oak-tree, skinned, and cut up. Lapoulle had to return
 for bread, which the villagers of Dontrien had been baking all that
 afternoon in their ovens. There was really no lack of anything on that
 first day, setting aside wine and tobacco, with which the troops were to
 be obliged to dispense during the remainder of the campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
 Upon Jean's return he found Chouteau engaged in raising the tent, assisted
 by Pache; he looked at them for a moment with the critical eye of an old
 soldier who had no great opinion of their abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It will do very well if the weather is fine to-night," he said at last,
 "but if it should come on to blow we would like enough wake up and find
 ourselves in the river. Let me show you."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he was about to send Maurice with the large pail for water, but the
 young man had sat down on the ground, taken off his shoe, and was
 examining his right foot.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo, there! what's the matter with you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "My shoe has chafed my foot and raised a blister. My other shoes were worn
 out, and when we were at Rheims I bought these, like a big fool, because
 they were a good fit. I should have selected gunboats."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean kneeled and took the foot in his hand, turning it over as carefully
 as if it had been a little child's, with a disapproving shake of his head.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You must be careful; it is no laughing matter, a thing like that. A
 soldier without the use of his feet is of no good to himself or anyone
 else. When we were in Italy my captain used always to say that it is the
 men's legs that win battles."
 </p>
 <p>
 He bade Pache go for the water, no very hard task, as the river was but a
 few yards away, and Loubet, having in the meantime dug a shallow trench
 and lit his fire, was enabled to commence operations on his <i>pot-au-feu</i>,
 which he did by putting on the big kettle full of water and plunging into
 it the meat that he had previously corded together with a bit of twine, <i>secundum
 artem</i>. Then it was solid comfort for them to watch the boiling of the
 soup; the whole squad, their chores done up and their day's labor ended,
 stretched themselves on the grass around the fire in a family group, full
 of tender anxiety for the simmering meat, while Loubet occasionally
 stirred the pot with a gravity fitted to the importance of his position.
 Like children and savages, their sole instinct was to eat and sleep,
 careless of the morrow, while advancing to face unknown risks and dangers.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice had unpacked his knapsack and come across a newspaper that he
 had bought at Rheims, and Chouteau asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is there anything about the Prussians in it? Read us the news!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They were a happy family under Jean's mild despotism. Maurice
 good-naturedly read such news as he thought might interest them, while
 Pache, the seamstress of the company, mended his greatcoat for him and
 Lapoulle cleaned his musket. The first item was a splendid victory won by
 Bazaine, who had driven an entire Prussian corps into the quarries of
 Jaumont, and the trumped-up tale was told with an abundance of dramatic
 detail, how men and horses went over the precipice and were crushed on the
 rocks beneath out of all semblance of humanity, so that there was not one
 whole corpse found for burial. Then there were minute details of the
 pitiable condition of the German armies ever since they had invaded
 France: the ill-fed, poorly equipped soldiers were actually falling from
 inanition and dying by the roadside of horrible diseases. Another article
 told how the king of Prussia had the diarrhea, and how Bismarck had broken
 his leg in jumping from the window of an inn where a party of zouaves had
 just missed capturing him. Capital news! Lapoulle laughed over it as if he
 would split his sides, while Chouteau and the others, without expressing
 the faintest doubt, chuckled at the idea that soon they would be picking
 up Prussians as boys pick up sparrows in a field after a hail-storm. But
 they laughed loudest at old Bismarck's accident; oh! the zouaves and the
 turcos, they were the boys for one's money! It was said that the Germans
 were in an ecstasy of fear and rage, declaring that it was unworthy of a
 nation that claimed to be civilized to employ such heathen savages in its
 armies. Although they had been decimated at Froeschwiller, the foreign
 troops seemed to have a good deal of life left in them.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was just striking six from the steeple of the little church of Dontrien
 when Loubet shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come to supper!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The squad lost no time in seating themselves in a circle. At the very last
 moment Loubet had succeeded in getting some vegetables from a peasant who
 lived hard by. That made the crowning glory of the feast: a soup perfumed
 with carrots and onions, that went down the throat soft as velvet&mdash;what
 could they have desired more? The spoons rattled merrily in the little
 wooden bowls. Then it devolved on Jean, who always served the portions, to
 distribute the beef, and it behooved him that day to do it with the
 strictest impartiality, for hungry eyes were watching him and there would
 have been a growl had anyone received a larger piece than his neighbors.
 They concluded by licking the porringers, and were smeared with soup up to
 their eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>nom de Dieu!</i>" Chouteau declared when he had finished, throwing
 himself flat on his back; "I would rather take that than a beating, any
 day!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, too, whose foot pained him less now that he could give it a
 little rest, was conscious of that sensation of well-being that is the
 result of a full stomach. He was beginning to take more kindly to his
 rough companions, and to bring himself down nearer to their level under
 the pressure of the physical necessities of their life in common. That
 night he slept the same deep sleep as did his five tent-mates; they all
 huddled close together, finding the sensation of animal warmth not
 disagreeable in the heavy dew that fell. It is necessary to state that
 Lapoulle, at the instigation of Loubet, had gone to a stack not far away
 and feloniously appropriated a quantity of straw, in which our six
 gentlemen snored as if it had been a bed of down. And from Auberive to
 Hentregiville, along the pleasant banks of the Suippe as it meandered
 sluggishly between its willows, the fires of those hundred thousand
 sleeping men illuminated the starlit night for fifteen miles, like a long
 array of twinkling stars.
 </p>
 <p>
 At sunrise they made coffee, pulverizing the berries in a wooden bowl with
 a musket-butt, throwing the powder into boiling water, and settling it
 with a drop of cold water. The luminary rose that morning in a bank of
 purple and gold, affording a spectacle of royal magnificence, but Maurice
 had no eye for such displays, and Jean, with the weather-wisdom of a
 peasant, cast an anxious glance at the red disk, which presaged rain; and
 it was for that reason that, the surplus of bread baked the day before
 having been distributed and the squad having received three loaves, he
 reproved severely Loubet and Pache for making them fast on the outside of
 their knapsacks; but the tents were folded and the knapsacks packed, and
 so no one paid any attention to him. Six o'clock was sounding from all the
 bells of the village when the army put itself in motion and stoutly
 resumed its advance in the bright hopefulness of the dawn of the new day.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 106th, in order to reach the road that leads from Rheims to Vouziers,
 struck into a cross-road, and for more than an hour their way was an
 ascending one. Below them, toward the north, Betheniville was visible
 among the trees, where the Emperor was reported to have slept, and when
 they reached the Vouziers road the level country of the preceding day
 again presented itself to their gaze and the lean fields of "lousy
 Champagne" stretched before them in wearisome monotony. They now had the
 Arne, an insignificant stream, flowing on their left, while to the right
 the treeless, naked country stretched far as the eye could see in an
 apparently interminable horizon. They passed through a village or two:
 Saint-Clement, with its single winding street bordered by a double row of
 houses, Saint-Pierre, a little town of miserly rich men who had barricaded
 their doors and windows. The long halt occurred about ten o'clock, near
 another village, Saint-Etienne, where the men were highly delighted to
 find tobacco once more. The 7th corps had been cut up into several
 columns, and the 106th headed one of these columns, having behind it only
 a battalion of chasseurs and the reserve artillery. Maurice turned his
 head at every bend in the road to catch a glimpse of the long train that
 had so excited his interest the day before, but in vain; the herds had
 gone off in some other direction, and all he could see was the guns,
 looming inordinately large upon those level plains, like monster insects
 of somber mien.
 </p>
 <p>
 After leaving Saint-Etienne, however, there was a change for the worse,
 and the road from bad became abominable, rising by an easy ascent between
 great sterile fields in which the only signs of vegetation were the
 everlasting pine woods with their dark verdure, forming a dismal contrast
 with the gray-white soil. It was the most forlorn spot they had seen yet.
 The ill-paved road, washed by the recent rains, was a lake of mud, of
 tenacious, slippery gray clay, which held the men's feet like so much
 pitch. It was wearisome work; the troops were exhausted and could not get
 forward, and as if things were not bad enough already, the rain suddenly
 began to come down most violently. The guns were mired and had to be left
 in the road.
 </p>
 <p>
 Chouteau, who had been given the squad's rice to carry, fatigued and
 exasperated with his heavy load, watched for an opportunity when no one
 was looking and dropped the package. But Loubet had seen him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, that's no way! you ought not to do that. The comrades will be
 hungry by and by."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let be!" replied Chouteau. "There is plenty of rice; they will give us
 more at the end of the march."
 </p>
 <p>
 And Loubet, who had the bacon, convinced by such cogent reasoning, dropped
 his load in turn.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was suffering more and more with his foot, of which the heel was
 badly inflamed. He limped along in such a pitiable state that Jean's
 sympathy was aroused.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Does it hurt? is it no better, eh?" And as the men were halted just then
 for a breathing spell, he gave him a bit of good advice. "Take off your
 shoe and go barefoot; the cool earth will ease the pain."
 </p>
 <p>
 And in that way Maurice found that he could keep up with his comrades with
 some degree of comfort; he experienced a sentiment of deep gratitude. It
 was a piece of great good luck that their squad had a corporal like him, a
 man who had seen service and knew all the tricks of the trade: he was an
 uncultivated peasant, of course, but a good fellow all the same.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was late when they reached their place of bivouac at Contreuve, after
 marching a long time on the Chalons and Vouziers road and descending by a
 steep path into the valley of the Semide, up which they came through a
 stretch of narrow meadows. The landscape had undergone a change; they were
 now in the Ardennes, and from the lofty hills above the village where the
 engineers had staked off the ground for the 7th corps' camp, the valley of
 the Aisne was dimly visible in the distance, veiled in the pale mists of
 the passing shower.
 </p>
 <p>
 Six o'clock came and there had been no distribution of rations, whereon
 Jean, in order to keep occupied, apprehensive also of the consequences
 that might result from the high wind that was springing up, determined to
 attend in person to the setting up of the tent. He showed his men how it
 should be done, selecting a bit of ground that sloped away a little to one
 side, setting the pegs at the proper angle, and digging a little trench
 around the whole to carry off the water. Maurice was excused from the
 usual nightly drudgery on account of his sore foot, and was an interested
 witness of the intelligence and handiness of the big young fellow whose
 general appearance was so stolid and ungainly. He was completely knocked
 up with fatigue, but the confidence that they were now advancing with a
 definite end in view served to sustain him. They had had a hard time of it
 since they left Rheims, making nearly forty miles in two days' marching;
 if they could maintain the pace and if they kept straight on in the
 direction they were pursuing, there could be no doubt that they would
 destroy the second German army and effect a junction with Bazaine before
 the third, the Crown Prince of Prussia's, which was said to be at Vitry-le
 Francois, could get up to Verdun.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, come now! I wonder if they are going to let us starve!" was
 Chouteau's remark when, at seven o'clock, there was still no sign of
 rations.
 </p>
 <p>
 By way of taking time by the forelock, Jean had instructed Loubet to light
 the fire and put on the pot, and, as there was no issue of firewood, he
 had been compelled to be blind to the slight irregularity of the
 proceeding when that individual remedied the omission by tearing the
 palings from an adjacent fence. When he suggested knocking up a dish of
 bacon and rice, however, the truth had to come out, and he was informed
 that the rice and bacon were lying in the mud of the Saint-Etienne road.
 Chouteau lied with the greatest effrontery declaring that the package must
 have slipped from his shoulders without his noticing it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are a couple of pigs!" Jean shouted angrily, "to throw away good
 victuals, when there are so many poor devils going with an empty stomach!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the same with the three loaves that had been fastened outside the
 knapsacks; they had not listened to his warning, and the consequence was
 that the rain had soaked the bread and reduced it to paste.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A pretty pickle we are in!" he continued. "We had food in plenty, and now
 here we are, without a crumb! Ah! you are a pair of dirty pigs!"
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment the first sergeant's call was heard, and Sergeant Sapin,
 returning presently with his usual doleful air, informed the men that it
 would be impossible to distribute rations that evening, and that they
 would have to content themselves with what eatables they had on their
 persons. It was reported that the trains had been delayed by the bad
 weather, and as to the herds, they must have straggled off as a result of
 conflicting orders. Subsequently it became known that on that day the 5th
 and 12th corps had got up to Rethel, where the headquarters of the army
 were established, and the inhabitants of the neighboring villages,
 possessed with a mad desire to see the Emperor, had inaugurated a hegira
 toward that town, taking with them everything in the way of provisions; so
 that when the 7th corps came up they found themselves in a land of
 nakedness: no bread, no meat, no people, even. To add to their distress a
 misconception of orders had caused the supplies of the commissary
 department to be directed on Chene-Populeux. This was a state of affairs
 that during the entire campaign formed the despair of the wretched
 commissaries, who had to endure the abuse and execrations of the whole
 army, while their sole fault lay in being punctual at rendezvous at which
 the troops failed to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It serves you right, you dirty pigs!" continued Jean in his wrath, "and
 you don't deserve the trouble that I am going to have in finding you
 something to eat, for I suppose it is my duty not to let you starve, all
 the same." And he started off to see what he could find, as every good
 corporal does under such circumstances, taking with him Pache, who was a
 favorite on account of his quiet manner, although he considered him rather
 too priest-ridden.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Loubet's attention had just been attracted to a little farmhouse, one
 of the last dwellings in Contreuve, some two or three hundred yards away,
 where there seemed to him to be promise of good results. He called
 Chouteau and Lapoulle to him and said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come along, and let's see what we can do. I've a notion there's grub to
 be had over that way."
 </p>
 <p>
 So Maurice was left to keep up the fire and watch the kettle, in which the
 water was beginning to boil. He had seated himself on his blanket and
 taken off his shoe in order to give his blister a chance to heal. It
 amused him to look about the camp and watch the behavior of the different
 squads now that there was to be no issue of rations; the deduction that he
 arrived at was that some of them were in a chronic state of destitution,
 while others reveled in continual abundance, and that these conditions
 were ascribable to the greater or less degree of tact and foresight of the
 corporal and his men. Amid the confusion that reigned about the stacks and
 tents he remarked some squads who had not been able even to start a fire,
 others of which the men had abandoned hope and lain themselves resignedly
 down for the night, while others again were ravenously devouring, no one
 knew what, something good, no doubt. Another thing that impressed him was
 the good order that prevailed in the artillery, which had its camp above
 him, on the hillside. The setting sun peeped out from a rift in the clouds
 and his rays were reflected from the burnished guns, from which the men
 had cleansed the coat of mud that they had picked up along the road.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the meantime General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, commanding the brigade, had
 found quarters suited to his taste in the little farmhouse toward which
 the designs of Loubet and his companions were directed. He had discovered
 something that had the semblance of a bed and was seated at table with a
 roasted chicken and an omelette before him; consequently he was in the
 best of humors, and as Colonel de Vineuil happened in just then on
 regimental business, had invited him to dine. They were enjoying their
 repast, therefore, waited on by a tall, light-haired individual who had
 been in the farmer's service only three days and claimed to be an
 Alsatian, one of those who had been forced to leave their country after
 the disaster of Froeschwiller. The general did not seem to think it
 necessary to use any restraint in presence of the man, commenting freely
 on the movements of the army, and finally, forgetful of the fact that he
 was not an inhabitant of the country, began to question him about
 localities and distances. His questions displayed such utter ignorance of
 the country that the colonel, who had once lived at Mezieres, was
 astounded; he gave such information as he had at command, which elicited
 from the chief the exclamation:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is just like our idiotic government! How can they expect us to fight
 in a country of which we know nothing?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel's face assumed a look of vague consternation. He knew that
 immediately upon the declaration of war maps of Germany had been
 distributed among the officers, while it was quite certain that not one of
 them had a map of France. He was amazed and confounded by what he had seen
 and heard since the opening of the campaign. His unquestioned bravery was
 his distinctive trait; he was a somewhat weak and not very brilliant
 commander, which caused him to be more loved than respected in his
 regiment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's too bad that a man can't eat his dinner in peace!" the general
 suddenly blurted out. "What does all that uproar mean? Go and see what the
 matter is, you Alsatian fellow!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the farmer anticipated him by appearing at the door, sobbing and
 gesticulating like a crazy man. They were robbing him, the zouaves and
 chasseurs were plundering his house. As he was the only one in the village
 who had anything to sell he had foolishly allowed himself to be persuaded
 to open shop. At first he had sold his eggs and chickens, his rabbits, and
 potatoes, without exacting an extortionate profit, pocketing his money and
 delivering the merchandise; then the customers had streamed in in a
 constantly increasing throng, jostling and worrying the old man, finally
 crowding him aside and taking all he had without pretense of payment. And
 thus it was throughout the war; if many peasants concealed their property
 and even denied a drink of water to the thirsty soldier, it was because of
 their fear of the irresistible inroads of that ocean of men, who swept
 everything clean before them, thrusting the wretched owners from their
 houses and beggaring them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Eh! will you hold your tongue, old man!" shouted the general in disgust.
 "Those rascals ought to be shot at the rate of a dozen a day. What is one
 to do?" And to avoid taking the measures that the case demanded he gave
 orders to close the door, while the colonel explained to him that there
 had been no issue of rations and the men were hungry.
 </p>
 <p>
 While these things were going on within the house Loubet outside had
 discovered a field of potatoes; he and Lapoulle scaled the fence and were
 digging the precious tubers with their hands and stuffing their pockets
 with them when Chouteau, who in the pursuit of knowledge was looking over
 a low wall, gave a shrill whistle that called them hurriedly to his side.
 They uttered an exclamation of wonder and delight; there was a flock of
 geese, ten fat, splendid geese, pompously waddling about a small yard. A
 council of war was held forthwith, and it was decided that Lapoulle should
 storm the place and make prisoners of the garrison. The conflict was a
 bloody one; the venerable gander on which the soldier laid his predaceous
 hands had nearly deprived him of his nose with its bill, hard and sharp as
 a tailor's shears. Then he caught it by the neck and tried to choke it,
 but the bird tore his trousers with its strong claws and pummeled him
 about the body with its great wings. He finally ended the battle by
 braining it with his fist, and it had not ceased to struggle when he
 leaped the wall, hotly pursued by the remainder of the flock, pecking
 viciously at his legs.
 </p>
 <p>
 When they got back to camp, with the unfortunate gander and the potatoes
 hidden in a bag, they found that Jean and Pache had also been successful
 in their expedition, and had enriched the common larder with four loaves
 of fresh bread and a cheese that they had purchased from a worthy old
 woman.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The water is boiling and we will make some coffee," said the corporal.
 "Here are bread and cheese; it will be a regular feast!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He could not help laughing, however, when he looked down and saw the goose
 lying at his feet. He raised it, examining and hefting it with the
 judgment of an expert.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! upon my word, a fine bird! it must weigh twenty pounds."
 </p>
 <p>
 "We were out walking and met the bird," Loubet explained in an unctuously
 sanctimonious voice, "and it insisted on making our acquaintance."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean made no reply, but his manner showed that he wished to hear nothing
 more of the matter. Men must live, and then why in the name of common
 sense should not those poor fellows, who had almost forgotten how poultry
 tasted, have a treat once in a way!
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet had already kindled the fire into a roaring blaze; Pache and
 Lapoulle set to work to pluck the goose; Chouteau, who had run off to the
 artillerymen and begged a bit of twine, came back and stretched it between
 two bayonets; the bird was suspended in front of the hot fire and Maurice
 was given a cleaning rod and enjoined to keep it turning. The big tin
 basin was set beneath to catch the gravy. It was a triumph of culinary
 art; the whole regiment, attracted by the savory odor, came and formed a
 circle about the fire and licked their chops. And what a feast it was!
 roast goose, boiled potatoes, bread, cheese, and coffee! When Jean had
 dissected the bird the squad applied itself vigorously to the task before
 it; there was no talk of portions, every man ate as much as he was capable
 of holding. They even sent a plate full over to the artillerymen who had
 furnished the cord.
 </p>
 <p>
 The officers of the regiment that evening were a very hungry set of men,
 for owing to some mistake the canteen wagon was among the missing, gone
 off to look after the corps train, maybe. If the men were inconvenienced
 when there was no issue of ration they scarcely ever failed to find
 something to eat in the end; they helped one another out; the men of the
 different squads "chipped in" their resources, each contributing his mite,
 while the officer, with no one to look to save himself, was in a fair way
 of starving as soon as he had not the canteen to fall back on. So there
 was a sneer on Chouteau's face, buried in the carcass of the goose, as he
 saw Captain Beaudoin go by with his prim, supercilious air, for he had
 heard that officer summoning down imprecations on the driver of the
 missing wagon; and he gave him an evil look out of the corner of his eye.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Just look at him! See, his nose twitches like a rabbit's. He would give a
 dollar for the pope's nose."
 </p>
 <p>
 They all made merry at the expense of the captain, who was too callow and
 too harsh to be a favorite with his men; they called him a <i>pete-sec</i>.
 He seemed on the point of taking the squad in hand for the scandal they
 were creating with their goose dinner, but thought better of the matter,
 ashamed, probably, to show his hunger, and walked off, holding his head
 very erect, as if he had seen nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
 As for Lieutenant Rochas, who was also conscious of a terribly empty
 sensation in his epigastric region, he put on a brave face and laughed
 good-naturedly as he passed the thrice-lucky squad. His men adored him, in
 the first place because he was at sword's points with the captain, that
 little whipper-snapper from Saint-Cyr, and also because he had once
 carried a musket like themselves. He was not always easy to get along
 with, however, and there were times when they would have given a good deal
 could they have cuffed him for his brutality.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean glanced inquiringly at his comrades, and their mute reply being
 propitious, arose and beckoned to Rochas to follow him behind the tent.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, Lieutenant, I hope you won't be offended, but if it is
 agreeable to you&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he handed him half a loaf of bread and a wooden bowl in which there
 were a second joint of the bird and six big mealy potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
 That night again the six men required no rocking; they digested their
 dinner while sleeping the sleep of the just. They had reason to thank the
 corporal for the scientific way in which he had set up their tent, for
 they were not even conscious of a small hurricane that blew up about two
 o'clock, accompanied by a sharp down-pour of rain; some of the tents were
 blown down, and the men, wakened out of their sound slumber, were drenched
 and had to scamper in the pitchy darkness, while theirs stood firm and
 they were warm and dry, thanks to the ingenious device of the trench.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice awoke at daylight, and as they were not to march until eight
 o'clock it occurred to him to walk out to the artillery camp on the hill
 and say how do you do to his cousin Honore. His foot was less painful
 after his good night's rest. His wonder and admiration were again excited
 by the neatness and perfect order that prevailed throughout the
 encampment, the six guns of a battery aligned with mathematical precision
 and accompanied by their caissons, prolonges, forage-wagons, and forges. A
 short way off, lined up to their rope, stood the horses, whinnying
 impatiently and turning their muzzles to the rising sun. He had no
 difficulty in finding Honore's tent, thanks to the regulation which
 assigns to the men of each piece a separate street, so that a single
 glance at a camp suffices to show the number of guns.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice reached his destination the artillerymen were already
 stirring and about to drink their coffee, and a quarrel had arisen between
 Adolphe, the forward driver, and Louis, the gunner, his mate. For the
 entire three years that they had been "married," in accordance with the
 custom which couples a driver with a gunner, they had lived happily
 together, with the one exception of meal-times. Louis, an intelligent man
 and the better informed of the two, did not grumble at the airs of
 superiority that are affected by every mounted over every unmounted man:
 he pitched the tent, made the soup, and did the chores, while Adolphe
 groomed his horses with the pride of a reigning potentate. When the
 former, a little black, lean man, afflicted with an enormous appetite,
 rose in arms against the exactions of the latter, a big, burly fellow with
 huge blonde mustaches, who insisted on being waited on like a lord, then
 the fun began. The subject matter of the dispute on the present morning
 was that Louis, who had made the coffee, accused Adolphe of having drunk
 it all. It required some diplomacy to reconcile them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Not a morning passed that Honore failed to go and look after his piece,
 seeing to it that it was carefully dried and cleansed from the night dew,
 as if it had been a favorite animal that he was fearful might take cold,
 and there it was that Maurice found him, exercising his paternal
 supervision in the crisp morning air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, it's you! I knew that the 106th was somewhere in the vicinity; I got
 a letter from Remilly yesterday and was intending to start out and hunt
 you up. Let's go and have a glass of white wine."
 </p>
 <p>
 For the sake of privacy he conducted his cousin to the little farmhouse
 that the soldiers had looted the day before, where the old peasant,
 undeterred by his losses and allured by the prospect of turning an honest
 penny, had tapped a cask of wine and set up a kind of public bar. He had
 extemporized a counter from a board rested on two empty barrels before the
 door of his house, and over it he dealt out his stock in trade at four
 sous a glass, assisted by the strapping young Alsatian whom he had taken
 into his service three days before.
 </p>
 <p>
 As Honore was touching glasses with Maurice his eyes lighted on this man.
 He gazed at him a moment as if stupefied, then let slip a terrible oath.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> Goliah!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he darted forward and would have caught him by the throat, but the
 peasant, foreseeing in his action a repetition of his yesterday's
 experience, jumped quickly within the house and locked the door behind
 him. For a moment confusion reigned about the premises; soldiers came
 rushing up to see what was going on, while the quartermaster-sergeant
 shouted at the top of his voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Open the door, open the door, you confounded idiot! It is a spy, I tell
 you, a Prussian spy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice doubted no longer; there was no room for mistake now; the Alsatian
 was certainly the man whom he had seen arrested at the camp of Mulhausen
 and released because there was not evidence enough to hold him, and that
 man was Goliah, old Fouchard's quondam assistant on his farm at Remilly.
 When finally the peasant opened his door the house was searched from top
 to bottom, but to no purpose; the bird had flown, the gawky Alsatian, the
 tow-headed, simple-faced lout whom General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had
 questioned the day before at dinner without learning anything and before
 whom, in the innocence of his heart, he had disclosed things that would
 have better been kept secret. It was evident enough that the scamp had
 made his escape by a back window which was found open, but the hunt that
 was immediately started throughout the village and its environs had no
 results; the fellow, big as he was, had vanished as utterly as a
 smoke-wreath dissolves upon the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice thought it best to take Honore away, lest in his distracted state
 he might reveal to the spectators unpleasant family secrets which they had
 no concern to know.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i>" he cried again, "it would have done me such
 good to strangle him!&mdash;The letter that I was speaking of revived all
 my old hatred for him."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the two of them sat down upon the ground against a stack of rye a
 little way from the house, and he handed the letter to his cousin.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the old story: the course of Honore Fouchard's and Silvine
 Morange's love had not run smooth. She, a pretty, meek-eyed, brown-haired
 girl, had in early childhood lost her mother, an operative in one of the
 factories of Raucourt, and Doctor Dalichamp, her godfather, a worthy man
 who was greatly addicted to adopting the wretched little beings whom he
 ushered into the world, had conceived the idea of placing her in Father
 Fouchard's family as small maid of all work. True it was that the old boor
 was a terrible skinflint and a harsh, stern taskmaster; he had gone into
 the butchering business from sordid love of lucre, and his cart was to be
 seen daily, rain or shine, on the roads of twenty communes; but if the
 child was willing to work she would have a home and a protector, perhaps
 some small prospect in the future. At all events she would be spared the
 contamination of the factory. And naturally enough it came to pass that in
 old Fouchard's household the son and heir and the little maid of all work
 fell in love with each other. Honore was then just turned sixteen and she
 was twelve, and when she was sixteen and he twenty there was a drawing for
 the army; Honore, to his great delight, secured a lucky number and
 determined to marry. Nothing had ever passed between them, thanks to the
 unusual delicacy that was inherent in the lad's tranquil, thoughtful
 nature, more than an occasional hug and a furtive kiss in the barn. But
 when he spoke of the marriage to his father, the old man, who had the
 stubbornness of the mule, angrily told him that his son might kill him,
 but never, never would he consent, and continued to keep the girl about
 the house, not worrying about the matter, expecting it would soon blow
 over. For two years longer the young folks kept on adoring and desiring
 each other, and never the least breath of scandal sullied their names.
 Then one day there was a frightful quarrel between the two men, after
 which the young man, feeling he could no longer endure his father's
 tyranny, enlisted and was packed off to Africa, while the butcher still
 retained the servant-maid, because she was useful to him. Soon after that
 a terrible thing happened: Silvine, who had sworn that she would be true
 to her lover and await his return, was detected one day, two short weeks
 after his departure, in the company of a laborer who had been working on
 the farm for some months past, that Goliah Steinberg, the Prussian, as he
 was called; a tall, simple young fellow with short, light hair, wearing a
 perpetual smile on his broad, pink face, who had made himself Honore's
 chum. Had Father Fouchard traitorously incited the man to take advantage
 of the girl? or had Silvine, sick at heart and prostrated by the sorrow of
 parting with her lover, yielded in a moment of unconsciousness? She could
 not tell herself; was dazed, and saw herself driven by the necessity of
 her situation to a marriage with Goliah. He, for his part, always with the
 everlasting smile on his face, made no objection, only insisted on
 deferring the ceremony until the child should be born. When that event
 occurred he suddenly disappeared; it was rumored, subsequently that he had
 found work on another farm, over Beaumont way. These things had happened
 three years before the breaking out of the war, and now everyone was
 convinced that that artless, simple Goliah, who had such a way of
 ingratiating himself with the girls, was none else than one of those
 Prussian spies who filled our eastern provinces. When Honore learned the
 tidings over in Africa he was three months in hospital, as if the fierce
 sun of that country had smitten him on the neck with one of his fiery
 javelins, and never thereafter did he apply for leave of absence to return
 to his country for fear lest he might again set eyes on Silvine and her
 child.
 </p>
 <p>
 The artilleryman's hands shook with agitation as Maurice perused the
 letter. It was from Silvine, the first, the only one that she had ever
 written him. What had been her guiding impulse, that silent, submissive
 woman, whose handsome black eyes at times manifested a startling fixedness
 of purpose in the midst of her never-ending slavery? She simply said that
 she knew he was with the army, and though she might never see him again,
 she could not endure the thought that he might die and believe that she
 had ceased to love him. She loved him still, had never loved another; and
 this she repeated again and again through four closely written pages, in
 words of unvarying import, without the slightest word of excuse for
 herself, without even attempting to explain what had happened. There was
 no mention of the child, nothing but an infinitely mournful and tender
 farewell.
 </p>
 <p>
 The letter produced a profound impression upon Maurice, to whom his cousin
 had once imparted the whole story. He raised his eyes and saw that Honore
 was weeping; he embraced him like a brother.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor Honore."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the sergeant quickly got the better of his emotion. He carefully
 restored the letter to its place over his heart and rebuttoned his jacket.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, those are things that a man does not forget. Ah! the scoundrel, if I
 could but have laid hands on him! But we shall see."
 </p>
 <p>
 The bugles were sounding the signal to prepare for breaking camp, and each
 had to hurry away to rejoin his command. The preparations for departure
 dragged, however, and the troops had to stand waiting in heavy marching
 order until nearly nine o'clock. A feeling of hesitancy seemed to have
 taken possession of their leaders; there was not the resolute alacrity of
 the first two days, when the 7th corps had accomplished forty miles in two
 marches. Strange and alarming news, moreover, had been circulating through
 the camp since morning, that the three other corps were marching
 northward, the 1st at Juniville, the 5th and 12th at Rethel, and this
 deviation from their route was accounted for on the ground of the
 necessities of the commissariat. Montmedy had ceased to be their
 objective, then? why were they thus idling away their time again? What was
 most alarming of all was that the Prussians could not now be far away, for
 the officers had cautioned their men not to fall behind the column, as all
 stragglers were liable to be picked up by the enemy's light cavalry. It
 was the 25th of August, and Maurice, when he subsequently recalled to mind
 Goliah's disappearance, was certain that the man had been instrumental in
 affording the German staff exact information as to the movements of the
 army of Chalons, and thus producing the change of front of their third
 army. The succeeding morning the Crown Prince of Prussia left Revigny and
 the great maneuver was initiated, that gigantic movement by the flank,
 surrounding and enmeshing us by a series of forced marches conducted in
 the most admirable order through Champagne and the Ardennes. While the
 French were stumbling aimlessly about the country, oscillating uncertainly
 between one place and another, the Prussians were making their twenty
 miles a day and more, gradually contracting their immense circle of
 beaters upon the band of men whom they held within their toils, and
 driving their prey onward toward the forests of the frontier.
 </p>
 <p>
 A start was finally made, and the result of the day's movement showed that
 the army was pivoting on its left; the 7th corps only traversed the two
 short leagues between Contreuve and Vouziers, while the 5th and 12th corps
 did not stir from Rethel, and the 1st went no farther than Attigny.
 Between Contreuve and the valley of the Aisne the country became level
 again and was more bare than ever; as they drew near to Vouziers the road
 wound among desolate hills and naked gray fields, without a tree, without
 a house, as gloomy and forbidding as a desert, and the day's march, short
 as it was, was accomplished with such fatigue and distress that it seemed
 interminably long. Soon after midday, however, the 1st and 3d divisions
 had passed through the city and encamped in the meadows on the farther
 bank of the Aisne, while a brigade of the second, which included the
 106th, had remained upon the left bank, bivouacking among the waste lands
 of which the low foot-hills overlooked the valley, observing from their
 position the Monthois road, which skirts the stream and by which the enemy
 was expected to make his appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice was dumfoundered to behold advancing along that Monthois road
 Margueritte's entire division, the body of cavalry to which had been
 assigned the duty of supporting the 7th corps and watching the left flank
 of the army. The report was that it was on its way to Chene-Populeux. Why
 was the left wing, where alone they were threatened by the enemy, stripped
 in that manner? What sense was there in summoning in upon the center,
 where they could be of no earthly use, those two thousand horsemen, who
 should have been dispersed upon our flank, leagues away, as videttes to
 observe the enemy? And what made matters worse was that they caused the
 greatest confusion among the columns of the 7th corps, cutting in upon
 their line of march and producing an inextricable jam of horses, guns, and
 men. A squadron of chasseurs d'Afrique were halted for near two hours at
 the gate of Vouziers, and by the merest chance Maurice stumbled on
 Prosper, who had ridden his horse down to the bank of a neighboring pond
 to let him drink, and the two men were enabled to exchange a few words.
 The chasseur appeared stunned, dazed, knew nothing and had seen nothing
 since they left Rheims; yes, though, he had: he had seen two uhlans more;
 oh! but they were will o' the wisps, phantoms, they were, that appeared
 and vanished, and no one could tell whence they came nor whither they
 went. Their fame had spread, and stories of them were already rife
 throughout the country, such, for instance, as that of four uhlans
 galloping into a town with drawn revolvers and taking possession of it,
 when the corps to which they belonged was a dozen miles away. They were
 everywhere, preceding the columns like a buzzing, stinging swarm of bees,
 a living curtain, behind which the infantry could mask their movements and
 march and countermarch as securely as if they were at home upon parade.
 And Maurice's heart sank in his bosom as he looked at the road, crowded
 with chasseurs and hussars which our leaders put to such poor use.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, then, <i>au revoir</i>," said he, shaking Prosper by the hand;
 "perhaps they will find something for you to do down yonder, after all."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the chasseur appeared disgusted with the task assigned him. He sadly
 stroked Poulet's neck and answered:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, what's the use talking! they kill our horses and let us rot in
 idleness. It is sickening."
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice took off his shoe that evening to have a look at his foot,
 which was aching and throbbing feverishly, the skin came with it; the
 blood spurted forth and he uttered a cry of pain. Jean was standing by,
 and exhibited much pity and concern.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look here, that is becoming serious; you are going to lie right down and
 not attempt to move. That foot of yours must be attended to. Let me see
 it."
 </p>
 <p>
 He knelt down, washed the sore with his own hands and bound it up with
 some clean linen that he took from his knapsack. He displayed the
 gentleness of a woman and the deftness of a surgeon, whose big fingers can
 be so pliant when necessity requires it.
 </p>
 <p>
 A great wave of tenderness swept over Maurice, his eyes were dimmed with
 tears, the familiar <i>thou</i> rose from his heart to his lips with an
 irresistible impulse of affection, as if in that peasant whom he once had
 hated and abhorred, whom only yesterday he had despised, he had discovered
 a long lost brother.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thou art a good fellow, thou! Thanks, good friend."
 </p>
 <p>
 And Jean, too, looking very happy, dropped into the second person
 singular, with his tranquil smile.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Now, my little one, wilt thou have a cigarette? I have some tobacco
 left."

 <h2>
 V.
 </h2>
 <p>
 On the morning of the following day, the 26th, Maurice arose with
 stiffened limbs and an aching back, the result of his night under the
 tent. He was not accustomed yet to sleeping on the bare ground; orders had
 been given before the men turned in that they were not to remove their
 shoes, and during the night the sergeants had gone the rounds, feeling in
 the darkness to see if all were properly shod and gaitered, so that his
 foot was much inflamed and very painful. In addition to his other troubles
 he had imprudently stretched his legs outside the canvas to relieve their
 cramped feeling and taken cold in them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean said as soon as he set eyes on him:
 </p>
 <p>
 "If we are to do any marching to-day, my lad, you had better see the
 surgeon and get him to give you a place in one of the wagons."
 </p>
 <p>
 But no one seemed to know what were the plans for the day, and the most
 conflicting reports prevailed. It appeared for a moment as if they were
 about to resume their march; the tents were struck and the entire corps
 took the road and passed through Vouziers, leaving on the right bank of
 the Aisne only one brigade of the second division, apparently to continue
 the observation of the Monthois road; but all at once, as soon as they had
 put the town behind them and were on the left bank of the stream, they
 halted and stacked muskets in the fields and meadows that skirt the
 Grand-Pre road on either hand, and the departure of the 4th hussars, who
 just then moved off on that road at a sharp trot, afforded fresh food for
 conjecture.
 </p>
 <p>
 "If we are to remain here I shall stay with you," declared Maurice, who
 was not attracted by the prospect of riding in an ambulance.
 </p>
 <p>
 It soon became known that they were to occupy their present camp until
 General Douay could obtain definite information as to the movements of the
 enemy. The general had been harassed by an intense and constantly
 increasing anxiety since the day before, when he had seen Margueritte's
 division moving toward Chene, for he knew that his flank was uncovered,
 that there was not a man to watch the passes of the Argonne, and that he
 was liable to be attacked at any moment. Therefore he had sent out the 4th
 hussars to reconnoiter the country as far as the defiles of Grand-Pre and
 Croix-aux-Bois, with strict orders not to return without intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
 There had been an issue of bread, meat, and forage the day before, thanks
 to the efficient mayor of Vouziers, and about ten o'clock that morning
 permission had been granted the men to make soup, in the fear that they
 might not soon again have so good an opportunity, when another movement of
 troops, the departure of Bordas' brigade over the road taken by the
 hussars, set all tongues wagging afresh. What! were they going to march
 again? were they not to be given a chance to eat their breakfast in peace,
 now that the kettle was on the fire? But the officers explained that
 Bordas' brigade had only been sent to occupy Buzancy, a few kilometers
 from there. There were others, indeed, who asserted that the hussars had
 encountered a strong force of the enemy's cavalry and that the brigade had
 been dispatched to help them out of their difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice enjoyed a few hours of delicious repose. He had thrown himself on
 the ground in a field half way up the hill where the regiment had halted,
 and in a drowsy state between sleeping and waking was contemplating the
 verdant valley of the Aisne, the smiling meadows dotted with clumps of
 trees, among which the little stream wound lazily. Before him and closing
 the valley in that direction lay Vouziers, an amphitheater of roofs rising
 one above another and overtopped by the church with its slender spire and
 dome-crowned tower. Below him, near the bridge, smoke was curling upward
 from the tall chimneys of the tanneries, while farther away a great mill
 displayed its flour-whitened buildings among the fresh verdure of the
 growths that lined the waterside. The little town that lay there, bounding
 his horizon, hidden among the stately trees, appeared to him to possess a
 gentle charm; it brought him memories of boyhood, of the journeys that he
 had made to Vouziers in other days, when he had lived at Chene, the
 village where he was born. For an hour he was oblivious of the outer
 world.
 </p>
 <p>
 The soup had long since been made and eaten and everyone was waiting to
 see what would happen next, when, about half-past two o'clock, the
 smoldering excitement began to gain strength, and soon pervaded the entire
 camp. Hurried orders came to abandon the meadows, and the troops ascended
 a line of hills between two villages, Chestres and Falaise, some two or
 three miles apart, and took position there. Already the engineers were at
 work digging rifle-pits and throwing up epaulments; while over to the left
 the artillery had occupied the summit of a rounded eminence. The rumor
 spread that General Bordas had sent in a courier to announce that he had
 encountered the enemy in force at Grand-Pre and had been compelled to fall
 back on Buzancy, which gave cause to apprehend that he might soon be cut
 off from retreat on Vouziers. For these reasons, the commander of the 7th
 corps, believing an attack to be imminent, had placed his men in position
 to sustain the first onset until the remainder of the army should have
 time to come to his assistance, and had started off one of his
 aides-de-camp with a letter to the marshal, apprising him of the danger,
 and asking him for re-enforcements. Fearing for the safety of the
 subsistence train, which had come up with the corps during the night and
 was again dragging its interminable length in the rear, he summarily sent
 it to the right about and directed it to make the best of its way to
 Chagny. Things were beginning to look like fight.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So, it looks like business this time&mdash;eh, Lieutenant?" Maurice
 ventured to ask Rochas.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, thank goodness," replied the Lieutenant, his long arms going like
 windmills. "Wait a little; you'll find it warm enough!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The soldiers were all delighted; the animation in the camp was still more
 pronounced. A feverish impatience had taken possession of the men, now
 that they were actually in line of battle between Chestres and Falaise. At
 last they were to have a sight of those Prussians who, if the newspapers
 were to be believed, were knocked up by their long marches, decimated by
 sickness, starving, and in rags, and every man's heart beat high with the
 prospect of annihilating them at a single blow.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are lucky to come across them again," said Jean. "They've been playing
 hide-and-seek about long enough since they slipped through our fingers
 after their battle down yonder on the frontier. But are these the same
 troops that whipped MacMahon, I wonder?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice could not answer his question with any degree of certainty. It
 seemed to him hardly probable, in view of what he had read in the
 newspapers at Rheims, that the third army, commanded by the Crown Prince
 of Prussia, could be at Vouziers, when, only two days before, it was just
 on the point of going into camp at Vitry-le-Francois. There had been some
 talk of a fourth army, under the Prince of Saxony, which was to operate on
 the line of the Meuse; this was doubtless the one that was now before
 them, although their promptitude in occupying Grand-Pre was a matter of
 surprise, considering the distances. But what put the finishing touch to
 the confusion of his ideas was his stupefaction to hear General
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles ask a countryman if the Meuse did not flow past
 Buzancy, and if the bridges there were strong. The general announced,
 moreover, in the confidence of his sublime ignorance, that a column of one
 hundred thousand men was on the way from Grand-Pre to attack them, while
 another, of sixty thousand, was coming up by the way of Sainte-Menehould.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How's your foot, Maurice?" asked Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It don't hurt now," the other laughingly replied. "If there is to be a
 fight, I think it will be quite well."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true; his nervous excitement was so great that he was hardly
 conscious of the ground on which he trod. To think that in the whole
 campaign he had not yet burned powder! He had gone forth to the frontier,
 he had endured the agony of that terrible night of expectation before
 Mulhausen, and had not seen a Prussian, had not fired a shot; then he had
 retreated with the rest to Belfort, to Rheims, had now been marching five
 days trying to find the enemy, and his useless <i>chassepot</i> was as
 clean as the day it left the shop, without the least smell of smoke on it.
 He felt an aching desire to discharge his piece once, if no more, to
 relieve the tension of his nerves. Since the day, near six weeks ago, when
 he had enlisted in a fit of enthusiasm, supposing that he would surely
 have to face the foe in a day or two, all that he had done had been to
 tramp up and down the country on his poor, sore feet&mdash;the feet of a
 man who had lived in luxury, far from the battle-field; and so, among all
 those impatient watchers, there was none who watched more impatiently than
 he the Grand-Pre road, extending straight away to a seemingly infinite
 distance between two rows of handsome trees. Beneath him was unrolled the
 panorama of the valley; the Aisne was, like a silver ribbon, flowing
 between its willows and poplars, and ever his gaze returned, solicited by
 an irresistible attraction, to that road down yonder that stretched away,
 far as the eye could see, to the horizon.
 </p>
 <p>
 About four o'clock the 4th hussars returned, having made a wide circuit in
 the country round about, and stories, which grew as they were repeated,
 began to circulate of conflicts with uhlans, tending to confirm the
 confident belief which everyone had that an attack was imminent. Two hours
 later a courier came galloping in, breathless with terror, to announce
 that General Bordas had positive information that the enemy were on the
 Vouziers road, and dared not leave Grand-Pre. It was evident that that
 could not be true, since the courier had just passed over the road
 unharmed, but no one could tell at what moment it might be the case, and
 General Dumont, commanding the division, set out at once with his
 remaining brigade to bring off his other brigade that was in difficulty.
 The sun went down behind Vouziers and the roofs of the town were sharply
 profiled in black against a great red cloud. For a long time the brigade
 was visible as it receded between the double row of trees, until finally
 it was swallowed up in the gathering darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
 Colonel de Vineuil came to look after his regiment's position for the
 night. He was surprised not to find Captain Beaudoin at his post, and as
 that officer just then chanced to come in from Vouziers, where he alleged
 in excuse for his absence that he had been breakfasting with the Baronne
 de Ladicourt, he received a sharp reprimand, which he digested in silence,
 with the rigid manner of a martinet conscious of being in the wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My children," said the Colonel, as he passed along the line of men, "we
 shall probably be attacked to-night, or if not, then by day-break
 to-morrow morning at the latest. Be prepared, and remember that the 106th
 has never retreated before the enemy."
 </p>
 <p>
 The little speech was received with loud hurrahs; everyone, in the
 prevailing suspense and discouragement, preferred to "take the wipe of the
 dish-clout" and have done with it. Rifles were examined to see that they
 were in good order, belts were refilled with cartridges. As they had eaten
 their soup that morning, the men were obliged to content themselves with
 biscuits and coffee. An order was promulgated that there was to be no
 sleeping. The grand-guards were out nearly a mile to the front, and a
 chain of sentinels at frequent intervals extended down to the Aisne. The
 officers were seated in little groups about the camp-fires, and beside a
 low wall at the left of the road the fitful blaze occasionally flared up
 and rescued from the darkness the gold embroideries and bedizened uniforms
 of the Commander-in-Chief and his staff, flitting to and fro like
 phantoms, watching the road and listening for the tramp of horses in the
 mortal anxiety they were in as to the fate of the third division.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was about one o'clock in the morning when it came Maurice's turn to
 take his post as sentry at the edge of an orchard of plum-trees, between
 the road and the river. The night was black as ink, and as soon as his
 comrades left him and he found himself alone in the deep silence of the
 sleeping fields he was conscious of a sensation of fear creeping over him,
 a feeling of abject terror such as he had never known before and which he
 trembled with rage and shame at his inability to conquer. He turned his
 head to cheer himself by a sight of the camp-fires, but they were hidden
 from him by a wood; there was naught behind him but an unfathomable sea of
 blackness; all that he could discern was a few distant lights still dimly
 burning in Vouziers, where the inhabitants, doubtless forewarned and
 trembling at the thought of the impending combat, were keeping anxious
 vigil. His terror was increased, if that were possible, on bringing his
 piece to his shoulder to find that he could not even distinguish the
 sights on it. Then commenced a period of suspense that tried his nerves
 most cruelly; every faculty of his being was strained and concentrated in
 the one sense of hearing; sounds so faint as to be imperceptible
 reverberated in his ears like the crash of thunder; the plash of a distant
 waterfall, the rustling of a leaf, the movement of an insect in the grass,
 were like the booming of artillery. Was that the tramp of cavalry, the
 deep rumbling of gun-carriages driven at speed, that he heard down there
 to the right? And there on his left, what was that? was it not the sound
 of stealthy whispers, stifled voices, a party creeping up to surprise him
 under cover of the darkness? Three times he was on the point of giving the
 alarm by firing his piece. The fear that he might be mistaken and incur
 the ridicule of his comrades served to intensify his distress. He had
 kneeled upon the ground, supporting his left shoulder against a tree; it
 seemed to him that he had been occupying that position for hours, that
 they had forgotten him there, that the army had moved away without him.
 Then suddenly, at once, his fear left him; upon the road, that he knew was
 not two hundred yards away, he distinctly heard the cadenced tramp of
 marching men. Immediately it flashed across his mind as a certainty that
 they were the troops from Grand-Pre, whose coming had been awaited with
 such anxiety&mdash;General Dumont bringing in Bordas' brigade. At that
 same moment the corporal of the guard came along with the relief; he had
 been on post a little less than the customary hour.
 </p>
 <p>
 He had been right; it was the 3d division returning to camp. Everyone felt
 a sensation of deep relief. Increased precautions were taken,
 nevertheless, for what fresh intelligence they received tended to confirm
 what they supposed they already knew of the enemy's approach. A few
 uhlans, forbidding looking fellows in their long black cloaks, were
 brought in as prisoners, but they were uncommunicative, and so daylight
 came at last, the pale, ghastly light of a rainy morning, bringing with it
 no alleviation of their terrible suspense. No one had dared to close an
 eye during that long night. About seven o'clock Lieutenant Rochas affirmed
 that MacMahon was coming up with the whole army. The truth of the matter
 was that General Douay, in reply to his dispatch of the preceding day
 announcing that a battle at Vouziers was inevitable, had received a letter
 from the marshal enjoining him to hold the position until re-enforcements
 could reach him; the forward movement had been arrested; the 1st corps was
 being directed on Terron, the 5th on Buzancy, while the 12th was to remain
 at Chene and constitute our second line. Then the suspense became more
 breathless still; it was to be no mere skirmish that the peaceful valley
 of the Aisne was to witness that day, but a great battle, in which would
 participate the entire army, that was even now turning its back upon the
 Meuse and marching southward; and there was no making of soup, the men had
 to content themselves with coffee and hard-tack, for everyone was saying,
 without troubling himself to ask why, that the "wipe of the dish-clout"
 was set down for midday. An aide-de-camp had been dispatched to the
 marshal to urge him to hurry forward their supports, as intelligence
 received from every quarter made it more and more certain that the two
 Prussian armies were close at hand, and three hours later still another
 officer galloped off like mad toward Chene, where general headquarters
 were located, with a request for instructions, for consternation had risen
 to a higher pitch then ever with the receipt of fresh tidings from the <i>maire</i>
 of a country commune, who told of having seen a hundred thousand men at
 Grand-Pre, while another hundred thousand were advancing by way of
 Buzancy.
 </p>
 <p>
 Midday came, and not a sign of the Prussians. At one o'clock, at two, it
 was the same, and a reaction of lassitude and doubt began to prevail among
 the troops. Derisive jeers were heard at the expense of the generals:
 perhaps they had seen their shadow on the wall; they should be presented
 with a pair of spectacles. A pretty set of humbugs they were, to have
 caused all that trouble for nothing! A fellow who passed for a wit among
 his comrades shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is like it was down there at Mulhausen, eh?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The words recalled to Maurice's mind a flood of bitter memories. He
 thought of that idiotic flight, that panic that had swept away the 7th
 corps when there was not a German visible, nor within ten leagues of where
 they were, and now he had a distinct certainty that they were to have a
 renewal of that experience. It was plain that if twenty-four hours had
 elapsed since the skirmish at Grand-Pre and they had not been attacked,
 the reason was that the 4th hussars had merely struck up against a
 reconnoitering body of cavalry; the main body of the Prussians must be far
 away, probably a day's march or two. Then the thought suddenly struck him
 of the time they had wasted, and it terrified him; in three days they had
 only accomplished the distance from Contreuve to Vouziers, a scant two
 leagues. On the 25th the other corps, alleging scarcity of supplies, had
 diverted their course to the north, while now, on the 27th, here they were
 coming southward again to fight a battle with an invisible enemy. Bordas'
 brigade had followed the 4th hussars into the abandoned passes of the
 Argonne, and was supposed to have got itself into trouble; the division
 had gone to its assistance, and that had been succeeded by the corps, and
 that by the entire army, and all those movements had amounted to nothing.
 Maurice trembled as he reflected how pricelessly valuable was every hour,
 every minute, in that mad project of joining forces with Bazaine, a
 project that could be carried to a successful issue only by an officer of
 genius, with seasoned troops under him, who should press forward to his
 end with the resistless energy of a whirlwind, crushing every obstacle
 that lay in his path.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is all up with us!" said he, as the whole truth flashed through his
 mind, to Jean, who had given way to despair. Then as the corporal, failing
 to catch his meaning, looked at him wonderingly, he went on in an
 undertone, for his friend's ear alone, to speak of their commanders:
 </p>
 <p>
 "They mean well, but they have no sense, that's certain&mdash;and no luck!
 They know nothing; they foresee nothing; they have neither plans nor
 ideas, nor happy intuitions. <i>Allons</i>! everything is against us; it
 is all up!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And by slow degrees that same feeling of discouragement that Maurice had
 arrived at by a process of reasoning settled down upon the denser
 intellects of the troops who lay there inactive, anxiously awaiting to see
 what the end would be. Distrust, as a result of their truer perception of
 the position they were in, was obscurely burrowing in those darkened
 minds, and there was no man so ignorant as not to feel a sense of injury
 at the ignorance and irresolution of their leaders, although he might not
 have been able to express in distinct terms the causes of his
 exasperation. In the name of Heaven, what were they doing there, since the
 Prussians had not shown themselves? either let them fight and have it over
 with, or else go off to some place where they could get some sleep; they
 had had enough of that kind of work. Since the departure of the second
 aide-de-camp, who had been dispatched in quest of orders, this feeling of
 unrest had been increasing momentarily; men collected in groups, talking
 loudly and discussing the situation pro and con, and the general
 inquietude communicating itself to the officers, they knew not what answer
 to make to those of their men who ventured to question them. They ought to
 be marching, it would not answer to dawdle thus; and so, when it became
 known about five o'clock that the aide-de-camp had returned and that they
 were to retreat, there was a sigh of relief throughout the camp and every
 heart was lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
 It seemed that the wiser counsel was to prevail, then, after all! The
 Emperor and MacMahon had never looked with favor on the movement toward
 Montmedy, and now, alarmed to learn that they were again out-marched and
 out-maneuvered, and that they were to have the army of the Prince of
 Saxony as well as that of the Crown Prince to contend with, they had
 renounced the hazardous scheme of uniting their forces with Bazaine, and
 would retreat through the northern strongholds with a view to falling back
 ultimately on Paris. The 7th corps' destination would be Chagny, by way of
 Chene, while the 5th corps would be directed on Poix, and the 1st and 12th
 on Vendresse. But why, since they were about to fall back, had they
 advanced to the line of the Aisne? Why all that waste of time and labor,
 when it would have been so easy and so rational to move straight from
 Rheims and occupy the strong positions in the valley of the Marne? Was
 there no guiding mind, no military talent, no common sense? But there
 should be no more questioning; all should be forgiven, in the universal
 joy at the adoption of that eminently wise counsel, which was the only
 means at their command of extricating themselves from the hornets' nest
 into which they had rushed so imprudently. All, officers and men, felt
 that they would be the stronger for the retrograde movement, that under
 the walls of Paris they would be invincible, and that there it was that
 the Prussians would sustain their inevitable defeat. But Vouziers must be
 evacuated before daybreak, and they must be well on the road to Chene
 before the enemy should learn of the movement, and forthwith the camp
 presented a scene of the greatest animation: trumpets sounding, officers
 hastening to and fro with orders, while the baggage and quartermaster's
 trains, in order not to encumber the rear-guard, were sent forward in
 advance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was delighted. As he was endeavoring to explain to Jean the
 rationale of the impending movement, however, a cry of pain escaped him;
 his excitement had subsided, and he was again conscious of his foot,
 aching and burning as if it had been a ball of red-hot metal.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What's the matter? is it hurting you again?" the corporal asked
 sympathizingly. And with his calm and sensible resourcefulness he said:
 "See here, little one, you told me yesterday that you have acquaintances
 in the town, yonder. You ought to get permission from the major and find
 some one to drive you over to Chene, where you could have a good night's
 rest in a comfortable bed. We can pick you up as we go by to-morrow if you
 are fit to march. What do you say to that, <i>hein</i>?"
 </p>
 <p>
 In Falaise, the village near which the camp was pitched, Maurice had come
 across a small farmer, an old friend of his father's, who was about to
 drive his daughter over to Chene to visit an aunt in that town, and the
 horse was even then standing waiting, hitched to a light carriole. The
 prospect was far from encouraging, however, when he broached the subject
 to Major Bouroche.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I have a sore foot, monsieur the doctor&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche, with a savage shake of his big head with its leonine mane,
 turned on him with a roar:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am not monsieur the doctor; who taught you manners?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And when Maurice, taken all aback, made a stammering attempt to excuse
 himself, he continued:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Address me as major, do you hear, you great oaf!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He must have seen that he had not one of the common herd to deal with and
 felt a little ashamed of himself; he carried it off with a display of more
 roughness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "All a cock-and-bull story, that sore foot of yours!&mdash;Yes, yes; you
 may go. Go in a carriage, go in a balloon, if you choose. We have too many
 of you malingerers in the army!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean assisted Maurice into the carriole the latter turned to thank
 him, whereon the two men fell into each other's arms and embraced as if
 they were never to meet again. Who could tell, amid the confusion and
 disorder of the retreat, with those bloody Prussians on their track?
 Maurice could not tell how it was that there was already such a tender
 affection between him and the young man, and twice he turned to wave him a
 farewell. As he left the camp they were preparing to light great fires in
 order to mislead the enemy when they should steal away, in deepest
 silence, before the dawn of day.
 </p>
 <p>
 As they jogged along the farmer bewailed the terrible times through which
 they were passing. He had lacked the courage to remain at Falaise, and
 already was regretting that he had left it, declaring that if the
 Prussians burned his house it would ruin him. His daughter, a tall, pale
 young woman, wept copiously. But Maurice was like a dead man for want of
 sleep, and had no ears for the farmer's lamentations; he slumbered
 peacefully, soothed by the easy motion of the vehicle, which the little
 horse trundled over the ground at such a good round pace that it took them
 less than an hour and a half to accomplish the four leagues between
 Vouziers and Chene. It was not quite seven o'clock and scarcely beginning
 to be dark when the young man rubbed his eyes and alighted in a rather
 dazed condition on the public square, near the bridge over the canal, in
 front of the modest house where he was born and had passed twenty years of
 his life. He got down there in obedience to an involuntary impulse,
 although the house had been sold eighteen months before to a veterinary
 surgeon, and in reply to the farmer's questions said that he knew quite
 well where he was going, adding that he was a thousand times obliged to
 him for his kindness.
 </p>
 <p>
 He continued to stand stock-still, however, beside the well in the middle
 of the little triangular <i>place</i>; he was as if stunned; his memory
 was a blank. Where had he intended to go? and suddenly his wits returned
 to him and he remembered that it was to the notary's, whose house was next
 door to his father's, and whose mother, Madame Desvallieres, an aged and
 most excellent lady, had petted him when he was an urchin on account of
 their being neighbors. But he hardly recognized Chene in the midst of the
 hurly-burly and confusion into which the little town, ordinarily so dead,
 was thrown by the presence of an army corps encamped at its gates and
 filling its quiet streets with officers, couriers, soldiers, and
 camp-followers and stragglers of every description. The canal was there as
 of old, passing through the town from end to end and bisecting the
 market-place in the center into two equal-sized triangles connected by a
 narrow stone bridge; and there, on the other bank, was the old market with
 its moss-grown roofs, and the Rue Berond leading away to the left and the
 Sedan road to the right, but filling the Rue de Vouziers in front of him
 and extending as far as the Hotel de Ville was such a compact, swarming,
 buzzing crowd that he was obliged to raise his eyes and take a look over
 the roof of the notary's house at the slate-covered bell tower in order to
 assure himself that that was the quiet spot where he had played hop-scotch
 when he was a youngster. There seemed to be an effort making to clear the
 square; some men were roughly crowding back the throng of idlers and
 gazers, and looking more closely he was surprised to see, parked like the
 guns of a battery, a collection of vans, baggage-wagons, and carriages
 open and closed; a miscellaneous assortment of traps that he had certainly
 set eyes on before.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was daylight still; the sun had just sunk in the canal at the point
 where it vanished in the horizon and the long, straight stretch of water
 was like a sea of blood, and Maurice was trying to make up his mind what
 to do when a woman who stood near stared at him a moment and then
 exclaimed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why goodness gracious, is it possible! Are you the Levasseur boy?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And thereon he recognized Madame Combette, the wife of the druggist, whose
 shop was on the market-place. As he was trying to explain to her that he
 was going to ask good Madame Desvallieres to give him a bed for the night
 she excitedly hurried him away.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; come to our house. I will tell you why&mdash;" When they were in
 the shop and she had cautiously closed the door she continued: "You could
 not know, my dear boy, that the Emperor is at the Desvallieres. His
 officers took possession of the house in his name and the family are not
 any too well pleased with the great honor done them, I can tell you. To
 think that the poor old mother, a woman more than seventy, was compelled
 to give up her room and go up and occupy a servant's bed in the garret!
 Look, there, on the place. All that you see there is the Emperor's; those
 are his trunks, don't you see!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And then Maurice remembered; they were the imperial carriages and
 baggage-wagons, the entire magnificent train that he had seen at Rheims.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! my dear boy, if you could but have seen the stuff they took from
 them, the silver plate, and the bottles of wine, and the baskets of good
 things, and the beautiful linen, and everything! I can't help wondering
 where they find room for such heaps of things, for the house is not a
 large one. Look, look! see what a fire they have lighted in the kitchen!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He looked over at the small white, two-storied house that stood at the
 corner of the market-place and the Rue de Vouziers, a comfortable,
 unassuming house of bourgeois aspect; how well he remembered it, inside
 and out, with its central hall and four rooms on each floor; why, it was
 as if he had just left it! There were lights in the corner room on the
 first floor overlooking the square; the apothecary's wife informed him
 that it was the bedroom of the Emperor. But the chief center of activity
 seemed, as she had said, to be the kitchen, the window of which opened on
 the Rue de Vouziers. In all their lives the good people of Chene had
 witnessed no such spectacle, and the street before the house was filled
 with a gaping crowd, constantly coming and going, who stared with all
 their eyes at the range on which was cooking the dinner of an Emperor. To
 obtain a breath of air the cooks had thrown open the window to its full
 extent. They were three in number, in jackets of resplendent whiteness,
 superintending the roasting of chickens impaled on a huge spit, stirring
 the gravies and sauces in copper vessels that shone like gold. And the
 oldest inhabitant, evoking in memory all the civic banquets that he had
 beheld at the Silver Lion, could truthfully declare that never at any one
 time had he seen so much wood burning and so much food cooking.
 </p>
 <p>
 Combette, a bustling, wizened little man, came in from the street in a
 great state of excitement from all that he had seen and heard. His
 position as deputy-mayor gave him facilities for knowing what was going
 on. It was about half-past three o'clock when MacMahon had telegraphed
 Bazaine that the Crown Prince of Prussia was approaching Chalons, thus
 necessitating the withdrawal of the army to the places along the Belgian
 frontier, and further dispatches were also in preparation for the Minister
 of War, advising him of the projected movement and explaining the terrible
 dangers of their position. It was uncertain whether or not the dispatch
 for Bazaine would get through, for communication with Metz had seemed to
 be interrupted for the past few days, but the second dispatch was another
 and more serious matter; and lowering his voice almost to a whisper the
 apothecary repeated the words that he had heard uttered by an officer of
 rank: "If they get wind of this in Paris, our goose is cooked!" Everyone
 was aware of the unrelenting persistency with which the Empress and the
 Council of Ministers urged the advance of the army. Moreover, the
 confusion went on increasing from hour to hour, the most conflicting
 advices were continually coming in as to the whereabouts of the German
 forces. Could it be possible that the Crown Prince was at Chalons? What,
 then, were the troops that the 7th corps had encountered among the passes
 of the Argonne?
 </p>
 <p>
 "They have no information at staff headquarters," continued the little
 druggist, raising his arms above his head with a despairing gesture. "Ah,
 what a mess we are in! But all will be well if the army retreats
 to-morrow." Then, dropping public for private matters, the kind-hearted
 man said: "Look here, my young friend, I am going to see what I can do for
 that foot of yours; then we'll give you some dinner and put you to bed in
 my apprentice's little room, who has cleared out."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice was tormented by such an itching desire for further
 intelligence that he could neither eat nor sleep until he had carried into
 execution his original design of paying a visit to his old friend, Madame
 Desvallieres, over the way. He was surprised that he was not halted at the
 door, which, in the universal confusion, had been left wide open, without
 so much as a sentry to guard it. People were going out and coming in
 incessantly, military men and officers of the household, and the roar from
 the blazing kitchen seemed to rise and pervade the whole house. There was
 no light in the passage and on the staircase, however, and he had to grope
 his way up as best he might. On reaching the first floor he paused for a
 few seconds, his heart beating violently, before the door of the apartment
 that he knew contained the Emperor, but not a sound was to be heard in the
 room; the stillness that reigned there was as of death. Mounting the last
 flight he presented himself at the door of the servant's room to which
 Madame Desvallieres had been consigned; the old lady was at first
 terrified at sight of him. When she recognized him presently she said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my poor child, what a sad meeting is this! I would cheerfully have
 surrendered my house to the Emperor, but the people he has about him have
 no sense of decency. They lay hands on everything, without so much as
 saying, 'By your leave,' and I am afraid they will burn the house down
 with their great fires! He, poor man, looks like a corpse, and such
 sadness in his face&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And when the young man took leave of her with a few murmured words of
 comfort she went with him to the door, and leaning over the banister:
 "Look!" she softly said, "you can see him from where you are. Ah! we are
 all undone. Adieu, my child!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice remained planted like a statue on one of the steps of the dark
 staircase. Craning his neck and directing his glance through the glazed
 fanlight over the door of the apartment, he beheld a sight that was never
 to fade from his memory.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the bare and cheerless room, the conventional bourgeois "parlor," was
 the Emperor, seated at a table on which his plate was laid, lighted at
 either end by wax candles in great silver candelabra. Silent in the
 background stood two aides-de-camp with folded arms. The wine in the glass
 was untasted, the bread untouched, a breast of chicken was cooling on the
 plate. The Emperor did not stir; he sat staring down at the cloth with
 those dim, lusterless, watery eyes that the young man remembered to have
 seen before at Rheims; but he appeared more weary than then, and when,
 evidently at the cost of a great effort, he had raised a couple of
 mouthfuls to his lips, he impatiently pushed the remainder of the food
 from him with his hand. That was his dinner. His pale face was blanched
 with an expression of suffering endured in silence.
 </p>
 <p>
 As Maurice was passing the dining room on the floor beneath, the door was
 suddenly thrown open, and through the glow of candles and the steam of
 smoking joints he caught a glimpse of a table of equerries, chamberlains,
 and aides-de-camp, engaged in devouring the Emperor's game and poultry and
 drinking his champagne, amid a great hubbub of conversation. Now that the
 marshal's dispatch had been sent off, all these people were delighted to
 know that the retreat was assured. In a week they would be at Paris and
 could sleep between clean sheets.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, for the first time, Maurice suddenly became conscious of the
 terrible fatigue that was oppressing him like a physical burden; there was
 no longer room for doubt, the whole army was about to fall back, and the
 best thing for him to do was to get some sleep while waiting for the 7th
 corps to pass. He made his way back across the square to the house of his
 friend Combette, where, like one in a dream, he ate some dinner, after
 which he was mistily conscious of someone dressing his foot and then
 conducting him upstairs to a bedroom. And then all was blackness and utter
 annihilation; he slept a dreamless, unstirring sleep. But after an
 uncertain length of time&mdash;hours, days, centuries, he knew not&mdash;he
 gave a start and sat bolt upright in bed in the surrounding darkness.
 Where was he? What was that continuous rolling sound, like the rattling of
 thunder, that had aroused him from his slumber? His recollection suddenly
 returned to him; he ran to the window to see what was going on. In the
 obscurity of the street beneath, where the night was usually so peaceful,
 the artillery was passing, horses, men, and guns, in interminable array,
 with a roar and clatter that made the lifeless houses quake and tremble.
 The abrupt vision filled him with unreasoning alarm. What time might it
 be? The great bell in the Hotel de Ville struck four. He was endeavoring
 to allay his uneasiness by assuring himself that it was simply the initial
 movement in the retreat that had been ordered the day previous, when,
 raising his eyes, he beheld a sight that gave him fresh cause for
 inquietude: there was a light still in the corner window of the notary's
 house opposite, and the shadow of the Emperor, drawn in dark profile on
 the curtain, appeared and disappeared at regularly spaced intervals.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice hastily slipped on his trousers preparatory to going down to the
 street, but just then Combette appeared at the door with a bed-candle in
 his hand, gesticulating wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I saw you from the square as I was coming home from the <i>Mairie</i>,
 and I came up to tell you the news. They have been keeping me out of my
 bed all this time; would you believe it, for more than two hours the mayor
 and I have been busy attending to fresh requisitions. Yes, everything is
 upset again; there has been another change of plans. Ah! he knew what he
 was about, that officer did, who wanted to keep the folks in Paris from
 getting wind of matters!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He went on for a long time in broken, disjointed phrases, and when he had
 finished the young man, speechless, brokenhearted, saw it all. About
 midnight the Emperor had received a dispatch from the Minister of War in
 reply to the one that had been sent by the marshal. Its exact terms were
 not known, but an aide-de-camp at the Hotel de Ville had stated openly
 that the Empress and the Council declared there would be a revolution in
 Paris should the Emperor retrace his steps and abandon Bazaine. The
 dispatch, which evinced the utmost ignorance as to the position of the
 German armies and the resources of the army of Chalons, advised, or rather
 ordered, an immediate forward movement, regardless of all considerations,
 in spite of everything, with a heat and fury that seemed incredible.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The Emperor sent for the marshal," added the apothecary, "and they were
 closeted together for near an hour; of course I am not in position to say
 what passed between them, but I am told by all the officers that there is
 to be no more retreating, and the advance to the Meuse is to be resumed at
 once. We have been requisitioning all the ovens in the city for the 1st
 corps, which will come up to-morrow morning and take the place of the
 12th, whose artillery you see at this moment starting for la Besace. The
 matter is decided for good this time; you will smell powder before you are
 much older."
 </p>
 <p>
 He ceased. He also was gazing at the lighted window over in the notary's
 house. Then he went on in a low voice, as if talking to himself, with an
 expression on his face of reflective curiosity:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I wonder what they had to say to each other? It strikes one as a rather
 peculiar proceeding, all the same, to run away from a threatened danger at
 six in the evening, and at midnight, when nothing has occurred to alter
 the situation, to rush headlong into the very self-same danger."
 </p>
 <p>
 Below them in the street Maurice still heard the gun-carriages rumbling
 and rattling over the stones of the little sleeping city, that ceaseless
 tramp of horse and man, that uninterrupted tide of humanity, pouring
 onward toward the Meuse, toward the unknown, terrible fate that the morrow
 had in store for them. And still upon the mean, cheap curtains of that
 bourgeois dwelling he beheld the shadow of the Emperor passing and
 repassing at regular intervals, the restless activity of the sick man, to
 whom his cares made sleep impossible, whose sole repose was motion, in
 whose ears was ever ringing that tramp of horses and men whom he was
 suffering to be sent forward to their death. A few brief hours, then, had
 sufficed; the slaughter was decided on; it was to be. What, indeed, could
 they have found to say to each other, that Emperor and that marshal,
 conscious, both of them, of the inevitable disaster that lay before them?
 Assured as they were at night of defeat, from their knowledge of the
 wretched condition the army would be in when the time should come for it
 to meet the enemy, how, knowing as they did that the peril was hourly
 becoming greater, could they have changed their mind in the morning?
 Certain it was that General de Palikao's plan of a swift, bold dash on
 Montmedy, which seemed hazardous on the 23d and was, perhaps, still not
 impracticable on the 25th, if conducted with veteran troops and a leader
 of ability, would on the 27th be an act of sheer madness amid the divided
 counsels of the chiefs and the increasing demoralization of the troops.
 This they both well knew; why, then, did they obey those merciless drivers
 who were flogging them onward in their irresolution? why did they hearken
 to those furious passions that were spurring them forward? The marshal's,
 it might be said, was the temperament of the soldier, whose duty is
 limited to obedience to his instructions, great in its abnegation; while
 the Emperor, who had ceased entirely to issue orders, was waiting on
 destiny. They were called on to surrender their lives and the life of the
 army; they surrendered them. It was the accomplishment of a crime, the
 black, abominable night that witnessed the murder of a nation, for
 thenceforth the army rested in the shadow of death; a hundred thousand men
 and more were sent forward to inevitable destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
 While pursuing this train of thought Maurice was watching the shadow that
 still kept appearing and vanishing on the muslin of good Madame
 Desvallieres' curtain, as if it felt the lash of the pitiless voice that
 came to it from Paris. Had the Empress that night desired the death of the
 father in order that the son might reign? March! forward ever! with no
 look backward, through mud, through rain, to bitter death, that the final
 game of the agonizing empire may be played out, even to the last card.
 March! march! die a hero's death on the piled corpses of your people, let
 the whole world gaze in awe-struck admiration, for the honor and glory of
 your name! And doubtless the Emperor was marching to his death. Below, the
 fires in the kitchen flamed and flashed no longer; equerries,
 aides-de-camp and chamberlains were slumbering, the whole house was
 wrapped in darkness, while ever the lone shade went and came unceasingly,
 accepting with resignation the sacrifice that was to be, amid the
 deafening uproar of the 12th corps, that was defiling still through the
 black night.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice suddenly reflected that, if the advance was to be resumed, the 7th
 corps would not pass through Chene, and he beheld himself left behind,
 separated from his regiment, a deserter from his post. His foot no longer
 pained him; his friend's dressing and a few hours of complete rest had
 allayed the inflammation. Combette gave him a pair of easy shoes of his
 own that were comfortable to his feet, and as soon as he had them on he
 wanted to be off, hoping that he might yet be able to overtake the 106th
 somewhere on the road between Chene and Vouziers. The apothecary labored
 vainly to dissuade him, and had almost made up his mind to put his horse
 in the gig and drive him over in person, trusting to fortune to befriend
 him in finding the regiment, when Fernand, the apprentice, appeared,
 alleging as an excuse for his absence that he had been to see his sister.
 The youth was a tall, tallow-faced individual, who looked as if he had not
 the spirit of a mouse; the horse was quickly hitched to the carriage and
 he drove off with Maurice. It was not yet five o'clock; the rain was
 pouring in torrents from a sky of inky blackness, and the dim
 carriage-lamps faintly illuminated the road and cast little fitful gleams
 of light across the streaming fields on either side, over which came
 mysterious sounds that made them pull up from time to time in the belief
 that the army was at hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, meantime, down there before Vouziers, had not been slumbering.
 Maurice had explained to him how the retreat was to be salvation to them
 all, and he was keeping watch, holding his men together and waiting for
 the order to move, which might come at any minute. About two o'clock, in
 the intense darkness that was dotted here and there by the red glow of the
 watch-fires, a great trampling of horses resounded through the camp; it
 was the advance-guard of cavalry moving off toward Balay and Quatre-Champs
 so as to observe the roads from Boult-aux-Bois and Croix-aux-Bois; then an
 hour later the infantry and artillery also put themselves in motion,
 abandoning at last the positions of Chestre and Falaise that they had
 defended so persistently for two long days against an enemy who never
 showed himself. The sky had become overcast, the darkness was profound,
 and one by one the regiments marched out in deepest silence, an array of
 phantoms stealing away into the bosom of the night. Every heart beat
 joyfully, however, as if they were escaping from some treacherous pitfall;
 already in imagination the troops beheld themselves under the walls of
 Paris, where their revenge was awaiting them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean looked out into the thick blackness. The road was bordered with trees
 on either hand and, as far as he could see, appeared to lie between wide
 meadows. Presently the country became rougher; there was a succession of
 sharp rises and descents, and just as they were entering a village which
 he supposed to be Balay, two straggling rows of houses bordering the road,
 the dense cloud that had obscured the heavens burst in a deluge of rain.
 The men had received so many duckings within the past few days that they
 took this one without a murmur, bowing their heads and plodding patiently
 onward; but when they had left Balay behind them and were crossing a wide
 extent of level ground near Quatre-Champs a violent wind began to rise.
 Beyond Quatre-Champs, when they had fought their way upward to the wide
 plateau that extends in a dreary stretch of waste land as far as Noirval,
 the wind increased to a hurricane and the driving rain stung their faces.
 There it was that the order, proceeding from the head of the column and
 re-echoed down the line, brought the regiments one after another to a
 halt, and the entire 7th corps, thirty-odd thousand men, found itself once
 more reunited in the mud and rain of the gray dawn. What was the matter?
 Why were they halted there? An uneasy feeling was already beginning to
 pervade the ranks; it was asserted in some quarters that there had been a
 change of orders. The men had been brought to ordered arms and forbidden
 to leave the ranks or sit down. At times the wind swept over the elevated
 plateau with such violence that they had to press closely to one another
 to keep from being carried off their feet. The rain blinded them and
 trickled in ice-cold streams beneath their collars down their backs. And
 two hours passed, a period of waiting that seemed as if it would never
 end, for what purpose no one could say, in an agony of expectancy that
 chilled the hearts of all.
 </p>
 <p>
 As the daylight increased Jean made an attempt to discern where they were.
 Someone had shown him where the Chene road lay off to the northwest,
 passing over a hill beyond Quatre-Champs. Why had they turned to the right
 instead of to the left? Another object of interest to him was the general
 and his staff, who had established themselves at the Converserie, a farm
 on the edge of the plateau. There seemed to be a heated discussion going
 on; officers were going and coming and the conversation was carried on
 with much gesticulation. What could they be waiting for? nothing was
 coming that way. The plateau formed a sort of amphitheater, broad expanses
 of stubble that were commanded to the north and east by wooded heights; to
 the south were thick woods, while to the west an opening afforded a
 glimpse of the valley of the Aisne with the little white houses of
 Vouziers. Below the Converserie rose the slated steeple of Quatre-Champs
 church, looming dimly through the furious storm, which seemed as if it
 would sweep away bodily the few poor moss-grown cottages of the village.
 As Jean's glance wandered down the ascending road he became conscious of a
 doctor's gig coming up at a sharp trot along the stony road, that was now
 the bed of a rapid torrent.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Maurice, who, at a turn in the road, from the hill that lay beyond
 the valley, had finally discerned the 7th corps. For two hours he had been
 wandering about the country, thanks to the stupidity of a peasant who had
 misdirected him and the sullen ill-will of his driver, whom fear of the
 Prussians had almost deprived of his wits. As soon as he reached the
 farmhouse he leaped from the gig and had no further trouble in finding the
 regiment.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean addressed him in amazement:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, is it you? What is the meaning of this? I thought you were to wait
 until we came along."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's tone and manner told of his rage and sorrow.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes! we are no longer going in that direction; it is down yonder we
 are to go, to get ourselves knocked in the head, all of us!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well," said the other presently, with a very white face. "We will
 die together, at all events."
 </p>
 <p>
 The two men met, as they had parted, with an embrace. In the drenching
 rain that still beat down as pitilessly as ever, the humble private
 resumed his place in the ranks, while the corporal, in his streaming
 garments, never murmured as he gave him the example of what a soldier
 should be.
 </p>
 <p>
 And now the tidings became more definite and spread among the men; they
 were no longer retreating on Paris; the advance to the Meuse was again the
 order of the day. An aide-de-camp had brought to the 7th corps
 instructions from the marshal to go and encamp at Nonart; the 5th was to
 take the direction of Beauclair, where it would be the right wing of the
 army, while the 1st was to move up to Chene and relieve the 12th, then on
 the march to la Besace on the extreme left. And the reason why more than
 thirty thousand men had been kept waiting there at ordered arms, for
 nearly three hours in the midst of a blinding storm, was that General
 Douay, in the deplorable confusion incident on this new change of front,
 was alarmed for the safety of the train that had been sent forward the day
 before toward Chagny; the delay was necessary to give the several
 divisions time to close up. In the confusion of all these conflicting
 movements it was said that the 12th corps train had blocked the road at
 Chene, thus cutting off that of the 7th. On the other hand, an important
 part of the <i>materiel</i>, all the forges of the artillery, had mistaken
 their road and strayed off in the direction of Terron; they were now
 trying to find their way back by the Vouziers road, where they were
 certain to fall into the hands of the Germans. Never was there such utter
 confusion, never was anxiety so intense.
 </p>
 <p>
 A feeling of bitterest discouragement took possession of the troops. Many
 of them in their despair would have preferred to seat themselves on their
 knapsacks, in the midst of that sodden, wind-swept plain, and wait for
 death to come to them. They reviled their leaders and loaded them with
 insult: ah! famous leaders, they; brainless boobies, undoing at night what
 they had done in the morning, idling and loafing when there was no enemy
 in sight, and taking to their heels as soon as he showed his face! Each
 minute added to the demoralization that was already rife, making of that
 army a rabble, without faith or hope, without discipline, a herd that
 their chiefs were conducting to the shambles by ways of which they
 themselves were ignorant. Down in the direction of Vouziers the sound of
 musketry was heard; shots were being exchanged between the rear-guard of
 the 7th corps and the German skirmishers; and now every eye was turned
 upon the valley of the Aisne, where volumes of dense black smoke were
 whirling upward toward the sky from which the clouds had suddenly been
 swept away; they all knew it was the village of Falaise burning, fired by
 the uhlans. Every man felt his blood boil in his veins; so the Prussians
 were there at last; they had sat and waited two days for them to come up,
 and then had turned and fled. The most ignorant among the men had felt
 their cheeks tingle for very shame as, in their dull way, they recognized
 the idiocy that had prompted that enormous blunder, that imbecile delay,
 that trap into which they had walked blindfolded; the light cavalry of the
 IVth army feinting in front of Bordas' brigade and halting and
 neutralizing, one by one, the several corps of the army of Chalons, solely
 to give the Crown Prince time to hasten up with the IIId army. And now,
 thanks to the marshal's complete and astounding ignorance as to the
 identity of the troops he had before him, the junction was accomplished,
 and the 5th and 7th corps were to be roughly handled, with the constant
 menace of disaster overshadowing them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's eyes were bent on the horizon, where it was reddened with the
 flames of burning Falaise. They had one consolation, however: the train
 that had been believed to be lost came crawling along out of the Chene
 road. Without delay the 2d division put itself in motion and struck out
 across the forest for Boult-aux-Bois; the 3d took post on the heights of
 Belleville to the left in order to keep an eye to the communications,
 while the 1st remained at Quatre-Champs to wait for the coming up of the
 train and guard its countless wagons. Just then the rain began to come
 down again with increased violence, and as the 106th moved off the
 plateau, resuming the march that should have never been, toward the Meuse,
 toward the unknown, Maurice thought he beheld again his vision of the
 night: the shadow of the Emperor, incessantly appearing and vanishing, so
 sad, so pitiful a sight, on the white curtain of good old Madame
 Desvallieres. Ah! that doomed army, that army of despair, that was being
 driven forward to inevitable destruction for the salvation of a dynasty!
 March, march, onward ever, with no look behind, through mud, through rain,
 to the bitter end!

 <p>
 "Thunder!" Chouteau ejaculated the following morning when he awoke,
 chilled and with aching bones, under the tent, "I wouldn't mind having a
 bouillon with plenty of meat in it."
 </p>
 <p>
 At Boult-aux-Bois, where they were now encamped, the only ration issued to
 the men the night before had been an extremely slender one of potatoes;
 the commissariat was daily more and more distracted and disorganized by
 the everlasting marches and countermarches, never reaching the designated
 points of rendezvous in time to meet the troops. As for the herds, no one
 had the faintest idea where they might be upon the crowded roads, and
 famine was staring the army in the face.
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet stretched himself and plaintively replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>fichtre</i>, yes!&mdash;No more roast goose for us now."
 </p>
 <p>
 The squad was out of sorts and sulky. Men couldn't be expected to be
 lively on an empty stomach. And then there was the rain that poured down
 incessantly, and the mud in which they had to make their beds.
 </p>
 <p>
 Observing Pache make the sign of the cross after mumbling his morning
 prayer, Chouteau captiously growled:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ask that good God of yours, if he is good for anything, to send us down a
 couple of sausages and a mug of beer apiece."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, if we only had a good big loaf of bread!" sighed Lapoulle, whose
 ravenous appetite made hunger a more grievous affliction to him than to
 the others.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Lieutenant Rochas, passing by just then, made them be silent. It was
 scandalous, never to think of anything but their stomachs! When <i>he</i>
 was hungry he tightened up the buckle of his trousers. Now that things
 were becoming decidedly squally and the popping of rifles was to be heard
 occasionally in the distance, he had recovered all his old serene
 confidence: it was all plain enough, now; the Prussians were there&mdash;well,
 all they had to do was, go out and lick 'em. And he gave a significant
 shrug of the shoulders, standing behind Captain Beaudoin, the <i>very</i>
 young man, as he called him, with his pale face and pursed up lips, whom
 the loss of his baggage had afflicted so grievously that he had even
 ceased to fume and scold. A man might get along without eating, at a
 pinch, but that he could not change his linen was a circumstance
 productive of sorrow and anger.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice awoke to a sensation of despondency and physical discomfort.
 Thanks to his easy shoes the inflammation in his foot had gone down, but
 the drenching he had received the day before, from the effects of which
 his greatcoat seemed to weigh a ton, had left him with a distinct and
 separate ache in every bone of his body. When he was sent to the spring to
 get water for the coffee he took a survey of the plain on the edge of
 which Boult-aux-Bois is situated: forests rise to the west and north, and
 there is a hill crowned by the hamlet of Belleville, while, over to the
 east, Buzancy way, there is a broad, level expanse, stretching far as the
 eye can see, with an occasional shallow depression concealing a small
 cluster of cottages. Was it from that direction that they were to expect
 the enemy? As he was returning from the stream with his bucket filled with
 water, the father of a family of wretched peasants hailed him from the
 door of his hovel, and asked him if the soldiers were this time going to
 stay and defend them. In the confusion of conflicting orders the 5th corps
 had already traversed the region no less than three times. The sound of
 cannonading had reached them the day before from the direction of Bar; the
 Prussians could not be more than a couple of leagues away. And when
 Maurice made answer to the poor folks that doubtless the 7th corps would
 also be called away after a time, their tears flowed afresh. Then they
 were to be abandoned to the enemy, and the soldiers had not come there to
 fight, whom they saw constantly vanishing and reappearing, always on the
 run?
 </p>
 <p>
 "Those who like theirs sweet," observed Loubet, as he poured the coffee,
 "have only to stick their thumb in it and wait for it to melt."
 </p>
 <p>
 Not a man of them smiled. It was too bad, all the same, to have to drink
 their coffee without sugar; and then, too, if they only had some biscuit!
 Most of them had devoured what eatables they had in their knapsacks, to
 the very last crumb, to while away their time of waiting, the day before,
 on the plateau of Quatre-Champs. Among them, however, the members of the
 squad managed to collect a dozen potatoes, which they shared equally.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who began to feel a twinging sensation in his stomach, uttered a
 regretful cry:
 </p>
 <p>
 "If I had known of this I would have bought some bread at Chene."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean listened in silence. He had had a dispute with Chouteau that morning,
 who, on being ordered to go for firewood, had insolently refused, alleging
 that it was not his turn. Now that everything was so rapidly going to the
 dogs, insubordination among the men had increased to such a point that
 those in authority no longer ventured to reprimand them, and Jean, with
 his sober good sense and pacific disposition, saw that if he would
 preserve his influence with his squad he must keep the corporal in the
 background as far as possible. For this reason he was hail-fellow-well-met
 with his men, who could not fail to see what a treasure they had in a man
 of his experience, for if those committed to his care did not always have
 all they wanted to eat, they had, at all events, not suffered from hunger,
 as had been the case with so many others. But he was touched by the sight
 of Maurice's suffering. He saw that he was losing strength, and looked at
 him anxiously, asking himself how that delicate young man would ever
 manage to sustain the privations of that horrible campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean heard Maurice bewail the lack of bread he arose quietly, went to
 his knapsack, and, returning, slipped a biscuit into the other's hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here! don't let the others see it; I have not enough to go round."
 </p>
 <p>
 "But what will you do?" asked the young man, deeply affected.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't be alarmed about me&mdash;I have two left."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true; he had carefully put aside three biscuits, in case there
 should be a fight, knowing that men are often hungry on the battlefield.
 And then, besides, he had just eaten a potato; that would be sufficient
 for him. Perhaps something would turn up later on.
 </p>
 <p>
 About ten o'clock the 7th corps made a fresh start. The marshal's first
 intention had been to direct it by way of Buzancy upon Stenay, where it
 would have passed the Meuse, but the Prussians, outmarching the army of
 Chalons, were already in Stenay, and were even reported to be at Buzancy.
 Crowded back in this manner to the northward, the 7th corps had received
 orders to move to la Besace, some twelve or fifteen miles from
 Boult-aux-Bois, whence, on the next day, they would proceed to pass the
 Meuse at Mouzon. The start was made in a very sulky humor; the men, with
 empty stomachs and bodies unrefreshed by repose, unnerved, mentally and
 physically, by the experience of the past few days, vented their
 dissatisfaction by growling and grumbling, while the officers, without a
 spark of their usual cheerful gayety, with a vague sense of impending
 disaster awaiting them at the end of their march, taxed the dilatoriness
 of their chiefs, and reproached them for not going to the assistance of
 the 5th corps at Buzancy, where the sound of artillery-firing had been
 heard. That corps, too, was on the retreat, making its way toward Nonart,
 while the 12th was even then leaving la Besace for Mouzon and the 1st was
 directing its course toward Raucourt. It was like nothing so much as the
 passage of a drove of panic-stricken cattle, with the dogs worrying them
 and snapping at their heels&mdash;a wild stampede toward the Meuse.
 </p>
 <p>
 When, in the outstreaming torrent of the three divisions that striped the
 plain with columns of marching men, the 106th left Boult-aux-Bois in the
 rear of the cavalry and artillery, the sky was again overspread with a
 pall of dull leaden clouds that further lowered the spirits of the
 soldiers. Its route was along the Buzancy highway, planted on either side
 with rows of magnificent poplars. When they reached Germond, a village
 where there was a steaming manure-heap before every one of the doors that
 lined the two sides of the straggling street, the sobbing women came to
 their thresholds with their little children in their arms, and held them
 out to the passing troops, as if begging the men to take them with them.
 There was not a mouthful of bread to be had in all the hamlet, nor even a
 potato, After that, the regiment, instead of keeping straight on toward
 Buzancy, turned to the left and made for Authe, and when the men turned
 their eyes across the plain and beheld upon the hilltop Belleville,
 through which they had passed the day before, the fact that they were
 retracing their steps was impressed more vividly on their consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Heavens and earth!" growled Chouteau, "do they take us for tops?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And Loubet chimed in:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Those cheap-John generals of ours are all at sea again! They must think
 that men's legs are cheap."
 </p>
 <p>
 The anger and disgust were general. It was not right to make men suffer
 like that, just for the fun of walking them up and down the country. They
 were advancing in column across the naked plain in two files occupying the
 sides of the road, leaving a free central space in which the officers
 could move to and fro and keep an eye on their men, but it was not the
 same now as it had been in Champagne after they left Rheims, a march of
 song and jollity, when they tramped along gayly and the knapsack was like
 a feather to their shoulders, in the belief that soon they would come up
 with the Prussians and give them a sound drubbing; now they were dragging
 themselves wearily forward in angry silence, cursing the musket that
 galled their shoulder and the equipments that seemed to weigh them to the
 ground, their faith in their leaders gone, and possessed by such
 bitterness of despair that they only went forward as does a file of
 manacled galley-slaves, in terror of the lash. The wretched army had begun
 to ascend its Calvary.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, however, within the last few minutes had made a discovery that
 interested him greatly. To their left was a range of hills that rose one
 above another as they receded from the road, and from the skirt of a
 little wood, far up on the mountain-side, he had seen a horseman emerge.
 Then another appeared, and then still another. There they stood, all three
 of them, without sign of life, apparently no larger than a man's hand and
 looking like delicately fashioned toys. He thought they were probably part
 of a detachment of our hussars out on a reconnoissance, when all at once
 he was surprised to behold little points of light flashing from their
 shoulders, doubtless the reflection of the sunlight from epaulets of
 brass.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look there!" he said, nudging Jean, who was marching at his side.
 "Uhlans!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The corporal stared with all his eyes. "They, uhlans!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They were indeed uhlans, the first Prussians that the 106th had set eyes
 on. They had been in the field nearly six weeks now, and in all that time
 not only had they never smelt powder, but had never even seen an enemy.
 The news spread through the ranks, and every head was turned to look at
 them. Not such bad-looking fellows, those uhlans, after all.
 </p>
 <p>
 "One of them looks like a jolly little fat fellow," Loubet remarked.
 </p>
 <p>
 But presently an entire squadron came out and showed itself on a plateau
 to the left of the little wood, and at sight of the threatening
 demonstration the column halted. An officer came riding up with orders,
 and the 106th moved off a little and took position on the bank of a small
 stream behind a clump of trees. The artillery had come hurrying back from
 the front on a gallop and taken possession of a low, rounded hill. For
 near two hours they remained there thus in line of battle without the
 occurrence of anything further; the body of hostile cavalry remained
 motionless in the distance, and finally, concluding that they were only
 wasting time that was valuable, the officers set the column moving again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah well," Jean murmured regretfully, "we are not booked for it this
 time."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, too, had felt his finger-tips tingling with the desire to have
 just one shot. He kept harping on the theme of the mistake they had made
 the day before in not going to the support of the 5th corps. If the
 Prussians had not made their attack yet, it must be because their infantry
 had not got up in sufficient strength, whence it was evident that their
 display of cavalry in the distance was made with no other end than to
 harass us and check the advance of our corps. We had again fallen into the
 trap set for us, and thenceforth the regiment was constantly greeted with
 the sight of uhlans popping up on its left flank wherever the ground was
 favorable for them, tracking it like sleuthhounds, disappearing behind a
 farmhouse only to reappear at the corner of a wood.
 </p>
 <p>
 It eventually produced a disheartening effect on the troops to see that
 cordon closing in on them in the distance and enveloping them as in the
 meshes of some gigantic, invisible net. Even Pache and Lapoulle had an
 opinion on the subject.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is beginning to be tiresome!" they said. "It would be a comfort to
 send them our compliments in the shape of a musket-ball!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But they kept toiling wearily onward on their tired feet, that seemed to
 them as if they were of lead. In the distress and suffering of that day's
 march there was ever present to all the undefined sensation of the
 proximity of the enemy, drawing in on them from every quarter, just as we
 are conscious of the coming storm before we have seen a cloud on the
 horizon. Instructions were given the rear-guard to use severe measures, if
 necessary, to keep the column well closed up; but there was not much
 straggling, aware as everyone was that the Prussians were close in our
 rear, and ready to snap up every unfortunate that they could lay hands on.
 Their infantry was coming up with the rapidity of the whirlwind, making
 its twenty-five miles a day, while the French regiments, in their
 demoralized condition, seemed in comparison to be marking time.
 </p>
 <p>
 At Authe the weather cleared, and Maurice, taking his bearings by the
 position of the sun, noticed that instead of bearing off toward Chene,
 which lay three good leagues from where they were, they had turned and
 were moving directly eastward. It was two o'clock; the men, after
 shivering in the rain for two days, were now suffering from the intense
 heat. The road ascended, with long sweeping curves, through a region of
 utter desolation: not a house, not a living being, the only relief to the
 dreariness of the waste lands an occasional little somber wood; and the
 oppressive silence communicated itself to the men, who toiled onward with
 drooping heads, bathed in perspiration. At last Saint-Pierremont appeared
 before them, a few empty houses on a small elevation. They did not pass
 through the village. Maurice observed that here they made a sudden wheel
 to the left, resuming their northern course, toward la Besace. He now
 understood the route that had been adopted in their attempt to reach
 Mouzon ahead of the Prussians; but would they succeed, with such weary,
 demoralized troops? At Saint-Pierremont the three uhlans had shown
 themselves again, at a turn in the road leading to Buzancy, and just as
 the rear-guard was leaving the village a battery was unmasked and a few
 shells came tumbling among them, without doing any injury, however. No
 response was attempted, and the march was continued with constantly
 increasing effort.
 </p>
 <p>
 From Saint-Pierremont to la Besace the distance is three good leagues, and
 when Maurice imparted that information to Jean the latter made a gesture
 of discouragement: the men would never be able to accomplish it; they
 showed it by their shortness of breath, by their haggard faces. The road
 continued to ascend, between gently sloping hills on either side that were
 gradually drawing closer together. The condition of the men necessitated a
 halt, but the only effect of their brief repose was to increase the
 stiffness of their benumbed limbs, and when the order was given to march
 the state of affairs was worse than it had been before; the regiments made
 no progress, men were everywhere falling in the ranks. Jean, noticing
 Maurice's pallid face and glassy eyes, infringed on what was his usual
 custom and conversed, endeavoring by his volubility to divert the other's
 attention and keep him awake as he moved automatically forward,
 unconscious of his actions.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Your sister lives in Sedan, you say; perhaps we shall be there before
 long."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, at Sedan? Never! You must be crazy; it don't lie in our way."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is your sister young?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Just my age; you know I told you we are twins."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is she like you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, she is fair-haired, too; and oh! such pretty curling hair! She is a
 mite of a woman, with a little thin face, not one of your noisy, flashy
 hoydens, ah, no!&mdash;Dear Henriette!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You love her very dearly!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 There was silence between them after that, and Jean, glancing at Maurice,
 saw that his eyes were closing and he was about to fall.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo there, old fellow! Come, confound it all, brace up! Let me take
 your gun a moment; that will give you a chance to rest. They can't have
 the cruelty to make us march any further to-day! we shall leave half our
 men by the roadside."
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment he caught sight of Osches lying straight ahead of them, its
 few poor hovels climbing in straggling fashion up the hillside, and the
 yellow church, embowered in trees, looking down on them from its perch
 upon the summit.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There's where we shall rest, for certain."
 </p>
 <p>
 He had guessed aright; General Douay saw the exhausted condition of the
 troops, and was convinced that it would be useless to attempt to reach la
 Besace that day. What particularly influenced his determination, however,
 was the arrival of the train, that ill-starred train that had been
 trailing in his rear since they left Rheims, and of which the nine long
 miles of vehicles and animals had so terribly impeded his movements. He
 had given instructions from Quatre-Champs to direct it straight on
 Saint-Pierremont, and it was not until Osches that the teams came up with
 the corps, in such a state of exhaustion that the horses refused to stir.
 It was now five o'clock; the general, not liking the prospect of
 attempting the pass of Stonne at that late hour, determined to take the
 responsibility of abridging the task assigned them by the marshal. The
 corps was halted and proceeded to encamp; the train below in the meadows,
 guarded by a division, while the artillery took position on the hills to
 the rear, and the brigade detailed to act as rear-guard on the morrow
 rested on a height facing Saint-Pierremont. The other division, which
 included Bourgain-Desfeuilles' brigade, bivouacked on a wide plateau,
 bordered by an oak wood, behind the church. There was such confusion in
 locating the bodies of troops that it was dark before the 106th could move
 into its position at the edge of the wood.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Zut</i>!" said Chouteau in a furious rage, "no eating for me; I want
 to sleep!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that was the cry of all; they were overcome with fatigue. Many of them
 lacked strength and courage to erect their tents, but dropping where they
 stood, at once fell fast asleep on the bare ground. In order to eat,
 moreover, rations would have been necessary, and the commissary wagons,
 which were waiting for the 7th corps to come to them at la Besace, could
 not well be at Osches at the same time. In the universal relaxation of
 order and system even the customary corporal's call was omitted: it was
 everyone for himself. There were to be no more issues of rations from that
 time forth; the soldiers were to subsist on the provisions they were
 supposed to carry in their knapsacks, and that evening the sacks were
 empty; few indeed were those who could muster a crust of bread or some
 crumbs of the abundance in which they had been living at Vouziers of late.
 There was coffee, and those who were not too tired made and drank it
 without sugar.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean thought to make a division of his wealth by eating one of his
 biscuits himself and giving the other to Maurice, he discovered that the
 latter was sound asleep. He thought at first he would awake him, but
 changed his mind and stoically replaced the biscuits in his sack,
 concealing them with as much caution as if they had been bags of gold; he
 could get along with coffee, like the rest of the boys. He had insisted on
 having the tent put up, and they were all stretched on the ground beneath
 its shelter when Loubet returned from a foraging expedition, bringing in
 some carrots that he had found in a neighboring field. As there was no
 fire to cook them by they munched them raw, but the vegetables only served
 to aggravate their hunger, and they made Pache ill.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; let him sleep," said Jean to Chouteau, who was shaking Maurice to
 wake him and give him his share.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah," Lapoulle broke in, "we shall be at Angouleme to-morrow, and then
 we'll have some bread. I had a cousin in the army once, who was stationed
 at Angouleme. Nice garrison, that."
 </p>
 <p>
 They all looked surprised, and Chouteau exclaimed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Angouleme&mdash;what are you talking about! Just listen to the bloody
 fool, saying he is at Angouleme!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was impossible to extract any explanation from Lapoulle. He had
 insisted that morning that the uhlans that they sighted were some of
 Bazaine's troops.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then darkness descended on the camp, black as ink, silent as death.
 Notwithstanding the coolness of the night air the men had not been
 permitted to make fires; the Prussians were known to be only a few miles
 away, and it would not do to put them on the alert; orders even were
 transmitted in a hushed voice. The officers had notified their men before
 retiring that the start would be made at about four in the morning, in
 order that they might have all the rest possible, and all had hastened to
 turn in and were sleeping greedily, forgetful of their troubles. Above the
 scattered camps the deep respiration of all those slumbering crowds,
 rising upon the stillness of the night, was like the long-drawn breathing
 of old Mother Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly a shot rang out in the darkness and aroused the sleepers. It was
 about three o'clock, and the obscurity was profound. Immediately everyone
 was on foot, the alarm spread through the camp; it was supposed the
 Prussians were attacking. It was only Loubet who, unable to sleep longer,
 had taken it in his head to make a foray into the oak-wood, which he
 thought gave promise of rabbits: what a jolly good lark it would be if he
 could bring in a pair of nice rabbits for the comrades' breakfast! But as
 he was looking about for a favorable place in which to conceal himself, he
 heard the sound of voices and the snapping of dry branches under heavy
 footsteps; men were coming toward him; he took alarm and discharged his
 piece, believing the Prussians were at hand. Maurice, Jean, and others
 came running up in haste, when a hoarse voice made itself heard:
 </p>
 <p>
 "For God's sake, don't shoot!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And there at the edge of the wood stood a tall, lanky man, whose thick,
 bristling beard they could just distinguish in the darkness. He wore a
 gray blouse, confined at the waist by a red belt, and carried a musket
 slung by a strap over his shoulder. He hurriedly explained that he was
 French, a sergeant of francs-tireurs, and had come with two of his men
 from the wood of Dieulet, bringing important information for the general.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo there, Cabasse! Ducat!" he shouted, turning his head, "hallo! you
 infernal poltroons, come here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The men were evidently badly scared, but they came forward. Ducat, short
 and fat, with a pale face and scanty hair; Cabasse short and lean, with a
 black face and a long nose not much thicker than a knife-blade.
 </p>
 <p>
 Meantime Maurice had stepped up and taken a closer look at the sergeant;
 he finally asked him:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Tell me, are you not Guillaume Sambuc, of Remilly?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And when the man hesitatingly answered in the affirmative Maurice recoiled
 a step or two, for this Sambuc had the reputation of being a particularly
 hard case, the worthy son of a family of woodcutters who had all gone to
 the bad, the drunken father being found one night lying by the roadside
 with his throat cut, the mother and daughter, who lived by begging and
 stealing, having disappeared, most likely, in the seclusion of some
 penitentiary. He, Guillaume, did a little in the poaching and smuggling
 lines, and only one of that litter of wolves' whelps had grown up to be an
 honest man, and that was Prosper, the hussar, who had gone to work on a
 farm before he was conscripted, because he hated the life of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I saw your brother at Vouziers," Maurice continued; "he is well."
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc made no reply. To end the situation he said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Take me to the general. Tell him that the francs-tireurs of the wood of
 Dieulet have something important to say to him."
 </p>
 <p>
 On the way back to the camp Maurice reflected on those free companies that
 had excited such great expectations at the time of their formation, and
 had since been the object of such bitter denunciation throughout the
 country. Their professed purpose was to wage a sort of guerilla warfare,
 lying in ambush behind hedges, harassing the enemy, picking off his
 sentinels, holding the woods, from which not a Prussian was to emerge
 alive; while the truth of the matter was that they had made themselves the
 terror of the peasantry, whom they failed utterly to protect and whose
 fields they devastated. Every ne'er-do-well who hated the restraints of
 the regular service made haste to join their ranks, well pleased with the
 chance that exempted him from discipline and enabled him to lead the life
 of a tramp, tippling in pothouses and sleeping by the roadside at his own
 sweet will. Some of the companies were recruited from the very worst
 material imaginable.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo there, Cabasse! Ducat!" Sambuc was constantly repeating, turning to
 his henchmen at every step he took, "Come along, will you, you snails!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was as little charmed with the two men as with their leader.
 Cabasse, the little lean fellow, was a native of Toulon, had served as
 waiter in a cafe at Marseilles, had failed at Sedan as a broker in
 southern produce, and finally had brought up in a police-court, where it
 came near going hard with him, in connection with a robbery of which the
 details were suppressed. Ducat, the little fat man, quondam <i>huissier</i>
 at Blainville, where he had been forced to sell out his business on
 account of a malodorous woman scrape, had recently been brought face to
 face with the court of assizes for an indiscretion of a similar nature at
 Raucourt, where he was accountant in a factory. The latter quoted Latin in
 his conversation, while the other could scarcely read, but the two were
 well mated, as unprepossessing a pair as one could expect to meet in a
 summer's day.
 </p>
 <p>
 The camp was already astir; Jean and Maurice took the francs-tireurs to
 Captain Beaudoin, who conducted them to the quarters of Colonel Vineuil.
 The colonel attempted to question them, but Sambuc, intrenching himself in
 his dignity, refused to speak to anyone except the general. Now
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles had taken up his quarters that night with the cure of
 Osches, and just then appeared, rubbing his eyes, in the doorway of the
 parsonage; he was in a horribly bad humor at his slumbers having been thus
 prematurely cut short, and the prospect that he saw before him of another
 day of famine and fatigue; hence his reception of the men who were brought
 before him was not exactly lamblike. Who were they? Whence did they come?
 What did they want? Ah, some of those francs-tireurs gentlemen&mdash;eh!
 Same thing as skulkers and riff-raff!
 </p>
 <p>
 "General," Sambuc replied, without allowing himself to be disconcerted,
 "we and our comrades are stationed in the woods of Dieulet&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "The woods of Dieulet&mdash;where's that?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Between Stenay and Mouzon, General."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What do I know of your Stenay and Mouzon? Do you expect me to be familiar
 with all these strange names?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel was distressed by his chief's display of ignorance; he hastily
 interfered to remind him that Stenay and Mouzon were on the Meuse, and
 that, as the Germans had occupied the former of those towns, the army was
 about to attempt the passage of the river at the other, which was situated
 more to the northward.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So you see, General," Sambuc continued, "we've come to tell you that the
 woods of Dieulet are alive with Prussians. There was an engagement
 yesterday as the 5th corps was leaving Bois-les-Dames, somewhere about
 Nonart&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, yesterday? There was fighting yesterday?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, General, the 5th corps was engaged as it was falling back; it must
 have been at Beaumont last night. So, while some of us hurried off to
 report to it the movements of the enemy, we thought it best to come and
 let you know how matters stood, so that you might go to its assistance,
 for it will certainly have sixty thousand men to deal with in the
 morning."
 </p>
 <p>
 General Bourgain-Desfeuilles gave a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Sixty thousand men! Why the devil don't you call it a hundred thousand at
 once? You were dreaming, young man; your fright has made you see double.
 It is impossible there should be sixty thousand Germans so near us without
 our knowing it."
 </p>
 <p>
 And so he went on. It was to no purpose that Sambuc appealed to Ducat and
 Cabasse to confirm his statement.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We saw the guns," the Provencal declared; "and those chaps must be crazy
 to take them through the forest, where the rains of the past few days have
 left the roads in such a state that they sink in the mud up to the hubs."
 </p>
 <p>
 "They have someone to guide them, for certain," said the ex-bailiff.
 </p>
 <p>
 Since leaving Vouziers the general had stoutly refused to attach any
 further credit to reports of the junction of the two German armies which,
 as he said, they had been trying to stuff down his throat. He did not even
 consider it worth his while to send the francs-tireurs before his corps
 commander, to whom the partisans supposed, all along, that they were
 talking; if they should attempt to listen to all the yarns that were
 brought them by tramps and peasants, they would have their hands full and
 be driven from pillar to post without ever advancing a step. He directed
 the three men to remain with the column, however, since they were
 acquainted with the country.
 </p>
 <p>
 "They are good fellows, all the same," Jean said to Maurice, as they were
 returning to fold the tent, "to have tramped three leagues across lots to
 let us know."
 </p>
 <p>
 The young man agreed with him and commended their action, knowing as he
 did the country, and deeply alarmed to hear that the Prussians were in
 Dieulet forest and moving on Sommanthe and Beaumont. He had flung himself
 down by the roadside, exhausted before the march had commenced, with a
 sorrowing heart and an empty stomach, at the dawning of that day which he
 felt was to be so disastrous for them all. Distressed to see him looking
 so pale, the corporal affectionately asked him:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you feeling so badly still? What is it? Does your foot pain you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice shook his head. His foot had ceased to trouble him, thanks to the
 big shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Then you are hungry." And Jean, seeing that he did not answer, took from
 his knapsack one of the two remaining biscuits, and with a falsehood for
 which he may be forgiven: "Here, take it; I kept your share for you. I ate
 mine a while ago."
 </p>
 <p>
 Day was breaking when the 7th corps marched out of Osches en route for
 Mouzon by way of la Besace, where they should have bivouacked. The train,
 cause of so many woes, had been sent on ahead, guarded by the first
 division, and if its own wagons, well horsed as for the most part they
 were, got over the ground at a satisfactory pace, the requisitioned
 vehicles, most of them empty, delayed the troops and produced sad
 confusion among the hills of the defile of Stonne. After leaving the
 hamlet of la Berliere the road rises more sharply between wooded hills on
 either side. Finally, about eight o'clock, the two remaining divisions got
 under way, when Marshal MacMahon came galloping up, vexed to find there
 those troops that he supposed had left la Besace that morning, with only a
 short march between them and Mouzon; his comment to General Douay on the
 subject was expressed in warm language. It was determined that the first
 division and the train should be allowed to proceed on their way to
 Mouzon, but that the two other divisions, that they might not be further
 retarded by this cumbrous advance-guard, should move by the way of
 Raucourt and Autrecourt so as to pass the Meuse at Villers. The movement
 to the north was dictated by the marshal's intense anxiety to place the
 river between his army and the enemy; cost what it might, they must be on
 the right bank that night. The rear-guard had not yet left Osches when a
 Prussian battery, recommencing the performance of the previous day, began
 to play on them from a distant eminence, over in the direction of
 Saint-Pierremont. They made the mistake of firing a few shots in reply;
 then the last of the troops filed out of the town.
 </p>
 <p>
 Until nearly eleven o'clock the 106th slowly pursued its way along the
 road which zigzags through the pass of Stonne between high hills. On the
 left hand the precipitous summits rear their heads, devoid of vegetation,
 while to the right the gentler slopes are clad with woods down to the
 roadside. The sun had come out again, and the heat was intense down in the
 inclosed valley, where an oppressive solitude prevailed. After leaving la
 Berliere, which lies at the foot of a lofty and desolate mountain
 surmounted by a Calvary, there is not a house to be seen, not a human
 being, not an animal grazing in the meadows. And the men, the day before
 so faint with hunger, so spent with fatigue, who since that time had had
 no food to restore, no slumber, to speak of, to refresh them, were now
 dragging themselves listlessly along, disheartened, filled with sullen
 anger.
 </p>
 <p>
 Soon after that, just as the men had been halted for a short rest along
 the roadside, the roar of artillery was heard away at their right; judging
 from the distinctness of the detonations the firing could not be more than
 two leagues distant. Upon the troops, weary with waiting, tired of
 retreating, the effect was magical; in the twinkling of an eye everyone
 was on his feet, eager, in a quiver of excitement, no longer mindful of
 his hunger and fatigue: why did they not advance? They preferred to fight,
 to die, rather than keep on flying thus, no one knew why or whither.
 </p>
 <p>
 General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, accompanied by Colonel de Vineuil, had
 climbed a hill on the right to reconnoiter the country. They were visible
 up there in a little clearing between two belts of wood, scanning the
 surrounding hills with their field-glasses, when all at once they
 dispatched an aide-de-camp to the column, with instructions to send up to
 them the francs-tireurs if they were still there. A few men, Jean and
 Maurice among them, accompanied the latter, in case there should be need
 of messengers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A beastly country this, with its everlasting hills and woods!" the
 general shouted, as soon as he caught sight of Sambuc. "You hear the music&mdash;where
 is it? where is the fighting going on?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc, with Ducat and Cabasse close at his heels, listened a moment
 before he answered, casting his eye over the wide horizon, and Maurice,
 standing beside him and gazing out over the panorama of valley and forest
 that lay beneath him, was struck with admiration. It was like a boundless
 sea, whose gigantic waves had been arrested by some mighty force. In the
 foreground the somber verdure of the woods made splashes of sober color on
 the yellow of the fields, while in the brilliant sunlight the distant
 hills were bathed in purplish vapors. And while nothing was to be seen,
 not even the tiniest smoke-wreath floating on the cloudless sky, the
 cannon were thundering away in the distance, like the muttering of a
 rising storm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here is Sommanthe, to the right," Sambuc said at last, pointing to a high
 hill crowned by a wood. "Yoncq lies off yonder to the left. The fighting
 is at Beaumont, General."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Either at Varniforet or Beaumont," Ducat observed.
 </p>
 <p>
 The general muttered below his breath: "Beaumont, Beaumont&mdash;a man can
 never tell where he is in this d&mdash;&mdash;d country." Then raising his
 voice: "And how far may this Beaumont be from here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "A little more than six miles, if you take the road from Chene to Stenay,
 which runs up the valley yonder."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no cessation of the firing, which seemed to be advancing from
 west to east with a continuous succession of reports like peals of
 thunder. Sambuc added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Bigre</i>! it's getting warm. It is just what I expected; you know
 what I told you this morning, General; it is certainly the batteries that
 we saw in the wood of Dieulet. By this time the whole army that came up
 through Buzancy and Beauclair is at work mauling the 5th corps."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was silence among them, while the battle raging in the distance
 growled more furiously than ever, and Maurice had to set tight his teeth
 to keep himself from speaking his mind aloud. Why did they not hasten
 whither the guns were calling them, without such waste of words? He had
 never known what it was to be excited thus; every discharge found an echo
 in his bosom and inspired him with a fierce longing to be present at the
 conflict, to put an end to it. Were they to pass by that battle, so near
 almost that they could stretch forth their arm and touch it with their
 hand, and never expend a cartridge? It must be to decide a wager that some
 one had made, that since the beginning of the campaign they were dragged
 about the country thus, always flying before the enemy! At Vouziers they
 had heard the musketry of the rear-guard, at Osches the German guns had
 played a moment on their retreating backs; and now they were to run for it
 again, they were not to be allowed to advance at double-quick to the
 succor of comrades in distress! Maurice looked at Jean, who was also very
 pale, his eyes shining with a bright, feverish light. Every heart leaped
 in every bosom at the loud summons of the artillery.
 </p>
 <p>
 While they were waiting a general, attended by his staff, was seen
 ascending the narrow path that wound up the hill. It was Douay, their
 corps-commander, who came hastening up, with anxiety depicted on his
 countenance, and when he had questioned the francs-tireurs he gave
 utterance to an exclamation of despair. But what could he have done, even
 had he learned their tidings that morning? The marshal's orders were
 explicit: they must be across the Meuse that night, cost what it might.
 And then again, how was he to collect his scattered troops, strung out
 along the road to Raucourt, and direct then on Beaumont? Could they arrive
 in time to be of use? The 5th corps must be in full retreat on Mouzon by
 that time, as was indicated by the sound of the firing, which was receding
 more and more to the eastward, as a deadly hurricane moves off after
 having accomplished its disastrous work. With a fierce gesture, expressive
 of his sense of impotency, General Douay outstretched his arms toward the
 wide horizon of hill and dale, of woods and fields, and the order went
 forth to proceed with the march to Raucourt.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, what a march was that through that dismal pass of Stonne, with the
 lofty summits o'erhanging them on either side, while through the woods on
 their right came the incessant volleying of the artillery. Colonel de
 Vineuil rode at the head of his regiment, bracing himself firmly in his
 saddle, his face set and very pale, his eyes winking like those of one
 trying not to weep. Captain Beaudoin strode along in silence, gnawing his
 mustache, while Lieutenant Rochas let slip an occasional imprecation,
 invoking ruin and destruction on himself and everyone besides. Even the
 most cowardly among the men, those who had the least stomach for fighting,
 were shamed and angered by their continuous retreat; they felt the bitter
 humiliation of turning their backs while those beasts of Prussians were
 murdering their comrades over yonder.
 </p>
 <p>
 After emerging from the pass the road, from a tortuous path among the
 hills, increased in width and led through a broad stretch of level
 country, dotted here and there with small woods. The 106th was now a
 portion of the rear-guard, and at every moment since leaving Osches had
 been expecting to feel the enemy's attack, for the Prussians were
 following the column step by step, never letting it escape their vigilant
 eyes, waiting, doubtless, for a favorable opportunity to fall on its rear.
 Their cavalry were on the alert to take advantage of any bit of ground
 that promised them an opportunity of getting in on our flank; several
 squadrons of Prussian Guards were seen advancing from behind a wood, but
 they gave up their purpose upon a demonstration made by a regiment of our
 hussars, who came up at a gallop, sweeping the road. Thanks to the
 breathing-spell afforded them by this circumstance the retreat went on in
 sufficiently good order, and Raucourt was not far away, when a spectacle
 greeted their eyes that filled them with consternation and completely
 demoralized the troops. Upon coming to a cross-road they suddenly caught
 sight of a hurrying, straggling, flying throng, wounded officers, soldiers
 without arms and without organization, runaway teams from the train, all&mdash;men
 and animals&mdash;mingled in wildest confusion, wild with panic. It was
 the wreck of one of the brigades of the 1st division, which had been sent
 that morning to escort the train to Mouzon; there had been an unfortunate
 misconception of orders, and this brigade and a portion of the wagons had
 taken a wrong road and reached Varniforet, near Beaumont, at the very time
 when the 5th corps was being driven back in disorder. Taken unawares,
 overborne by the flank attack of an enemy superior in numbers, they had
 fled; and bleeding, with haggard faces, crazed with fear, were now
 returning to spread consternation among their comrades; it was as if they
 had been wafted thither on the breath of the battle that had been raging
 incessantly since noon.
 </p>
 <p>
 Alarm and anxiety possessed everyone, from highest to lowest, as the
 column poured through Raucourt in wild stampede. Should they turn to the
 left, toward Autrecourt, and attempt to pass the Meuse at Villers, as had
 been previously decided? The general hesitated, fearing to encounter
 difficulties in crossing there, even if the bridge were not already in
 possession of the Prussians; he finally decided to keep straight on
 through the defile of Harancourt and thus reach Remilly before nightfall.
 First Mouzon, then Villers, and last Remilly; they were still pressing on
 northward, with the tramp of the uhlans on the road behind them. There
 remained scant four miles for them to accomplish, but it was five o'clock,
 and the men were sinking with fatigue. They had been under arms since
 daybreak, twelve hours had been consumed in advancing three short leagues;
 they were harassed and fatigued as much by their constant halts and the
 stress of their emotions as by the actual toil of the march. For the last
 two nights they had had scarce any sleep; their hunger had been unappeased
 since they left Vouziers. In Raucourt the distress was terrible; men fell
 in the ranks from sheer inanition.
 </p>
 <p>
 The little town is rich, with its numerous factories, its handsome
 thoroughfare lined with two rows of well-built houses, and its pretty
 church and <i>mairie</i>; but the night before Marshal MacMahon and the
 Emperor had passed that way with their respective staffs and all the
 imperial household, and during the whole of the present morning the entire
 1st corps had been streaming like a torrent through the main street. The
 resources of the place had not been adequate to meet the requirements of
 these hosts; the shelves of the bakers and grocers were empty, and even
 the houses of the bourgeois had been swept clean of provisions; there was
 no bread, no wine, no sugar, nothing capable of allaying hunger or thirst.
 Ladies had been seen to station themselves before their doors and deal out
 glasses of wine and cups of bouillon until cask and kettle alike were
 drained of their last drop. And so there was an end, and when, about three
 o'clock, the first regiments of the 7th corps began to appear the scene
 was a pitiful one; the broad street was filled from curb to curb with
 weary, dust-stained men, dying with hunger, and there was not a mouthful
 of food to give them. Many of them stopped, knocking at doors and
 extending their hands beseechingly toward windows, begging for a morsel of
 bread, and women were seen to cry and sob as they motioned that they could
 not help them, that they had nothing left.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the corner of the Rue Dix-Potiers Maurice had an attack of dizziness
 and reeled as if about to fall. To Jean, who came hastening up, he said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, leave me; it is all up with me. I may as well die here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had sunk down upon a door-step. The corporal spoke in a rough tone of
 displeasure assumed for the occasion:
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> why don't you try to behave like a soldier! Do you
 want the Prussians to catch you? Come, get up!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, as the young man, lividly pale, his eyes tight-closed, almost
 unconscious, made no reply, he let slip another oath, but in another key
 this time, in a tone of infinite gentleness and pity:
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> <i>Nom de Dieu!</i>"
 </p>
 <p>
 And running to a drinking-fountain near by, he filled his basin with water
 and hurried back to bathe his friend's face. Then, without further attempt
 at concealment, he took from his sack the last remaining biscuit that he
 had guarded with such jealous caution, and commenced crumbling it into
 small bits that he introduced between the other's teeth. The famishing man
 opened his eyes and ate greedily.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But you," he asked, suddenly recollecting himself, "how comes it that you
 did not eat it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, I!" said Jean. "I'm tough, I can wait. A good drink of Adam's ale,
 and I shall be all right."
 </p>
 <p>
 He went and filled his basin again at the fountain, emptied it at a single
 draught, and came back smacking his lips in token of satisfaction with his
 feast. He, too, was cadaverously pale, and so faint with hunger that his
 hands were trembling like a leaf.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, get up, and let's be going. We must be getting back to the
 comrades, little one."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice leaned on his arm and suffered himself to be helped along as if he
 had been a child; never had woman's arm about him so warmed his heart. In
 that extremity of distress, with death staring him in the face, it
 afforded him a deliciously cheering sense of comfort to know that someone
 loved and cared for him, and the reflection that that heart, which was so
 entirely his, was the heart of a simple-minded peasant, whose aspirations
 scarcely rose above the satisfaction of his daily wants, for whom he had
 recently experienced a feeling of repugnance, served to add to his
 gratitude a sensation of ineffable joy. Was it not the brotherhood that
 had prevailed in the world in its earlier days, the friendship that had
 existed before caste and culture were; that friendship which unites two
 men and makes them one in their common need of assistance, in the presence
 of Nature, the common enemy? He felt the tie of humanity uniting him and
 Jean, and was proud to know that the latter, his comforter and savior, was
 stronger than he; while to Jean, who did not analyze his sensations, it
 afforded unalloyed pleasure to be the instrument of protecting, in his
 friend, that cultivation and intelligence which, in himself, were only
 rudimentary. Since the death of his wife, who had been snatched away from
 him by a frightful catastrophe, he had believed that his heart was dead,
 he had sworn to have nothing more to do with those creatures, who, even
 when they are not wicked and depraved, are cause of so much suffering to
 man. And thus, to both of them their friendship was a comfort and relief.
 There was no need of any demonstrative display of affection; they
 understood each other; there was close community of sympathy between them,
 and, notwithstanding their apparent external dissimilarity, the bond of
 pity and common suffering made them as one during their terrible march
 that day to Remilly.
 </p>
 <p>
 As the French rear-guard left Raucourt by one end of the town the Germans
 came in at the other, and forthwith two of their batteries commenced
 firing from the position they had taken on the heights to the left; the
 106th, retreating along the road that follows the course of the Emmane,
 was directly in the line of fire. A shell cut down a poplar on the bank of
 the stream; another came and buried itself in the soft ground close to
 Captain Beaudoin, but did not burst. From there on to Harancourt, however,
 the walls of the pass kept approaching nearer and nearer, and the troops
 were crowded together in a narrow gorge commanded on either side by hills
 covered with trees. A handful of Prussians in ambush on those heights
 might have caused incalculable disaster. With the cannon thundering in
 their rear and the menace of a possible attack on either flank, the men's
 uneasiness increased with every step they took, and they were in haste to
 get out of such a dangerous neighborhood; hence they summoned up their
 reserved strength, and those soldiers who, but now in Raucourt, had scarce
 been able to drag themselves along, now, with the peril that lay behind
 them as an incentive, struck out at a good round pace. The very horses
 seemed to be conscious that the loss of a minute might cost them dear. And
 the impetus thus given continued; all was going well, the head of the
 column must have reached Remilly, when, all at once, their progress was
 arrested.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Heavens and earth!" said Chouteau, "are they going to leave us here in
 the road?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The regiment had not yet reached Harancourt, and the shells were still
 tumbling about them; while the men were marking time, awaiting the word to
 go ahead again, one burst, on the right of the column, without injuring
 anyone, fortunately. Five minutes passed, that seemed to them long as an
 eternity, and still they did not move; there was some obstacle on ahead
 that barred their way as effectually as if a strong wall had been built
 across the road. The colonel, standing up in his stirrups, peered
 nervously to the front, for he saw that it would require but little to
 create a panic among his men.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are betrayed; everybody can see it," shouted Chouteau.
 </p>
 <p>
 Murmurs of reproach arose on every side, the sullen muttering of their
 discontent exasperated by their fears. Yes, yes! they had been brought
 there to be sold, to be delivered over to the Prussians. In the baleful
 fatality that pursued them, and among all the blunders of their leaders,
 those dense intelligences were unable to account for such an uninterrupted
 succession of disasters on any other ground than that of treachery.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are betrayed! we are betrayed!" the men wildly repeated.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Loubet's fertile intellect evolved an idea: "It is like enough that
 that pig of an Emperor has sat himself down in the road, with his baggage,
 on purpose to keep us here."
 </p>
 <p>
 The idle fancy was received as true, and immediately spread up and down
 the line; everyone declared that the imperial household had blocked the
 road and was responsible for the stoppage. There was a universal chorus of
 execration, of opprobrious epithets, an unchaining of the hatred and
 hostility that were inspired by the insolence of the Emperor's attendants,
 who took possession of the towns where they stopped at night as if they
 owned them, unpacking their luxuries, their costly wines and plate of gold
 and silver, before the eyes of the poor soldiers who were destitute of
 everything, filling the kitchens with the steam of savory viands while
 they, poor devils, had nothing for it but to tighten the belt of their
 trousers. Ah! that wretched Emperor, that miserable man, deposed from his
 throne and stripped of his command, a stranger in his own empire; whom
 they were conveying up and down the country along with the other baggage,
 like some piece of useless furniture, whose doom it was ever to drag
 behind him the irony of his imperial state: cent-gardes, horses,
 carriages, cooks, and vans, sweeping, as it were, the blood and mire from
 the roads of his defeat with the magnificence of his court mantle,
 embroidered with the heraldic bees!
 </p>
 <p>
 In rapid succession, one after the other, two more shells fell; Lieutenant
 Rochas had his <i>kepi</i> carried away by a fragment. The men huddled
 closer together and began to crowd forward, the movement gathering
 strength as it ran from rear to front. Inarticulate cries were heard,
 Lapoulle shouted furiously to go ahead. A minute longer and there would
 have been a horrible catastrophe, and many men must have been crushed to
 death in the mad struggle to escape from the funnel-like gorge.
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel&mdash;he was very pale&mdash;turned and spoke to the soldiers:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My children, my children, be a little patient. I have sent to see what is
 the matter&mdash;it will only be a moment&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But they did not advance, and the seconds seemed like centuries. Jean,
 quite cool and collected, resumed his hold of Maurice's hand, and
 whispered to him that, in case their comrades began to shove, they two
 could leave the road, climb the hill on the left, and make their way to
 the stream. He looked about to see where the francs-tireurs were, thinking
 he might gain some information from them regarding the roads, but was told
 they had vanished while the column was passing through Raucourt. Just then
 the march was resumed, and almost immediately a bend in the road took them
 out of range of the German batteries. Later in the day it was ascertained
 that it was four cuirassier regiments of Bonnemain's division who, in the
 disorder of that ill-starred retreat, had thus blocked the road of the 7th
 corps and delayed the march.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was nearly dark when the 106th passed through Angecourt. The wooded
 hills continued on the right, but to the left the country was more level,
 and a valley was visible in the distance, veiled in bluish mists. At last,
 just as the shades of night were descending, they stood on the heights of
 Remilly and beheld a ribbon of pale silver unrolling its length upon a
 broad expanse of verdant plain. It was the Meuse, that Meuse they had so
 longed to see, and where it seemed as if victory awaited them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Pointing to some lights in the distance that were beginning to twinkle
 cheerily among the trees, down in that fertile valley that lay there so
 peaceful in the mellow twilight, Maurice said to Jean, with the glad
 content of a man revisiting a country that he knows and loves:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look! over that way&mdash;that is Sedan!"
 </p>
 <p>
 <a name="link2H_4_0009" id="link2H_4_0009">

 <h2>
 VII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Remilly is built on a hill that rises from the left bank of the Meuse,
 presenting the appearance of an amphitheater; the one village street that
 meanders circuitously down the sharp descent was thronged with men,
 horses, and vehicles in dire confusion. Half-way up the hill, in front of
 the church, some drivers had managed to interlock the wheels of their
 guns, and all the oaths and blows of the artillerymen were unavailing to
 get them forward. Further down, near the woolen mill, where the Emmane
 tumbles noisily over the dam, the road was choked with a long line of
 stranded baggage wagons, while close at hand, at the inn of the Maltese
 Cross, a constantly increasing crowd of angry soldiers pushed and
 struggled, and could not obtain so much as a glass of wine.
 </p>
 <p>
 All this mad hurly-burly was going on at the southern end of the village,
 which is here separated from the Meuse by a little grove of trees, and
 where the engineers had that morning stretched a bridge of boats across
 the river. There was a ferry to the right; the ferryman's house stood by
 itself, white and staring, amid a rank growth of weeds. Great fires had
 been built on either bank, which, being replenished from time to time,
 glared ruddily in the darkness and made the stream and both its shores as
 light as day. They served to show the immense multitude of men massed
 there, awaiting a chance to cross, while the footway only permitted the
 passage of two men abreast, and over the bridge proper the cavalry and
 artillery were obliged to proceed at a walk, so that the crossing promised
 to be a protracted operation. It was said that the troops still on the
 left bank comprised a brigade of the 1st corps, an ammunition train, and
 the four regiments of cuirassiers belonging to Bonnemain's division, while
 coming up in hot haste behind them was the 7th corps, over thirty thousand
 strong, possessed with the belief that the enemy was at their heels and
 pushing on with feverish eagerness to gain the security of the other
 shore.
 </p>
 <p>
 For a while despair reigned. What! they had been marching since morning
 with nothing to eat, they had summoned up all their energies to escape
 that deadly trap at Harancourt pass, only in the end to be landed in that
 slough of despond, with an insurmountable wall staring them in the face!
 It would be hours, perhaps, before it became the last comer's turn to
 cross, and everyone knew that even if the Prussians should not be
 enterprising enough to continue their pursuit in the darkness they would
 be there with the first glimpse of daylight. Orders came for them to stack
 muskets, however, and they made their camp on the great range of bare
 hills which slope downward to the meadows of the Meuse, with the Mouzon
 road running at their base. To their rear and occupying the level plateau
 on top of the range the guns of the reserve artillery were arranged in
 battery, pointed so as to sweep the entrance of the pass should there be
 necessity for it. And thus commenced another period of agonized, grumbling
 suspense.
 </p>
 <p>
 When finally the preparations were all completed the 106th found
 themselves posted in a field of stubble above the road, in a position that
 commanded a view of the broad plain. The men had parted regretfully with
 their arms, casting timorous looks behind them that showed they were
 apprehensive of a night attack. Their faces were stern and set, and
 silence reigned, only broken from time to time by some sullen murmur of
 angry complaint. It was nearly nine o'clock, they had been there two
 hours, and yet many of them, notwithstanding their terrible fatigue, could
 not sleep; stretched on the bare ground, they would start and bend their
 ears to catch the faintest sound that rose in the distance. They had
 ceased to fight their torturing hunger; they would eat over yonder, on the
 other bank, when they had passed the river; they would eat grass if
 nothing else was to be found. The crowd at the bridge, however, seemed to
 increase rather than diminish; the officers that General Douay had
 stationed there came back to him every few minutes, always bringing the
 same unwelcome report, that it would be hours and hours before any relief
 could be expected. Finally the general determined to go down to the bridge
 in person, and the men saw him on the bank, bestirring himself and others
 and hurrying the passage of the troops.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, seated with Jean against a wall, pointed to the north, as he had
 done before. "There is Sedan in the distance. And look! Bazeilles is over
 yonder&mdash;and then comes Douzy, and then Carignan, more to the right.
 We shall concentrate at Carignan, I feel sure we shall. Ah! there is
 plenty of room, as you would see if it were daylight!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And his sweeping gesture embraced the entire valley that lay beneath them,
 enfolded in shadow. There was sufficient light remaining in the sky that
 they could distinguish the pale gleam of the river where it ran its course
 among the dusky meadows. The scattered trees made clumps of denser shade,
 especially a row of poplars to the left, whose tops were profiled on the
 horizon like the fantastic ornaments on some old castle gateway. And in
 the background, behind Sedan, dotted with countless little points of
 brilliant light, the shadows had mustered, denser and darker, as if all
 the forests of the Ardennes had collected the inky blackness of their
 secular oaks and cast it there.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's gaze came back to the bridge of boats beneath them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look there! everything is against us. We shall never get across."
 </p>
 <p>
 The fires upon both banks blazed up more brightly just then, and their
 light was so intense that the whole fearful scene was pictured on the
 darkness with vivid distinctness. The boats on which the longitudinal
 girders rested, owing to the weight of the cavalry and artillery that had
 been crossing uninterruptedly since morning, had settled to such an extent
 that the floor of the bridge was covered with water. The cuirassiers were
 passing at the time, two abreast, in a long unbroken file, emerging from
 the obscurity of the hither shore to be swallowed up in the shadows of the
 other, and nothing was to be seen of the bridge; they appeared to be
 marching on the bosom of the ruddy stream, that flashed and danced in the
 flickering firelight. The horses snorted and hung back, manifesting every
 indication of terror as they felt the unstable pathway yielding beneath
 their feet, and the cuirassiers, standing erect in their stirrups and
 clutching at the reins, poured onward in a steady, unceasing stream,
 wrapped in their great white mantles, their helmets flashing in the red
 light of the flames. One might have taken them for some spectral band of
 knights, with locks of fire, going forth to do battle with the powers of
 darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's suffering wrested from him a deep-toned exclamation:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! I am hungry!"
 </p>
 <p>
 On every side, meantime, the men, notwithstanding the complainings of
 their empty stomachs, had thrown themselves down to sleep. Their fatigue
 was so great that it finally got the better of their fears and struck them
 down upon the bare earth, where they lay on their back, with open mouth
 and arms outstretched, like logs beneath the moonless sky. The bustle of
 the camp was stilled, and all along the naked range, from end to end,
 there reigned a silence as of death.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! I am hungry; I am so hungry that I could eat dirt!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, patient as he was and inured to hardship, could not restrain the
 cry; he had eaten nothing in thirty-six hours, and it was torn from him by
 sheer stress of physical suffering. Then Maurice, knowing that two or
 three hours at all events must elapse before their regiment could move to
 pass the stream, said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, I have an uncle not far from here&mdash;you know, Uncle
 Fouchard, of whom you have heard me speak. His house is five or six
 hundred yards from here; I didn't like the idea, but as you are so hungry&mdash;The
 deuce! the old man can't refuse us bread!"
 </p>
 <p>
 His comrade made no objection and they went off together. Father
 Fouchard's little farm was situated just at the mouth of Harancourt pass,
 near the plateau where the artillery was posted. The house was a low
 structure, surrounded by quite an imposing cluster of dependencies; a
 barn, a stable, and cow-sheds, while across the road was a disused
 carriage-house which the old peasant had converted into an abattoir, where
 he slaughtered with his own hands the cattle which he afterward carried
 about the country in his wagon to his customers.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was surprised as he approached the house to see no light.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, the old miser! he has locked and barred everything tight and fast.
 Like as not he won't let us in."
 </p>
 <p>
 But something that he saw brought him to a standstill. Before the house a
 dozen soldiers were moving to and fro, hungry plunderers, doubtless, on
 the prowl in quest of something to eat. First they had called, then had
 knocked, and now, seeing that the place was dark and deserted, they were
 hammering at the door with the butts of their muskets in an attempt to
 force it open. A growling chorus of encouragement greeted them from the
 outsiders of the circle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> go ahead! smash it in, since there is no one at
 home!"
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once the shutter of a window in the garret was thrown back and a
 tall old man presented himself, bare-headed, wearing the peasant's blouse,
 with a candle in one hand and a gun in the other. Beneath the thick shock
 of bristling white hair was a square face, deeply seamed and wrinkled,
 with a strong nose, large, pale eyes, and stubborn chin.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You must be robbers, to smash things as you are doing!" he shouted in an
 angry tone. "What do you want?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The soldiers, taken by surprise, drew back a little way.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are perishing with hunger; we want something to eat."
 </p>
 <p>
 "I have nothing, not a crust. Do you suppose that I keep victuals in my
 house to fill a hundred thousand mouths? Others were here before you; yes,
 General Ducrot's men were here this morning, I tell you, and they cleaned
 me out of everything."
 </p>
 <p>
 The soldiers came forward again, one by one.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let us in, all the same; we can rest ourselves, and you can hunt up
 something&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And they were commencing to hammer at the door again, when the old fellow,
 placing his candle on the window-sill, raised his gun to his shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
 "As true as that candle stands there, I'll put a hole in the first man
 that touches that door!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The prospect looked favorable for a row. Oaths and imprecations resounded,
 and one of the men was heard to shout that they would settle matters with
 the pig of a peasant, who was like all the rest of them and would throw
 his bread in the river rather than give a mouthful to a starving soldier.
 The light of the candle glinted on the barrels of the chassepots as they
 were brought to an aim; the angry men were about to shoot him where he
 stood, while he, headstrong and violent, would not yield an inch.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Nothing, nothing! Not a crust! I tell you they cleaned me out!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice rushed in in affright, followed by Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Comrades, comrades&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 He knocked up the soldiers' guns, and raising his eyes, said entreatingly:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, be reasonable. Don't you know me? It is I."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who, I?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Maurice Levasseur, your nephew."
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard took up his candle. He recognized his nephew, beyond a
 doubt, but was firm in his resolve not to give so much as a glass of
 water.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How can I tell whether you are my nephew or not in this infernal
 darkness? Clear out, everyone of you, or I will fire!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And amid an uproar of execration, and threats to bring him down and burn
 the shanty, he still had nothing to say but: "Clear out, or I'll fire!"
 which he repeated more than twenty times.
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly a loud clear voice was heard rising above the din:
 </p>
 <p>
 "But not on me, father?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The others stood aside, and in the flickering light of the candle a man
 appeared, wearing the chevrons of a quartermaster-sergeant. It was Honore,
 whose battery was a short two hundred yards from there and who had been
 struggling for the last two hours against an irresistible longing to come
 and knock at that door. He had sworn never to set foot in that house
 again, and in all his four years of army life had not exchanged a single
 letter with that father whom he now addressed so curtly. The marauders had
 drawn apart and were conversing excitedly among themselves; what, the old
 man's son, and a "non-com."! it wouldn't answer; better go and try their
 luck elsewhere! So they slunk away and vanished in the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Fouchard saw that he had nothing more to fear he said in a
 matter-of-course way, as if he had seen his son only the day before:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's you&mdash;All right, I'll come down."
 </p>
 <p>
 His descent was a matter of time. He could be heard inside the house
 opening locked doors and carefully fastening them again, the maneuvers of
 a man determined to leave nothing at loose ends. At last the door was
 opened, but only for a few inches, and the strong grasp that held it would
 let it go no further.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come in, <i>thou</i>! and no one besides!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He could not turn away his nephew, however, notwithstanding his manifest
 repugnance.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, thou too!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He shut the door flat in Jean's face, in spite of Maurice's entreaties.
 But he was obdurate. No, no! he wouldn't have it; he had no use for
 strangers and robbers in his house, to smash and destroy his furniture!
 Finally Honore shoved their comrade inside the door by main strength and
 the old man had to make the best of it, grumbling and growling
 vindictively. He had carried his gun with him all this time. When at last
 he had ushered the three men into the common sitting-room and had stood
 his gun in a corner and placed the candle on the table, he sank into a
 mulish silence.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, father, we are perishing with hunger. You will let us have a little
 bread and cheese, won't you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He made a pretense of not hearing and did not answer, turning his head at
 every instant toward the window as if listening for some other band that
 might be coming to lay siege to his house.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Uncle, Jean has been a brother to me; he deprived himself of food to give
 it to me. And we have seen such suffering together!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He turned and looked about the room to assure himself that nothing was
 missing, not giving the three soldiers so much as a glance, and at last,
 still without a word spoken, appeared to come to a decision. He suddenly
 arose, took the candle and went out, leaving them in darkness and
 carefully closing and locking the door behind him in order that no one
 might follow him. They could hear his footsteps on the stairs that led to
 the cellar. There was another long period of waiting, and when he
 returned, again locking and bolting everything after him, he placed upon
 the table a big loaf of bread and a cheese, amid a silence which, once his
 anger had blown over, was merely the result of cautious cunning, for no
 one can ever tell what may come of too much talking. The three men threw
 themselves ravenously upon the food, and the only sound to be heard in the
 room was the fierce grinding of their jaws.
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore rose, and going to the sideboard brought back a pitcher of water.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I think you might have given us some wine, father."
 </p>
 <p>
 Whereupon Fouchard, now master of himself and no longer fearing that this
 anger might lead him into unguarded speech, once more found his tongue.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wine! I haven't any, not a drop! The others, those fellows of Ducrot's,
 ate and drank all I had, robbed me of everything!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He was lying, and try to conceal it as he might the shifty expression in
 his great light eyes showed it. For the past two days he had been driving
 away his cattle, as well those reserved for work on the farm as those he
 had purchased to slaughter, and hiding them, no one knew where, in the
 depths of some wood or in some abandoned quarry, and he had devoted hours
 to burying all his household stores, wine, bread, and things of the least
 value, even to the flour and salt, so that anyone might have ransacked his
 cupboards and been none the richer for it. He had refused to sell anything
 to the first soldiers who came along; no one knew, he might be able to do
 better later on; and the patient, sly old curmudgeon indulged himself with
 vague dreams of wealth.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who was first to satisfy his appetite, commenced to talk.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Have you seen my sister Henriette lately?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The old man was pacing up and down the room, casting an occasional glance
 at Jean, who was bolting huge mouthfuls of bread; after apparently giving
 the subject long consideration he deliberately answered:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Henriette, yes, I saw her last month when I was in Sedan. But I saw
 Weiss, her husband, this morning. He was with Monsieur Delaherche, his
 boss, who had come over in his carriage to see the soldiers at Mouzon&mdash;which
 is the same as saying that they were out for a good time."
 </p>
 <p>
 An expression of intense scorn flitted over the old peasant's impenetrable
 face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Perhaps they saw more of the army than they wanted to, and didn't have
 such a very good time after all, for ever since three o'clock the roads
 have been impassable on account of the crowds of flying soldiers."
 </p>
 <p>
 In the same unmoved voice, as if the matter were one of perfect
 indifference to him, he gave them some tidings of the defeat of the 5th
 corps, that had been surprised at Beaumont while the men were making their
 soup and chased by the Bavarians all the way to Mouzon. Some fugitives who
 had passed through Remilly, mad with terror, had told him that they had
 been betrayed once more and that de Failly had sold them to Bismarck.
 Maurice's thoughts reverted to the aimless, blundering movements of the
 last two days, to Marshal MacMahon hurrying on their retreat and insisting
 on getting them across the Meuse at every cost, after wasting so many
 precious hours in incomprehensible delays. It was too late. Doubtless the
 marshal, who had stormed so on finding the 7th corps still at Osches when
 he supposed it to be at la Besace, had felt assured that the 5th corps was
 safe in camp at Mouzon when, lingering in Beaumont, it had come to grief
 there. But what could they expect from troops so poorly officered,
 demoralized by suspense and incessant retreat, dying with hunger and
 fatigue?
 </p>
 <p>
 Fouchard had finally come and planted himself behind Jean's chair,
 watching with astonishment the inroads he was making on the bread and
 cheese. In a coldly sarcastic tone he asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you beginning to feel better, <i>hein</i>?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The corporal raised his head and replied with the same peasant-like
 directness:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Just beginning, thank you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore, notwithstanding his hunger, had ceased from eating whenever it
 seemed to him that he heard a noise about the house. If he had struggled
 long, and finally been false to his oath never to set foot in that house
 again, the reason was that he could no longer withstand his craving desire
 to see Silvine. The letter that he had received from her at Rheims lay on
 his bosom, next his skin, that letter, so tenderly passionate, in which
 she told him that she loved him still, that she should never love anyone
 save him, despite the cruel past, despite Goliah and little Charlot, that
 man's child. He was thinking of naught save her, was wondering why he had
 not seen her yet, all the time watching himself that he might not let his
 father see his anxiety. At last his passion became too strong for him,
 however, and he asked in a tone as natural as he could command:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is not Silvine with you any longer?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Fouchard gave his son a glance out of the corner of his eye, chuckling
 internally.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then he expectorated and was silent, so that the artillery man had
 presently to broach the subject again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "She has gone to bed, then?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no."
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally the old fellow condescended to explain that he, too, had been
 taking an outing that morning, had driven over to Raucourt market in his
 wagon and taken his little servant with him. He saw no reason, because a
 lot of soldiers happened to pass that way, why folks should cease to eat
 meat or why a man should not attend to his business, so he had taken a
 sheep and a quarter of beef over there, as it was his custom to do every
 Tuesday, and had just disposed of the last of his stock-in-trade when up
 came the 7th corps and he found himself in the middle of a terrible
 hubbub. Everyone was running, pushing, and crowding. Then he became
 alarmed lest they should take his horse and wagon from him, and drove off,
 leaving his servant, who was just then making some purchases in the town.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, Silvine will come back all right," he concluded in his tranquil
 voice. "She must have taken shelter with Doctor Dalichamp, her godfather.
 You would think to look at her that she wouldn't dare to say boo to a
 goose, but she is a girl of courage, all the same. Yes, yes; she has lots
 of good qualities, Silvine has."
 </p>
 <p>
 Was it an attempt on his part to be jocose? or did he wish to explain why
 it was he kept her in his service, that girl who had caused dissension
 between father and son, whose child by the Prussian was in the house? He
 again gave his boy that sidelong look and laughed his voiceless laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Little Charlot is asleep there in his room; she surely won't be long
 away, now."
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore, with quivering lips, looked so intently at his father that the old
 man began to pace the floor again. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> yes, the child was
 there; doubtless he would have to look on him. A painful silence filled
 the room, while he mechanically cut himself more bread and began to eat
 again. Jean also continued his operations in that line, without finding it
 necessary to say a word. Maurice contemplated the furniture, the old
 sideboard, the antique clock, and reflected on the long summer days that
 he had spent at Remilly in bygone times with his sister Henriette. The
 minutes slipped away, the clock struck eleven.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The devil!" he murmured, "it will never do to let the regiment go off
 without us!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He stepped to the window and opened it, Fouchard making no objection.
 Beneath lay the valley, a great bowl filled to the brim with blackness;
 presently, however, when his eyes became more accustomed to the obscurity,
 he had no difficulty in distinguishing the bridge, illuminated by the
 fires on the two banks. The cuirassiers were passing still, like phantoms
 in their long white cloaks, while their steeds trod upon the bosom of the
 stream and a chill wind of terror breathed on them from behind; and so the
 spectral train moved on, apparently interminable, in an endless,
 slow-moving vision of unsubstantial forms. Toward the right, over the bare
 hills where the slumbering army lay, there brooded a stillness and repose
 like death.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah well!" said Maurice with a gesture of disappointment, "'twill be
 to-morrow morning."
 </p>
 <p>
 He had left the window open, and Father Fouchard, seizing his gun,
 straddled the sill and stepped outside, as lightly as a young man. For a
 time they could hear his tramp upon the road, as regular as that of a
 sentry pacing his beat, but presently it ceased and the only sound that
 reached their ears was the distant clamor on the crowded bridge; it must
 be that he had seated himself by the wayside, where he could watch for
 approaching danger and at slightest sign leap to defend his property.
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore's anxiety meantime was momentarily increasing; his eyes were fixed
 constantly on the clock. It was less than four miles from Raucourt to
 Remilly, an easy hour's walk for a woman as young and strong as Silvine.
 Why had she not returned in all that time since the old man lost sight of
 her in the confusion? He thought of the disorder of a retreating army
 corps, spreading over the country and blocking the roads; some accident
 must certainly have happened, and he pictured her in distress, wandering
 among the lonely fields, trampled under foot by the horsemen.
 </p>
 <p>
 But suddenly the three men rose to their feet, moved by a common impulse.
 There was a sound of rapid steps coming up the road and the old man was
 heard to cock his weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who goes there?" he shouted. "Is it you, Silvine?"
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no reply. He repeated his question, threatening to fire. Then a
 laboring, breathless voice managed to articulate:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, Father Fouchard; it is I." And she quickly asked: "And
 Charlot?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "He is abed and asleep."
 </p>
 <p>
 "That is well! Thanks."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no longer cause for her to hasten; she gave utterance to a
 deep-drawn sigh, as if to rid herself of her burden of fatigue and
 distress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go in by the window," said Fouchard. "There is company in there."
 </p>
 <p>
 She was greatly agitated when, leaping lightly into the room, she beheld
 the three men. In the uncertain candle-light she gave the impression of
 being very dark, with thick black hair and a pair of large, fine, lustrous
 eyes, the chief adornment of a small oval face, strong by reason of its
 tranquil resignation. The sudden meeting with Honore had sent all the
 blood rushing from her heart to her cheeks; and yet she was hardly
 surprised to find him there; he had been in her thoughts all the way home
 from Raucourt.
 </p>
 <p>
 He, trembling with agitation, his heart in his throat, spoke with affected
 calmness:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-evening, Silvine."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-evening, Honore."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, to keep from breaking down and bursting into tears, she turned away,
 and recognizing Maurice, gave him a smile. Jean's presence was
 embarrassing to her. She felt as if she were choking somehow, and removed
 the <i>foulard</i> that she wore about her neck.
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore continued, dropping the friendly <i>thou</i> of other days:
 </p>
 <p>
 "We were anxious about you, Silvine, on account of the Prussians being so
 near at hand."
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once her face became very pale and showed great distress; raising
 her hand to her eyes as if to shut out some atrocious vision, and
 directing an involuntary glance toward the room where Charlot was
 slumbering, she murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "The Prussians&mdash;Oh! yes, yes, I saw them."
 </p>
 <p>
 Sinking wearily upon a chair she told how, when the 7th corps came into
 Raucourt, she had fled for shelter to the house of her godfather, Doctor
 Dalichamp, hoping that Father Fouchard would think to come and take her up
 before he left the town. The main street was filled with a surging throng,
 so dense that not even a dog could have squeezed his way through it, and
 up to four o'clock she had felt no particular alarm, tranquilly employed
 in scraping lint in company with some of the ladies of the place; for the
 doctor, with the thought that they might be called on to care for some of
 the wounded, should there be a battle over in the direction of Metz and
 Verdun, had been busying himself for the last two weeks with improvising a
 hospital in the great hall of the <i>mairie</i>. Some people who dropped
 in remarked that they might find use for their hospital sooner than they
 expected, and sure enough, a little after midday, the roar of artillery
 had reached their ears from over Beaumont way. But that was not near
 enough to cause anxiety and no one was alarmed, when, all at once, just as
 the last of the French troops were filing out of Raucourt, a shell, with a
 frightful crash, came tearing through the roof of a neighboring house. Two
 others followed in quick succession; it was a German battery shelling the
 rear-guard of the 7th corps. Some of the wounded from Beaumont had already
 been brought in to the <i>mairie</i>, where it was feared that the enemy's
 projectiles would finish them as they lay on their mattresses waiting for
 the doctor to come and operate on them. The men were crazed with fear, and
 would have risen and gone down into the cellars, notwithstanding their
 mangled limbs, which extorted from them shrieks of agony.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And then," continued Silvine, "I don't know how it happened, but all at
 once the uproar was succeeded by a deathlike stillness. I had gone
 upstairs and was looking from a window that commanded a view of the street
 and fields. There was not a soul in sight, not a 'red-leg' to be seen
 anywhere, when I heard the tramp, tramp of heavy footsteps, and then a
 voice shouted something that I could not understand and all the muskets
 came to the ground together with a great crash. And I looked down into the
 street below, and there was a crowd of small, dirty-looking men in black,
 with ugly, big faces and wearing helmets like those our firemen wear.
 Someone told me they were Bavarians. Then I raised my eyes again and saw,
 oh! thousands and thousands of them, streaming in by the roads, across the
 fields, through the woods, in serried, never-ending columns. In the
 twinkling of an eye the ground was black with them, a black swarm, a swarm
 of black locusts, coming thicker and thicker, so that, in no time at all,
 the earth was hid from sight."
 </p>
 <p>
 She shivered and repeated her former gesture, veiling her vision from some
 atrocious spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And the things that occurred afterward would exceed belief. It seems
 those men had been marching three days, and on top of that had fought at
 Beaumont like tigers; hence they were perishing with hunger, their eyes
 were starting from their sockets, they were beside themselves. The
 officers made no effort to restrain them; they broke into shops and
 private houses, smashing doors and windows, demolishing furniture,
 searching for something to eat and drink, no matter what, bolting whatever
 they could lay their hands on. I saw one in the shop of Monsieur Simonin,
 the grocer, ladling molasses from a cask with his helmet. Others were
 chewing strips of raw bacon, others again had filled their mouths with
 flour. They were told that our troops had been passing through the town
 for the last two days and there was nothing left, but here and there they
 found some trifling store that had been hid away, not sufficient to feed
 so many hungry mouths, and that made them think the folks were lying to
 them, and they went on to smash things more furiously than ever. In less
 than an hour, there was not a butcher's, grocer's, or baker's shop in the
 city left ungutted; even the private houses were entered, their cellars
 emptied, and their closets pillaged. At the doctor's&mdash;did you ever
 hear of such a thing? I caught one big fellow devouring the soap. But the
 cellar was the place where they did most mischief; we could hear them from
 upstairs smashing the bottles and yelling like demons, and they drew the
 spigots of the casks, so that the place was flooded with wine; when they
 came out their hands were red with the good wine they had spilled. And to
 show what happens, men when they make such brutes of themselves: a soldier
 found a large bottle of laudanum and drank it all down, in spite of
 Monsieur Dalichamp's efforts to prevent him. The poor wretch was in
 horrible agony when I came away; he must be dead by this time."
 </p>
 <p>
 A great shudder ran through her, and she put her hand to her eyes to shut
 out the horrid sight.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no! I cannot bear it; I saw too much!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard had crossed the road and stationed himself at the open
 window where he could hear, and the tale of pillage made him uneasy; he
 had been told that the Prussians paid for all they took; were they going
 to start out as robbers at that late day? Maurice and Jean, too, were
 deeply interested in those details about an enemy whom the girl had seen,
 and whom they had not succeeded in setting eyes on in their whole month's
 campaigning, while Honore, pensive and with dry, parched lips, was
 conscious only of the sound of <i>her</i> voice; he could think of nothing
 save her and the misfortune that had parted them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Just then the door of the adjoining room was opened, and little Charlot
 appeared. He had heard his mother's voice, and came trotting into the
 apartment in his nightgown to give her a kiss. He was a chubby, pink
 little urchin, large and strong for his age, with a thatch of curling,
 straw-colored hair and big blue eyes. Silvine shivered at his sudden
 appearance, as if the sight of him had recalled to her mind the image of
 someone else that affected her disagreeably. Did she no longer recognize
 him, then, her darling child, that she looked at him thus, as if he were
 some evocation of that horrid nightmare! She burst into tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor, poor child!" she exclaimed, and clasped him wildly to her
 breast, while Honore, ghastly pale, noted how strikingly like the little
 one was to Goliah; the same broad, pink face, the true Teutonic type, in
 all the health and strength of rosy, smiling childhood. The son of the
 Prussian, <i>the Prussian</i>, as the pothouse wits of Remilly had styled
 him! And the French mother, who sat there, pressing him to her bosom, her
 heart still bleeding with the recollection of the cruel sights she had
 witnessed that day!
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor child, be good; come with me back to bed. Say good-night, my poor
 child."
 </p>
 <p>
 She vanished, bearing him away. When she returned from the adjoining room
 she was no longer weeping; her face wore its customary expression of calm
 and courageous resignation.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Honore who, with a trembling voice, started the conversation again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And what did the Prussians do then?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes; the Prussians. Well, they plundered right and left, destroying
 everything, eating and drinking all they could lay hands on. They stole
 linen as well, napkins and sheets, and even curtains, tearing them in
 strips to make bandages for their feet. I saw some whose feet were one raw
 lump of flesh, so long and hard had been their march. One little group I
 saw, seated at the edge of the gutter before the doctor's house, who had
 taken off their shoes and were bandaging themselves with handsome
 chemises, trimmed with lace, stolen, doubtless, from pretty Madame
 Lefevre, the manufacturer's wife. The pillage went on until night. The
 houses had no doors or windows left, and one passing in the street could
 look within and see the wrecked furniture, a scene of destruction that
 would have aroused the anger of a saint. For my part, I was almost wild,
 and could remain there no longer. They tried in vain to keep me, telling
 me that the roads were blocked, that I would certainly be killed; I
 started, and as soon as I was out of Raucourt, struck off to the right and
 took to the fields. Carts, loaded with wounded French and Prussians, were
 coming in from Beaumont. Two passed quite close to me in the darkness; I
 could hear the shrieks and groans, and I ran, oh! how I ran, across
 fields, through woods, I could not begin to tell you where, except that I
 made a wide circuit over toward Villers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Twice I thought I heard soldiers coming and hid, but the only person I
 met was another woman, a fugitive like myself. She was from Beaumont, she
 said, and she told me things too horrible to repeat. After that we ran
 harder than ever. And at last I am here, so wretched, oh! so wretched with
 what I have seen!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Her tears flowed again in such abundance as to choke her utterance. The
 horrors of the day kept rising to her memory and would not down; she
 related the story that the woman of Beaumont had told her. That person
 lived in the main street of the village, where she had witnessed the
 passage of all the German artillery after nightfall. The column was
 accompanied on either side of the road by a file of soldiers bearing
 torches of pitch-pine, which illuminated the scene with the red glare of a
 great conflagration, and between the flaring, smoking lights the impetuous
 torrent of horses, guns, and men tore onward at a mad gallop. Their feet
 were winged with the tireless speed of victory as they rushed on in
 devilish pursuit of the French, to overtake them in some last ditch and
 crush them, annihilate them there. They stopped for nothing; on, on they
 went, heedless of what lay in their way. Horses fell; their traces were
 immediately cut, and they were left to be ground and torn by the pitiless
 wheels until they were a shapeless, bleeding mass. Human beings, prisoners
 and wounded men, who attempted to cross the road, were ruthlessly borne
 down and shared their fate. Although the men were dying with hunger the
 fierce hurricane poured on unchecked; was a loaf thrown to the drivers,
 they caught it flying; the torch-bearers passed slices of meat to them on
 the end of their bayonets, and then, with the same steel that had served
 that purpose, goaded their maddened horses on to further effort. And the
 night grew old, and still the artillery was passing, with the mad roar of
 a tempest let loose upon the land, amid the frantic cheering of the men.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's fatigue was too much for him, and notwithstanding the interest
 with which he listened to Silvine's narrative, after the substantial meal
 he had eaten he let his head decline upon the table on his crossed arms.
 Jean's resistance lasted a little longer, but presently he too was
 overcome and fell dead asleep at the other end of the table. Father
 Fouchard had gone and taken his position in the road again; Honore was
 alone with Silvine, who was seated, motionless, before the still open
 window.
 </p>
 <p>
 The artilleryman rose, and drawing his chair to the window, stationed
 himself there beside her. The deep peacefulness of the night was instinct
 with the breathing of the multitude that lay lost in slumber there, but on
 it now rose other and louder sounds; the straining and creaking of the
 bridge, the hollow rumble of wheels; the artillery was crossing on the
 half-submerged structure. Horses reared and plunged in terror at sight of
 the swift-running stream, the wheel of a caisson ran over the guard-rail;
 immediately a hundred strong arms seized the encumbrance and hurled the
 heavy vehicle to the bottom of the river that it might not obstruct the
 passage. And as the young man watched the slow, toilsome retreat along the
 opposite bank, a movement that had commenced the day before and certainly
 would not be ended by the coming dawn, he could not help thinking of that
 other artillery that had gone storming through Beaumont, bearing down all
 before it, crushing men and horses in its path that it might not be
 delayed the fraction of a second.
 </p>
 <p>
 Honore drew his chair nearer to Silvine, and in the shuddering darkness,
 alive with all those sounds of menace, gently whispered:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are unhappy?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! yes; so unhappy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She was conscious of the subject on which he was about to speak, and her
 head sank sorrowfully on her bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Tell me, how did it happen? I wish to know."
 </p>
 <p>
 But she could not find words to answer him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Did he take advantage of you, or was it with your consent?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then she stammered, in a voice that was barely audible:
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> I do not know; I swear to you, I do not know, more than
 a babe unborn. I will not lie to you&mdash;I cannot! No, I have no excuse
 to offer; I cannot say he beat me. You had left me, I was beside myself,
 and it happened, how, I cannot, no, I cannot tell!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Sobs choked her utterance, and he, ashy pale and with a great lump rising
 in his throat, waited silently for a moment. The thought that she was
 unwilling to tell him a lie, however, was an assuagement to his rage and
 grief; he went on to question her further, anxious to know the many
 things, that as yet he had been unable to understand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My father has kept you here, it seems?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She replied with her resigned, courageous air, without raising her eyes:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I work hard for him, it does not cost much to keep me, and as there is
 now another mouth to feed he has taken advantage of it to reduce my wages.
 He knows well enough that now, when he orders, there is nothing left for
 me but to obey."
 </p>
 <p>
 "But why do you stay with him?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The question surprised her so that she looked him in the face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Where would you have me go? Here my little one and I have at least a home
 and enough to keep us from starving."
 </p>
 <p>
 They were silent again, both intently reading in the other's eyes, while
 up the shadowy valley the sounds of the sleeping camp came faintly to
 their ears, and the dull rumble of wheels upon the bridge of boats went on
 unceasingly. There was a shriek, the loud, despairing cry of man or beast
 in mortal peril, that passed, unspeakably mournful, through the dark
 night.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen, Silvine," Honore slowly and feelingly went on; "you sent me a
 letter that afforded me great pleasure. I should have never come back
 here, but that letter&mdash;I have been reading it again this evening&mdash;speaks
 of things that could not have been expressed more delicately&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had turned pale when first she heard the subject mentioned. Perhaps he
 was angry that she had dared to write to him, like one devoid of shame;
 then, as his meaning became more clear, her face reddened with delight.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I know you to be truthful, and knowing it, I believe what you wrote in
 that letter&mdash;yes, I believe it now implicitly. You were right in
 supposing that, if I were to die in battle without seeing you again, it
 would be a great sorrow to me to leave this world with the thought that
 you no longer loved me. And therefore, since you love me still, since I am
 your first and only love&mdash;" His tongue became thick, his emotion was
 so deep that expression failed him. "Listen, Silvine; if those beasts of
 Prussians let me live, you shall yet be mine, yes, as soon as I have
 served my time out we will be married."
 </p>
 <p>
 She rose and stood erect upon her feet, gave a cry of joy, and threw
 herself upon the young man's bosom. She could not speak a word; every drop
 of blood in her veins was in her cheeks. He seated himself upon the chair
 and drew her down upon his lap.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I have thought the matter over carefully; it was to say what I have said
 that I came here this evening. Should my father refuse us his consent, the
 earth is large; we will go away. And your little one, no one shall harm
 him, <i>mon Dieu!</i> More will come along, and among them all I shall not
 know him from the others."
 </p>
 <p>
 She was forgiven, fully and entirely. Such happiness seemed too great to
 be true; she resisted, murmuring:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, it cannot be; it is too much; perhaps you might repent your
 generosity some day. But how good it is of you, Honore, and how I love
 you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He silenced her with a kiss upon the lips, and strength was wanting her
 longer to put aside the great, the unhoped-for good fortune that had come
 to her; a life of happiness where she had looked forward to one of
 loneliness and sorrow! With an involuntary, irresistible impulse she threw
 her arms about him, kissing him again and again, straining him to her
 bosom with all her woman's strength, as a treasure that was lost and found
 again, that was hers, hers alone, that thenceforth no one was ever to take
 from her. He was hers once more, he whom she had lost, and she would die
 rather than let anyone deprive her of him.
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment confused sounds reached their ears; the sleeping camp was
 awaking amid a tumult that rose and filled the dark vault of heaven.
 Hoarse voices were shouting orders, bugles were sounding, drums beating,
 and from the naked fields shadowy forms were seen emerging in
 indistinguishable masses, a surging, billowing sea whose waves were
 already streaming downward to the road beneath. The fires on the banks of
 the stream were dying down; all that could be seen there was masses of men
 moving confusedly to and fro; it was not even possible to tell if the
 movement across the river was still in progress. Never had the shades of
 night veiled such depths of distress, such abject misery of terror.
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard came to the window and shouted that the troops were
 moving. Jean and Maurice awoke, stiff and shivering, and got on their
 feet. Honore took Silvine's hands in his and gave them a swift parting
 clasp.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is a promise. Wait for me."
 </p>
 <p>
 She could find no word to say in answer, but all her soul went out to him
 in one long, last look, as he leaped from the window and hurried away to
 find his battery.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-by, father!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-by, my boy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that was all; peasant and soldier parted as they had met, without
 embracing, like a father and son whose existence was of little import to
 each other.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean also left the farmhouse, and descended the steep hill on
 a run. When they reached the bottom the 106th was nowhere to be found; the
 regiments had all moved off. They made inquiries, running this way and
 that, and were directed first one way and then another. At last, when they
 had near lost their wits in the fearful confusion, they stumbled on their
 company, under the command of Lieutenant Rochas; as for the regiment and
 Captain Beaudoin, no one could say where they were. And Maurice was
 astounded when he noticed for the first time that that mob of men, guns,
 and horses was leaving Remilly and taking the Sedan road that lay on the
 left bank. Something was wrong again; the passage of the Meuse was
 abandoned, they were in full retreat to the north!
 </p>
 <p>
 An officer of chasseurs, who was standing near, spoke up in a loud voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> the time for us to make the movement was the 28th,
 when we were at Chene!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Others were more explicit in their information; fresh news had been
 received. About two o'clock in the morning one of Marshal MacMahon's aides
 had come riding up to say to General Douay that the whole army was ordered
 to retreat immediately on Sedan, without loss of a minute's time. The
 disaster of the 5th corps at Beaumont had involved the three other corps.
 The general, who was at that time down at the bridge of boats
 superintending operations, was in despair that only a portion of his 3d
 division had so far crossed the stream; it would soon be day, and they
 were liable to be attacked at any moment. He therefore sent instructions
 to the several organizations of his command to make at once for Sedan,
 each independently of the others, by the most direct roads, while he
 himself, leaving orders to burn the bridge of boats, took the road on the
 left bank with his 2d division and the artillery, and the 3d division
 pursued that on the right bank; the 1st, that had felt the enemy's claws
 at Beaumont, was flying in disorder across the country, no one knew where.
 Of the 7th corps, that had not seen a battle, all that remained were those
 scattered, incoherent fragments, lost among lanes and by-roads, running
 away in the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not yet three o'clock, and the night was as black as ever. Maurice,
 although he knew the country, could not make out where they were in the
 noisy, surging throng that filled the road from ditch to ditch, pouring
 onward like a brawling mountain stream. Interspersed among the regiments
 were many fugitives from the rout at Beaumont, in ragged uniforms,
 begrimed with blood and dirt, who inoculated the others with their own
 terror. Down the wide valley, from the wooded hills across the stream,
 came one universal, all-pervading uproar, the scurrying tramp of other
 hosts in swift retreat; the 1st corps, coming from Carignan and Douzy, the
 12th flying from Mouzon with the shattered remnants of the 5th, moved like
 puppets and driven onward, all of them, by that one same, inexorable,
 irresistible pressure that since the 28th had been urging the army
 northward and driving it into the trap where it was to meet its doom.
 </p>
 <p>
 Day broke as Maurice's company was passing through Pont Maugis, and then
 he recognized their locality, the hills of Liry to the left, the Meuse
 running beside the road on the right. Bazeilles and Balan presented an
 inexpressibly funereal aspect, looming among the exhalations of the
 meadows in the chill, wan light of dawn, while against the somber
 background of her great forests Sedan was profiled in livid outlines,
 indistinct as the creation of some hideous nightmare. When they had left
 Wadelincourt behind them and were come at last to the Torcy gate, the
 governor long refused them admission; he only yielded, after a protracted
 conference, upon their threat to storm the place. It was five o'clock when
 at last the 7th corps, weary, cold, and hungry, entered Sedan.

 <h2>
 VIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 In the crush on the Place de Torcy that ensued upon the entrance of the
 troops into the city Jean became separated from Maurice, and all his
 attempts to find him again among the surging crowd were fruitless. It was
 a piece of extreme ill-luck, for he had accepted the young man's
 invitation to go with him to his sister's, where there would be rest and
 food for them, and even the luxury of a comfortable bed. The confusion was
 so great&mdash;the regiments disintegrated, no discipline, and no officers
 to enforce it&mdash;that the men were free to do pretty much as they
 pleased. There was plenty of time to look about them and hunt up their
 commands; they would have a few hours of sleep first.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean in his bewilderment found himself on the viaduct of Torcy,
 overlooking the broad meadows which, by the governor's orders, had been
 flooded with water from the river. Then, passing through another archway
 and crossing the Pont de Meuse, he entered the old, rampart-girt city,
 where, among the tall and crowded houses and the damp, narrow streets, it
 seemed to him that night was descending again, notwithstanding the
 increasing daylight. He could not so much as remember the name of
 Maurice's brother-in-law; he only knew that his sister's name was
 Henriette. The outlook was not encouraging; all that kept him awake was
 the automatic movement of walking; he felt that he should drop were he to
 stop. The indistinct ringing in his ears was the same that is experienced
 by one drowning; he was only conscious of the ceaseless onpouring of the
 stream of men and animals that carried him along with it on its current.
 He had partaken of food at Remilly, sleep was now his great necessity; and
 the same was true of the shadowy bands that he saw flitting past him in
 those strange, fantastic streets. At every moment a man would sink upon
 the sidewalk or tumble into a doorway, and there would remain, as if
 struck by death.
 </p>
 <p>
 Raising his eyes, Jean read upon a signboard: Avenue de la
 Sous-Prefecture. At the end of the street was a monument standing in a
 public garden, and at the corner of the avenue he beheld a horseman, a
 chasseur d'Afrique, whose face seemed familiar to him. Was it not Prosper,
 the young man from Remilly, whom he had seen in Maurice's company at
 Vouziers? Perhaps he had been sent in with dispatches. He had dismounted,
 and his skeleton of a horse, so weak that he could scarcely stand, was
 trying to satisfy his hunger by gnawing at the tail-board of an army wagon
 that was drawn up against the curb. There had been no forage for the
 animals for the last two days, and they were literally dying of
 starvation. The big strong teeth rasped pitifully on the woodwork of the
 wagon, while the soldier stood by and wept as he watched the poor brute.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was moving away when it occurred to him that the trooper might be
 able to give him the address of Maurice's sister. He returned, but the
 other was gone, and it would have been useless to attempt to find him in
 that dense throng. He was utterly disheartened, and wandering aimlessly
 from street to street at last found himself again before the
 Sous-Prefecture, whence he struggled onward to the Place Turenne. Here he
 was comforted for an instant by catching sight of Lieutenant Rochas,
 standing in front of the Hotel de Ville with a few men of his company, at
 the foot of the statue he had seen before; if he could not find his friend
 he could at all events rejoin the regiment and have a tent to sleep under.
 Nothing had been seen of Captain Beaudoin; doubtless he had been swept
 away in the press and landed in some place far away, while the lieutenant
 was endeavoring to collect his scattered men and fruitlessly inquiring of
 everyone he met where division headquarters were. As he advanced into the
 city, however, his numbers, instead of increasing, dwindled. One man, with
 the gestures of a lunatic, entered an inn and was seen no more. Three
 others were halted in front of a grocer's shop by a party of zouaves who
 had obtained possession of a small cask of brandy; one was already lying
 senseless in the gutter, while the other two tried to get away, but were
 too stupid and dazed to move. Loubet and Chouteau had nudged each other
 with the elbow and disappeared down a blind alley in pursuit of a fat
 woman with a loaf of bread, so that all who remained with the lieutenant
 were Pache and Lapoulle, with some ten or a dozen more.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas was standing by the base of the bronze statue of Turenne, making
 heroic efforts to keep his eyes open. When he recognized Jean he murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, is it you, corporal? Where are your men?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, by a gesture expressive in its vagueness, intimated that he did not
 know, but Pache, pointing to Lapoulle, answered with tears in his eyes:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here we are; there are none left but us two. The merciful Lord have pity
 on our sufferings; it is too hard!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The other, the colossus with the colossal appetite, looked hungrily at
 Jean's hands, as if to reproach them for being always empty in those days.
 Perhaps, in his half-sleeping state, he had dreamed that Jean was away at
 the commissary's for rations.
 </p>
 <p>
 "D&mdash;&mdash;n the luck!" he grumbled, "we'll have to tighten up our
 belts another hole!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Gaude, the bugler, was leaning against the iron railing, waiting for the
 lieutenant's order to sound the assembly; sleep came to him so suddenly
 that he slid from his position and within a second was lying flat on his
 back, unconscious. One by one they all succumbed to the drowsy influence
 and snored in concert, except Sergeant Sapin alone, who, with his little
 pinched nose in his small pale face, stood staring with distended eyes at
 the horizon of that strange city, as if trying to read his destiny there.
 </p>
 <p>
 Lieutenant Rochas meantime had yielded to an irresistible impulse and
 seated himself on the ground. He attempted to give an order.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Corporal, you will&mdash;you will&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that was as far as he could proceed, for fatigue sealed his lips, and
 like the rest he suddenly sank down and was lost in slumber.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, not caring to share his comrades' fate and pillow his head on the
 hard stones, moved away; he was bent on finding a bed in which to sleep.
 At a window of the Hotel of the Golden Cross, on the opposite side of the
 square, he caught a glimpse of General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, already
 half-undressed and on the point of tasting the luxury of clean white
 sheets. Why should he be more self-denying than the rest of them? he asked
 himself; why should he suffer longer? And just then a name came to his
 recollection that caused him a thrill of delight, the name of the
 manufacturer in whose employment Maurice's brother-in-law was. M.
 Delaherche! yes, that was it. He accosted an old man who happened to be
 passing.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can you tell me where M. Delaherche lives?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "In the Rue Maqua, near the corner of the Rue au Beurre; you can't mistake
 it; it is a big house, with statues in the garden."
 </p>
 <p>
 The old man turned away, but presently came running back. "I see you
 belong to the 106th. If it is your regiment you are looking for, it left
 the city by the Chateau, down there. I just met the colonel, Monsieur de
 Vineuil; I used to know him when he lived at Mezieres."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Jean went his way, with an angry gesture of impatience. No, no! no
 sleeping on the hard ground for him, now that he was certain of finding
 Maurice. And yet he could not help feeling a twinge of remorse as he
 thought of the dignified old colonel, who stood fatigue so manfully in
 spite of his years, sharing the sufferings of his men, with no more
 luxurious shelter than his tent. He strode across the Grande Rue with
 rapid steps and soon was in the midst of the tumult and uproar of the
 city; there he hailed a small boy, who conducted him to the Rue Maqua.
 </p>
 <p>
 There it was that in the last century a grand-uncle of the present
 Delaherche had built the monumental structure that had remained in the
 family a hundred and sixty years. There is more than one cloth factory in
 Sedan that dates back to the early years of Louis XV.; enormous piles,
 they are, covering as much ground as the Louvre, and with stately facades
 of royal magnificence. The one in the Rue Maqua was three stories high,
 and its tall windows were adorned with carvings of severe simplicity,
 while the palatial courtyard in the center was filled with grand old
 trees, gigantic elms that were coeval with the building itself. In it
 three generations of Delaherches had amassed comfortable fortunes for
 themselves. The father of Charles, the proprietor in our time, had
 inherited the property from a cousin who had died without being blessed
 with children, so that it was now a younger branch that was in possession.
 The affairs of the house had prospered under the father's control, but he
 was something of a blade and a roisterer, and his wife's existence with
 him was not one of unmixed happiness; the consequence of which was that
 the lady, when she became a widow, not caring to see a repetition by the
 son of the performances of the father, made haste to find a wife for him
 in the person of a simple-minded and exceedingly devout young woman, and
 subsequently kept him tied to her apron string until he had attained the
 mature age of fifty and over. But no one in this transitory world can tell
 what time has in store for him; when the devout young person's time came
 to leave this life Delaherche, who had known none of the joys of youth,
 fell head over ears in love with a young widow of Charleville, pretty
 Madame Maginot, who had been the subject of some gossip in her day, and in
 the autumn preceding the events recorded in this history had married her,
 in spite of all his mother's prayers and tears. It is proper to add that
 Sedan, which is very straitlaced in its notions of propriety, has always
 been inclined to frown on Charleville, the city of laughter and levity.
 And then again the marriage would never have been effected but for the
 fact that Gilberte's uncle was Colonel de Vineuil, who it was supposed
 would soon be made a general. This relationship and the idea that he had
 married into army circles was to the cloth manufacturer a source of great
 delight.
 </p>
 <p>
 That morning Delaherche, when he learned that the army was to pass through
 Mouzon, had invited Weiss, his accountant, to accompany him on that
 carriage ride of which we have heard Father Fouchard speak to Maurice.
 Tall and stout, with a florid complexion, prominent nose and thick lips,
 he was of a cheerful, sanguine temperament and had all the French
 bourgeois' boyish love for a handsome display of troops. Having
 ascertained from the apothecary at Mouzon that the Emperor was at Baybel,
 a farm in the vicinity, he had driven up there; had seen the monarch, and
 even had been near speaking to him, an adventure of such thrilling
 interest that he had talked of it incessantly ever since his return. But
 what a terrible return that had been, over roads choked with the
 panic-stricken fugitives from Beaumont! twenty times their cabriolet was
 near being overturned into the ditch. Obstacle after obstacle they had
 encountered, and it was night before the two men reached home. The element
 of the tragic and unforeseen there was in the whole business, that army
 that Delaherche had driven out to pass in review and which had brought him
 home with it, whether he would or no, in the mad gallop of its retreat,
 made him repeat again and again during their long drive:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I supposed it was moving on Verdun and would have given anything rather
 than miss seeing it. Ah well! I have seen it now, and I am afraid we shall
 see more of it in Sedan than we desire."
 </p>
 <p>
 The following morning he was awakened at five o'clock by the hubbub, like
 the roar of water escaping from a broken dam, made by the 7th corps as it
 streamed through the city; he dressed in haste and went out, and almost
 the first person he set eyes on in the Place Turenne was Captain Beaudoin.
 When pretty Madame Maginot was living at Charleville the year before the
 captain had been one of her best friends, and Gilberte had introduced him
 to her husband before they were married. Rumor had it that the captain had
 abdicated his position as first favorite and made way for the cloth
 merchant from motives of delicacy, not caring to stand in the way of the
 great good fortune that seemed coming to his fair friend.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo, is that you?" exclaimed Delaherche. "Good Heavens, what a state
 you're in!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was but too true; the dandified Beaudoin, usually so trim and spruce,
 presented a sorry spectacle that morning in his soiled uniform and with
 his grimy face and hands. Greatly to his disgust he had had a party of
 Turcos for traveling companions, and could not explain how he had become
 separated from his company. Like all the others he was ready to drop with
 fatigue and hunger, but that was not what most afflicted him; he had not
 been able to change his linen since leaving Rheims, and was inconsolable.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Just think of it!" he wailed, "those idiots, those scoundrels, lost my
 baggage at Vouziers. If I ever catch them I will break every bone in their
 body! And now I haven't a thing, not a handkerchief, not a pair of socks!
 Upon my word, it is enough to make one mad!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche was for taking him home to his house forthwith, but he
 resisted. No, no; he was no longer a human being, he would not frighten
 people out of their wits. The manufacturer had to make solemn oath that
 neither his wife nor his mother had risen yet; and besides he should have
 soap, water, linen, everything he needed.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was seven o'clock when Captain Beaudoin, having done what he could with
 the means at his disposal to improve his appearance, and comforted by the
 sensation of wearing under his uniform a clean shirt of his host's, made
 his appearance in the spacious, high-ceiled dining room with its somber
 wainscoting. The elder Madame Delaherche was already there, for she was
 always on foot at daybreak, notwithstanding she was seventy-eight years
 old. Her hair was snowy white; in her long, lean face was a nose almost
 preternaturally thin and sharp and a mouth that had long since forgotten
 how to laugh. She rose, and with stately politeness invited the captain to
 be seated before one of the cups of <i>cafe au lait</i> that stood on the
 table.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But, perhaps, sir, you would prefer meat and wine after the fatigue to
 which you have been subjected?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He declined the offer, however. "A thousand thanks, madame; a little milk,
 with bread and butter, will be best for me."
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment a door was smartly opened and Gilberte entered the room
 with outstretched hand. Delaherche must have told her who was there, for
 her ordinary hour of rising was ten o'clock. She was tall, lithe of form
 and well-proportioned, with an abundance of handsome black hair, a pair of
 handsome black eyes, and a very rosy, wholesome complexion withal; she had
 a laughing, rather free and easy way with her, and it did not seem
 possible she could ever look angry. Her peignoir of beige, embroidered
 with red silk, was evidently of Parisian manufacture.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, Captain," she rapidly said, shaking hands with the young man, "how
 nice of you to stop and see us, away up in this out-of-the-world place!"
 But she was the first to see that she had "put her foot in it" and laugh
 at her own blunder. "Oh, what a stupid thing I am! I might know you would
 rather be somewhere else than at Sedan, under the circumstances. But I am
 very glad to see you once more."
 </p>
 <p>
 She showed it; her face was bright and animated, while Madame Delaherche,
 who could not have failed to hear something of the gossip that had been
 current among the scandalmongers of Charleville, watched the pair closely
 with her puritanical air. The captain was very reserved in his behavior,
 however, manifesting nothing more than a pleasant recollection of
 hospitalities previously received in the house where he was visiting.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had no more than sat down at table than Delaherche, burning to
 relieve himself of the subject that filled his mind, commenced to relate
 his experiences of the day before.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You know I saw the Emperor at Baybel."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was fairly started and nothing could stop him. He began by describing
 the farmhouse, a large structure with an interior court, surrounded by an
 iron railing, and situated on a gentle eminence overlooking Mouzon, to the
 left of the Carignan road. Then he came back to the 12th corps, whom he
 had visited in their camp among the vines on the hillsides; splendid
 troops they were, with their equipments brightly shining in the sunlight,
 and the sight of them had caused his heart to beat with patriotic ardor.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And there I was, sir, when the Emperor, who had alighted to breakfast and
 rest himself a bit, came out of the farmhouse. He wore a general's uniform
 and carried an overcoat across his arm, although the sun was very hot. He
 was followed by a servant bearing a camp stool. He did not look to me like
 a well man; ah no, far from it; his stooping form, the sallowness of his
 complexion, the feebleness of his movements, all indicated him to be in a
 very bad way. I was not surprised, for the druggist at Mouzon, when he
 recommended me to drive on to Baybel, told me that an aide-de-camp had
 just been in his shop to get some medicine&mdash;you understand what I
 mean, medicine for&mdash;" The presence of his wife and mother prevented
 him from alluding more explicitly to the nature of the Emperor's
 complaint, which was an obstinate diarrhea that he had contracted at Chene
 and which compelled him to make those frequent halts at houses along the
 road. "Well, then, the attendant opened the camp stool and placed it in
 the shade of a clump of trees at the edge of a field of wheat, and the
 Emperor sat down on it. Sitting there in a limp, dejected attitude,
 perfectly still, he looked for all the world like a small shopkeeper
 taking a sun bath for his rheumatism. His dull eyes wandered over the wide
 horizon, the Meuse coursing through the valley at his feet, before him the
 range of wooded heights whose summits recede and are lost in the distance,
 on the left the waving tree-tops of Dieulet forest, on the right the
 verdure-clad eminence of Sommanthe. He was surrounded by his military
 family, aides and officers of rank, and a colonel of dragoons, who had
 already applied to me for information about the country, had just motioned
 me not to go away, when all at once&mdash;" Delaherche rose from his
 chair, for he had reached the point where the dramatic interest of his
 story culminated and it became necessary to re-enforce words by gestures.
 "All at once there is a succession of sharp reports and right in front of
 us, over the wood of Dieulet, shells are seen circling through the air. It
 produced on me no more effect than a display of fireworks in broad
 daylight, sir, upon my word it didn't! The people about the Emperor, of
 course, showed a good deal of agitation and uneasiness. The colonel of
 dragoons comes running up again to ask if I can give them an idea whence
 the firing proceeds. I answer him off-hand: 'It is at Beaumont; there is
 not the slightest doubt about it.' He returns to the Emperor, on whose
 knees an aide-de-camp was unfolding a map. The Emperor was evidently of
 opinion that the fighting was not at Beaumont, for he sent the colonel
 back to me a third time. But I couldn't well do otherwise than stick to
 what I had said before, could I, now? the more that the shells kept flying
 through the air, nearer and nearer, following the line of the Mouzon road.
 And then, sir, as sure as I see you standing there, I saw the Emperor turn
 his pale face toward me. Yes sir, he looked at me a moment with those dim
 eyes of his, that were filled with an expression of melancholy and
 distrust. And then his face declined upon his map again and he made no
 further movement."
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche, although he was an ardent Bonapartist at the time of the
 plebiscite, had admitted after our early defeats that the government was
 responsible for some mistakes, but he stood up for the dynasty,
 compassionating and excusing Napoleon III., deceived and betrayed as he
 was by everyone. It was his firm opinion that the men at whose door should
 be laid the responsibility for all our disasters were none other than
 those Republican deputies of the opposition who had stood in the way of
 voting the necessary men and money.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And did the Emperor return to the farmhouse?" asked Captain Beaudoin.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's more than I can say, my dear sir; I left him sitting on his stool.
 It was midday, the battle was drawing nearer, and it occurred to me that
 it was time to be thinking of my own return. All that I can tell you
 besides is that a general to whom I pointed out the position of Carignan
 in the distance, in the plain to our rear, appeared greatly surprised to
 learn that the Belgian frontier lay in that direction and was only a few
 miles away. Ah, that the poor Emperor should have to rely on such
 servants!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte, all smiles, was giving her attention to the captain and keeping
 him supplied with buttered toast, as much at ease as she had ever been in
 bygone days when she received him in her salon during her widowhood. She
 insisted that he should accept a bed with them, but he declined, and it
 was agreed that he should rest for an hour or two on a sofa in
 Delaherche's study before going out to find his regiment. As he was taking
 the sugar bowl from the young woman's hands old Madame Delaherche, who had
 kept her eye on them, distinctly saw him squeeze her fingers, and the old
 lady's suspicions were confirmed. At that moment a servant came to the
 door.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Monsieur, there is a soldier outside who wants to know the address of
 Monsieur Weiss."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was nothing "stuck-up" about Delaherche, people said; he was fond of
 popularity and was always delighted to have a chat with those of an
 inferior station.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He wants Weiss's address! that's odd. Bring the soldier in here."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean entered the room in such an exhausted state that he reeled as if he
 had been drunk. He started at seeing his captain seated at the table with
 two ladies, and involuntarily withdrew the hand that he had extended
 toward a chair in order to steady himself; he replied briefly to the
 questions of the manufacturer, who played his part of the soldier's friend
 with great cordiality. In a few words he explained his relation toward
 Maurice and the reason why he was looking for him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He is a corporal in my company," the captain finally said by way of
 cutting short the conversation, and inaugurated a series of questions on
 his own account to learn what had become of the regiment. As Jean went on
 to tell that the colonel had been seen crossing the city to reach his camp
 at the head of what few men were left him, Gilberte again thoughtlessly
 spoke up, with the vivacity of a woman whose beauty is supposed to atone
 for her indiscretion:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! he is my uncle; why does he not come and breakfast with us? We could
 fix up a room for him here. Can't we send someone for him?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the old lady discouraged the project with an authority there was no
 disputing. The good old bourgeois blood of the frontier towns flowed in
 her veins; her austerely patriotic sentiments were almost those of a man.
 She broke the stern silence that she had preserved during the meal by
 saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never mind Monsieur de Vineuil; he is doing his duty."
 </p>
 <p>
 Her short speech was productive of embarrassment among the party.
 Delaherche conducted the captain to his study, where he saw him safely
 bestowed upon the sofa; Gilberte moved lightly off about her business, no
 more disconcerted by her rebuff than is the bird that shakes its wings in
 gay defiance of the shower; while the handmaid to whom Jean had been
 intrusted led him by a very labyrinth of passages and staircases through
 the various departments of the factory.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Weiss family lived in the Rue des Voyards, but their house, which was
 Delaherche's property, communicated with the great structure in the Rue
 Maqua. The Rue des Voyards was at that time one of the most squalid
 streets in Sedan, being nothing more than a damp, narrow lane, its normal
 darkness intensified by the proximity of the ramparts, which ran parallel
 to it. The roofs of the tall houses almost met, the dark passages were
 like the mouths of caverns, and more particularly so at that end where
 rose the high college walls. Weiss, however, with free quarters and free
 fuel on his third floor, found the location a convenient one on account of
 its nearness to his office, to which he could descend in slippers without
 having to go around by the street. His life had been a happy one since his
 marriage with Henriette, so long the object of his hopes and wishes since
 first he came to know her at Chene, filling her dead mother's place when
 only six years old and keeping the house for her father, the
 tax-collector; while he, entering the big refinery almost on the footing
 of a laborer, was picking up an education as best he could, and fitting
 himself for the accountant's position which was the reward of his
 unremitting toil. And even when he had attained to that measure of success
 his dream was not to be realized; not until the father had been removed by
 death, not until the brother at Paris had been guilty of those excesses:
 that brother Maurice to whom his twin sister had in some sort made herself
 a servant, to whom she had sacrificed her little all to make him a
 gentleman&mdash;not until then was Henriette to be his wife. She had never
 been aught more than a little drudge at home; she could barely read and
 write; she had sold house, furniture, all she had, to pay the young man's
 debts, when good, kind Weiss came to her with the offer of his savings,
 together with his heart and his two strong arms; and she had accepted him
 with grateful tears, bringing him in return for his devotion a steadfast,
 virtuous affection, replete with tender esteem, if not the stormier ardors
 of a passionate love. Fortune had smiled on them; Delaherche had spoken of
 giving Weiss an interest in the business, and when children should come to
 bless their union their felicity would be complete.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look out!" the servant said to Jean; "the stairs are steep."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was stumbling upward as well as the intense darkness of the place would
 let him, when suddenly a door above was thrown open, a broad belt of light
 streamed out across the landing, and he heard a soft voice saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is he."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Madame Weiss," cried the servant, "here is a soldier who has been
 inquiring for you."
 </p>
 <p>
 There came the sound of a low, pleased laugh, and the same soft voice
 replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good! good! I know who it is." Then to the corporal, who was hesitating,
 rather diffidently, on the landing: "Come in, Monsieur Jean. Maurice has
 been here nearly two hours, and we have been wondering what detained you."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, in the pale sunlight that filled the room, he saw how like she was
 to Maurice, with that wonderful resemblance that often makes twins so like
 each other as to be indistinguishable. She was smaller and slighter than
 he, however; more fragile in appearance, with a rather large mouth and
 delicately molded features, surmounted by an opulence of the most
 beautiful hair imaginable, of the golden yellow of ripened grain. The
 feature where she least resembled him was her gray eyes, great calm, brave
 orbs, instinct with the spirit of the grandfather, the hero of the Grand
 Army. She used few words, was noiseless in her movements, and was so
 gentle, so cheerful, so helpfully active that where she passed her
 presence seemed to linger in the air, like a fragrant caress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come this way, Monsieur Jean," she said. "Everything will soon be ready
 for you."
 </p>
 <p>
 He stammered something inarticulately, for his emotion was such that he
 could find no word of thanks. In addition to that his eyes were closing he
 beheld her through the irresistible drowsiness that was settling on him as
 a sea-fog drifts in and settles on the land, in which she seemed floating
 in a vague, unreal way, as if her feet no longer touched the earth. Could
 it be that it was all a delightful apparition, that friendly young woman
 who smiled on him with such sweet simplicity? He fancied for a moment that
 she had touched his hand and that he had felt the pressure of hers, cool
 and firm, loyal as the clasp of an old tried friend.
 </p>
 <p>
 That was the last moment in which Jean was distinctly conscious of what
 was going on about him. They were in the dining room; bread and meat were
 set out on the table, but for the life of him he could not have raised a
 morsel to his lips. A man was there, seated on a chair. Presently he knew
 it was Weiss, whom he had seen at Mulhausen, but he had no idea what the
 man was saying with such a sober, sorrowful air, with slow and emphatic
 gestures. Maurice was already sound asleep, with the tranquillity of death
 resting on his face, on a bed that had been improvised for him beside the
 stove, and Henriette was busying herself about a sofa on which a mattress
 had been thrown; she brought in a bolster, pillow and coverings; with
 nimble, dexterous hands she spread the white sheets, snowy white, dazzling
 in their whiteness.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah! those clean, white sheets, so long coveted, so ardently desired; Jean
 had eyes for naught save them. For six weeks he had not had his clothes
 off, had not slept in a bed. He was as impatient as a child waiting for
 some promised treat, or a lover expectant of his mistress's coming; the
 time seemed long, terribly long to him, until he could plunge into those
 cool, white depths and lose himself there. Quickly, as soon as he was
 alone, he removed his shoes and tossed his uniform across a chair, then,
 with a deep sigh of satisfaction, threw himself on the bed. He opened his
 eyes a little way for a last look about him before his final plunge into
 unconsciousness, and in the pale morning light that streamed in through
 the lofty window beheld a repetition of his former pleasant vision, only
 fainter, more aerial; a vision of Henriette entering the room on tiptoe,
 and placing on the table at his side a water-jug and glass that had been
 forgotten before. She seemed to linger there a moment, looking at the
 sleeping pair, him and her brother, with her tranquil, ineffably tender
 smile upon her lips, then faded into air, and he, between his white
 sheets, was as if he were not.
 </p>
 <p>
 Hours&mdash;or was it years? slipped by; Jean and Maurice were like dead
 men, without a dream, without consciousness of the life that was within
 them. Whether it was ten years or ten minutes, time had stood still for
 them; the overtaxed body had risen against its oppressor and annihilated
 their every faculty. They awoke simultaneously with a great start and
 looked at each other inquiringly; where were they? what had happened? how
 long had they slept? The same pale light was entering through the tall
 window. They felt as if they had been racked; joints stiffer, limbs
 wearier, mouth more hot and dry than when they had lain down; they could
 not have slept more than an hour, fortunately. It did not surprise them to
 see Weiss sitting where they had seen him before, in the same dejected
 attitude, apparently waiting for them to awake.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Fichtre</i>!" exclaimed Jean, "we must get up and report ourselves to
 the first sergeant before noon."
 </p>
 <p>
 He uttered a smothered cry of pain as he jumped to the floor and began to
 dress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Before noon!" said Weiss. "Are you aware that it is seven o'clock in the
 evening? You have slept about twelve hours."
 </p>
 <p>
 Great heavens, seven o'clock! They were thunderstruck. Jean, who by that
 time was completely dressed, would have run for it, but Maurice, still in
 bed, found he no longer had control of his legs; how were they ever to
 find their comrades? would not the army have marched away? They took Weiss
 to task for having let them sleep so long. But the accountant shook his
 head sorrowfully and said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You have done just as well to remain in bed, for all that has been
 accomplished."
 </p>
 <p>
 All that day, from early morning, he had been scouring Sedan and its
 environs in quest of news, and was just come in, discouraged with the
 inactivity of the troops and the inexplicable delay that had lost them the
 whole of that precious day, the 31st. The sole excuse was that the men
 were worn out and rest was an absolute necessity for them, but granting
 that, he could not see why the retreat should not have been continued
 after giving them a few hours of repose.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I do not pretend to be a judge of such matters," he continued, "but I
 have a feeling, so strong as to be almost a conviction, that the army is
 very badly situated at Sedan. The 12th corps is at Bazeilles, where there
 was a little fighting this morning; the 1st is strung out along the
 Givonne between la Moncelle and Holly, while the 7th is encamped on the
 plateau of Floing, and the 5th, what is left of it, is crowded together
 under the ramparts of the city, on the side of the Chateau. And that is
 what alarms me, to see them all concentrated thus about the city, waiting
 for the coming of the Prussians. If I were in command I would retreat on
 Mezieres, and lose no time about it, either. I know the country; it is the
 only line of retreat that is open to us, and if we take any other course
 we shall be driven into Belgium. Come here! let me show you something."
 </p>
 <p>
 He took Jean by the hand and led him to the window.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Tell me what you see over yonder on the crest of the hills."
 </p>
 <p>
 Looking from the window over the ramparts, over the adjacent buildings,
 their view embraced the valley of the Meuse to the southward of Sedan.
 There was the river, winding through broad meadows; there, to the left,
 was Remilly in the background, Pont Maugis and Wadelincourt before them
 and Frenois to the right; and shutting in the landscape the ranges of
 verdant hills, Liry first, then la Marfee and la Croix Piau, with their
 dense forests. A deep tranquillity, a crystalline clearness reigned over
 the wide prospect that lay there in the mellow light of the declining day.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you see that moving line of black upon the hilltops, that procession
 of small black ants?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean stared in amazement, while Maurice, kneeling on his bed, craned his
 neck to see.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes!" they cried. "There is a line, there is another, and another,
 and another! They are everywhere."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well," continued Weiss, "those are Prussians. I have been watching them
 since morning, and they have been coming, coming, as if there were no end
 to them! You may be sure of one thing: if our troops are waiting for them,
 they have no intention of disappointing us. And not I alone, but every
 soul in the city saw them; it is only the generals who persist in being
 blind. I was talking with a general officer a little while ago; he
 shrugged his shoulders and told me that Marshal MacMahon was absolutely
 certain that he had not over seventy thousand men in his front. God grant
 he may be right! But look and see for yourselves; the ground is hid by
 them! they keep coming, ever coming, the black swarm!"
 </p>
 <p>
 At this juncture Maurice threw himself back in his bed and gave way to a
 violent fit of sobbing. Henriette came in, a smile on her face. She
 hastened to him in alarm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But he pushed her away. "No, no! leave me, have nothing more to do with
 me; I have never been anything but a burden to you. When I think that you
 were making yourself a drudge, a slave, while I was attending college&mdash;oh!
 to what miserable use have I turned that education! And I was near
 bringing dishonor on our name; I shudder to think where I might be now,
 had you not beggared yourself to pay for my extravagance and folly."
 </p>
 <p>
 Her smile came back to her face, together with her serenity.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is that all? Your sleep don't seem to have done you good, my poor friend.
 But since that is all gone and past, forget it! Are you not doing your
 duty now, like a good Frenchman? I am very proud of you, I assure you, now
 that you are a soldier."
 </p>
 <p>
 She had turned toward Jean, as if to ask him to come to her assistance,
 and he looked at her with some surprise that she appeared to him less
 beautiful than yesterday; she was paler, thinner, now that the glamour was
 no longer in his drowsy eyes. The one striking point that remained
 unchanged was her resemblance to her brother, and yet the difference in
 their two natures was never more strongly marked than at that moment; he,
 weak and nervous as a woman, swayed by the impulse of the hour, displaying
 in his person all the fitful and emotional temperament of his nation,
 vibrating from one moment to another between the loftiest enthusiasm and
 the most abject despair; she, the patient, indomitable housewife, such an
 inconsiderable little creature in her resignation and self-effacement,
 meeting adversity with a brave face and eyes full of inexpugnable courage
 and resolution, fashioned from the stuff of which heroes are made.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Proud of me!" cried Maurice. "Ah! truly, you have great reason to be. For
 a month and more now we have been flying, like the cowards that we are!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "What of it? we are not the only ones," said Jean with his practical
 common sense; "we do what we are told to do."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the young man broke out more furiously than ever: "I have had enough
 of it, I tell you! Our imbecile leaders, our continual defeats, our brave
 soldiers led like sheep to the slaughter&mdash;is it not enough, seeing
 all these things, to make one weep tears of blood? We are here now in
 Sedan, caught in a trap from which there is no escape; you can see the
 Prussians closing in on us from every quarter, and certain destruction is
 staring us in the face; there is no hope, the end is come. No! I shall
 remain where I am; I may as well be shot as a deserter. Jean, do you go,
 and leave me here. No! I won't go back there; I will stay here."
 </p>
 <p>
 He sank upon the pillow in a renewed outpour of tears. It was an utter
 breakdown of the nervous system, sweeping everything before it, one of
 those sudden lapses into hopelessness to which he was so subject, in which
 he despised himself and all the world. His sister, knowing as she did the
 best way of treating such crises, kept an unruffled face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That would not be a nice thing to do, dear Maurice&mdash;desert your post
 in the hour of danger."
 </p>
 <p>
 He rose impetuously to a sitting posture: "Then give me my musket! I will
 go and blow my brains out; that will be the shortest way of ending it."
 Then, pointing with outstretched arm to Weiss, where he sat silent and
 motionless, he said: "There! that is the only sensible man I have seen;
 yes, he is the only one who saw things as they were. You remember what he
 said to me, Jean, at Mulhausen, a month ago?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is true," the corporal assented; "the gentleman said we should be
 beaten."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the scene rose again before their mind's eye, that night of anxious
 vigil, the agonized suspense, the prescience of the disaster at
 Froeschwiller hanging in the sultry heavy air, while the Alsatian told his
 prophetic fears; Germany in readiness, with the best of arms and the best
 of leaders, rising to a man in a grand outburst of patriotism; France
 dazed, a century behind the age, debauched, and a prey to intestine
 disorder, having neither commanders, men, nor arms to enable her to cope
 with her powerful adversary. How quickly the horrible prediction had
 proved itself true!
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss raised his trembling hands. Profound sorrow was depicted on his
 kind, honest face, with its red hair and beard and its great prominent
 blue eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" he murmured, "I take no credit to myself for being right. I don't
 claim to be wiser than others, but it was all so clear, when one only knew
 the true condition of affairs! But if we are to be beaten we shall first
 have the pleasure of killing some of those Prussians of perdition. There
 is that comfort for us; I believe that many of us are to leave their bones
 there, and I hope there will be plenty of Prussians to keep them company;
 I would like to see the ground down there in the valley heaped with dead
 Prussians!" He arose and pointed down the valley of the Meuse. Fire
 flashed from his myopic eyes, which had exempted him from service with the
 army. "A thousand thunders! I would fight, yes, I would, if they would
 have me. I don't know whether it is seeing them assume the airs of masters
 in my country&mdash;in this country where once the Cossacks did such
 mischief; but whenever I think of their being here, of their entering our
 houses, I am seized with an uncontrollable desire to cut a dozen of their
 throats. Ah! if it were not for my eyes, if they would take me, I would
 go!" Then, after a moment's silence: "And besides; who can tell?"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the hope that sprang eternal, even in the breast of the least
 confident, of the possibility of victory, and Maurice, ashamed by this
 time of his tears, listened and caught at the pleasing speculation. Was it
 not true that only the day before there had been a rumor that Bazaine was
 at Verdun? Truly, it was time that Fortune should work a miracle for that
 France whose glories she had so long protected. Henriette, with an
 imperceptible smile on her lips, silently left the room, and was not the
 least bit surprised when she returned to find her brother up and dressed,
 and ready to go back to his duty. She insisted, however, that he and Jean
 should take some nourishment first. They seated themselves at the table,
 but the morsels choked them; their stomachs, weakened by their heavy
 slumber, revolted at the food. Like a prudent old campaigner Jean cut a
 loaf in two halves and placed one in Maurice's sack, the other in his own.
 It was growing dark, it behooved them to be going. Henriette, who was
 standing at the window watching the Prussian troops incessantly defiling
 on distant la Marfee, the swarming legions of black ants that were
 gradually being swallowed up in the gathering shadows, involuntarily
 murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, war! what a dreadful thing it is!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, seeing an opportunity to retort her sermon to him, immediately
 took her up:
 </p>
 <p>
 "How is this, little sister? you are anxious to have people fight, and you
 speak disrespectfully of war!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She turned and faced him, valiantly as ever: "It is true; I abhor it,
 because it is an abomination and an injustice. It may be simply because I
 am a woman, but the thought of such butchery sickens me. Why cannot
 nations adjust their differences without shedding blood?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, the good fellow, seconded her with a nod of the head, and nothing to
 him, too, seemed easier&mdash;to him, the unlettered man&mdash;than to
 come together and settle matters after a fair, honest talk; but Maurice,
 mindful of his scientific theories, reflected on the necessity of war&mdash;war,
 which is itself existence, the universal law. Was it not poor, pitiful man
 who conceived the idea of justice and peace, while impassive nature revels
 in continual slaughter?
 </p>
 <p>
 "That is all very fine!" he cried. "Yes, centuries hence, if it shall come
 to pass that then all the nations shall be merged in one; centuries hence
 man may look forward to the coming of that golden age; and even in that
 case would not the end of war be the end of humanity? I was a fool but
 now; we must go and fight, since it is nature's law." He smiled and
 repeated his brother-in-law's expression: "And besides, who can tell?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He saw things now through the mirage of his vivid self-delusion, they came
 to his vision distorted through the lens of his diseased nervous
 sensibility.
 </p>
 <p>
 "By the way," he continued cheerfully, "what do you hear of our cousin
 Gunther? You know we have not seen a German yet, so you can't look to me
 to give you any foreign news."
 </p>
 <p>
 The question was addressed to his brother-in-law, who had relapsed into a
 thoughtful silence and answered by a motion of his hand, expressive of his
 ignorance.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Cousin Gunther?" said Henriette, "Why, he belongs to the Vth corps and is
 with the Crown Prince's army; I read it in one of the newspapers, I don't
 remember which. Is that army in this neighborhood?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss repeated his gesture, which was imitated by the two soldiers, who
 could not be supposed to know what enemies were in front of them when
 their generals did not know. Rising to his feet, the master of the house
 at last made use of articulate speech.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come along; I will go with you. I learned this afternoon where the
 106th's camp is situated." He told his wife that she need not expect to
 see him again that night, as he would sleep at Bazeilles, where they had
 recently bought and furnished a little place to serve them as a residence
 during the hot months. It was near a dyehouse that belonged to M.
 Delaherche. The accountant's mind was ill at ease in relation to certain
 stores that he had placed in the cellar&mdash;a cask of wine and a couple
 of sacks of potatoes; the house would certainly be visited by marauders if
 it was left unprotected, he said, while by occupying it that night he
 would doubtless save it from pillage. His wife watched him closely while
 he was speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You need not be alarmed," he added, with a smile; "I harbor no darker
 design than the protection of our property, and I pledge my word that if
 the village is attacked, or if there is any appearance of danger, I will
 come home at once."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, then, go," she said. "But remember, if you are not back in good
 season you will see me out there looking for you."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette went with them to the door, where she embraced Maurice tenderly
 and gave Jean a warm clasp of the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I intrust my brother to your care once more. He has told me of your
 kindness to him, and I love you for it."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was too flustered to do more than return the pressure of the small,
 firm hand. His first impression returned to him again, and he beheld
 Henriette in the light in which she had first appeared to him, with her
 bright hair of the hue of ripe golden grain, so alert, so sunny, so
 unselfish, that her presence seemed to pervade the air like a caress.
 </p>
 <p>
 Once they were outside they found the same gloomy and forbidding Sedan
 that had greeted their eyes that morning. Twilight with its shadows had
 invaded the narrow streets, sidewalk and carriage-way alike were filled
 with a confused, surging throng. Most of the shops were closed, the houses
 seemed to be dead or sleeping, while out of doors the crowd was so dense
 that men trod on one another. With some little difficulty, however, they
 succeeded in reaching the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, where they
 encountered M. Delaherche, intent on picking up the latest news and seeing
 what was to be seen. He at once came up and greeted them, apparently
 delighted to meet Maurice, to whom he said that he had just returned from
 accompanying Captain Beaudoin over to Floing, where the regiment was
 posted, and he became, if that were possible, even more gracious than ever
 upon learning that Weiss proposed to pass the night at Bazeilles, where he
 himself, he declared, had just been telling the captain that he intended
 to take a bed, in order to see how things were looking at the dyehouse.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We'll go together and be company for each other, Weiss. But first let's
 go as far as the Sous-Prefecture; we may be able to catch a glimpse of the
 Emperor."
 </p>
 <p>
 Ever since he had been so near having the famous conversation with him at
 Baybel his mind had been full of Napoleon III.; he was not satisfied until
 he had induced the two soldiers to accompany him. The Place de la
 Sous-Prefecture was comparatively empty; a few men were standing about in
 groups, engaged in whispered conversation, while occasionally an officer
 hurried by, haggard and careworn. The bright hues of the foliage were
 beginning to fade and grow dim in the melancholy, thick-gathering shades
 of night; the hoarse murmur of the Meuse was heard as its current poured
 onward beneath the houses to the right. Among the whisperers it was
 related how the Emperor&mdash;who with the greatest difficulty had been
 prevailed on to leave Carignan the night before about eleven o'clock&mdash;when
 entreated to push on to Mezieres had refused point-blank to abandon the
 post of danger and take a step that would prove so demoralizing to the
 troops. Others asserted that he was no longer in the city, that he had
 fled, leaving behind him a dummy emperor, one of his officers dressed in
 his uniform, a man whose startling resemblance to his imperial master had
 often puzzled the army. Others again declared, and called upon their honor
 to substantiate their story, that they had seen the army wagons containing
 the imperial treasure, one hundred millions, all in brand-new twenty-franc
 pieces, drive into the courtyard of the Prefecture. This convoy was, in
 fact, neither more nor less than the vehicles for the personal use of the
 Emperor and his suite, the <i>char a banc</i>, the two <i>caleches</i>,
 the twelve baggage and supply wagons, which had almost excited a riot in
 the villages through which they had passed&mdash;Courcelles, le Chene,
 Raucourt; assuming in men's imagination the dimensions of a huge train
 that had blocked the road and arrested the march of armies, and which now,
 shorn of their glory, execrated by all, had come in shame and disgrace to
 hide themselves among the sous-prefect's lilac bushes.
 </p>
 <p>
 While Delaherche was raising himself on tiptoe and trying to peer through
 the windows of the <i>rez-de-chaussee</i>, an old woman at his side, some
 poor day-worker of the neighborhood, with shapeless form and hands
 calloused and distorted by many years of toil, was mumbling between her
 teeth:
 </p>
 <p>
 "An emperor&mdash;I should like to see one once&mdash;just once&mdash;so I
 could say I had seen him."
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly Delaherche exclaimed, seizing Maurice by the arm:
 </p>
 <p>
 "See, there he is! at the window, to the left. I had a good view of him
 yesterday; I can't be mistaken. There, he has just raised the curtain;
 see, that pale face, close to the glass."
 </p>
 <p>
 The old woman had overheard him and stood staring with wide-open mouth and
 eyes, for there, full in the window, was an apparition that resembled a
 corpse more than a living being; its eyes were lifeless, its features
 distorted; even the mustache had assumed a ghastly whiteness in that final
 agony. The old woman was dumfounded; forthwith she turned her back and
 marched off with a look of supreme contempt.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That thing an emperor! a likely story."
 </p>
 <p>
 A zouave was standing near, one of those fugitive soldiers who were in no
 haste to rejoin their commands. Brandishing his chassepot and
 expectorating threats and maledictions, he said to his companion:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wait! see me put a bullet in his head!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche remonstrated angrily, but by that time the Emperor had
 disappeared. The hoarse murmur of the Meuse continued uninterruptedly; a
 wailing lament, inexpressibly mournful, seemed to pass above them through
 the air, where the darkness was gathering intensity. Other sounds rose in
 the distance, like the hollow muttering of the rising storm; were they the
 "March! march!" that terrible order from Paris that had driven that
 ill-starred man onward day by day, dragging behind him along the roads of
 his defeat the irony of his imperial escort, until now he was brought face
 to face with the ruin he had foreseen and come forth to meet? What
 multitudes of brave men were to lay down their lives for his mistakes, and
 how complete the wreck, in all his being, of that sick man, that
 sentimental dreamer, awaiting in gloomy silence the fulfillment of his
 destiny!
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss and Delaherche accompanied the two soldiers to the plateau of
 Floing, where the 7th corps camps were.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Adieu!" said Maurice as he embraced his brother-in-law.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; not adieu, the deuce! Au <i>revoir</i>!" the manufacturer gayly
 cried.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's instinct led him at once to their regiment, the tents of which were
 pitched behind the cemetery, where the ground of the plateau begins to
 fall away. It was nearly dark, but there was sufficient light yet
 remaining in the sky to enable them to distinguish the black huddle of
 roofs above the city, and further in the distance Balan and Bazeilles,
 lying in the broad meadows that stretch away to the range of hills between
 Remilly and Frenois, while to the right was the dusky wood of la Garenne,
 and to the left the broad bosom of the Meuse had the dull gleam of frosted
 silver in the dying daylight. Maurice surveyed the broad landscape that
 was momentarily fading in the descending shadows.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, here is the corporal!" said Chouteau. "I wonder if he has been
 looking after our rations!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The camp was astir with life and bustle. All day the men had been coming
 in, singly and in little groups, and the crowd and confusion were such
 that the officers made no pretense of punishing or even reprimanding them;
 they accepted thankfully those who were so kind as to return and asked no
 questions. Captain Beaudoin had made his appearance only a short time
 before, and it was about two o'clock when Lieutenant Rochas had brought in
 his collection of stragglers, about one-third of the company strength. Now
 the ranks were nearly full once more. Some of the men were drunk, others
 had not been able to secure even a morsel of bread and were sinking from
 inanition; again there had been no distribution of rations. Loubet,
 however, had discovered some cabbages in a neighboring garden, and cooked
 them after a fashion, but there was no salt or lard; the empty stomachs
 continued to assert their claims.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, now, corporal, you are a knowing old file," Chouteau tauntingly
 continued, "what have you got for us? Oh, it's not for myself I care;
 Loubet and I had a good breakfast; a lady gave it us. You were not at
 distribution, then?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean beheld a circle of expectant eyes bent on him; the squad had been
 waiting for him with anxiety, Pache and Lapoulle in particular, luckless
 dogs, who had found nothing they could appropriate; they all relied on
 him, who, as they expressed it, could get bread out of a stone. And the
 corporal's conscience smote him for having abandoned his men; he took pity
 on them and divided among them half the bread that he had in his sack.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Name o' God! Name o' God!" grunted Lapoulle as he contentedly munched the
 dry bread; it was all he could find to say; while Pache repeated a <i>Pater</i>
 and an <i>Ave</i> under his breath to make sure that Heaven should not
 forget to send him his breakfast in the morning.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gaude, the bugler, with his darkly mysterious air, as of a man who has had
 troubles of which he does not care to speak, sounded the call for evening
 muster with a glorious fanfare; but there was no necessity for sounding
 taps that night, the camp was immediately enveloped in profound silence.
 And when he had verified the names and seen that none of his half-section
 were missing, Sergeant Sapin, with his thin, sickly face and his pinched
 nose, softly said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "There will be one less to-morrow night."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, as he saw Jean looking at him inquiringly, he added with calm
 conviction, his eyes bent upon the blackness of the night, as if reading
 there the destiny that he predicted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It will be mine; I shall be killed to-morrow."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was nine o'clock, with promise of a chilly, uncomfortable night, for a
 dense mist had risen from the surface of the river, so that the stars were
 no longer visible. Maurice shivered, where he lay with Jean beneath a
 hedge, and said they would do better to go and seek the shelter of the
 tent; the rest they had taken that day had left them wakeful, their joints
 seemed stiffer and their bones sorer than before; neither could sleep.
 They envied Lieutenant Rochas, who, stretched on the damp ground and
 wrapped in his blanket, was snoring like a trooper, not far away. For a
 long time after that they watched with interest the feeble light of a
 candle that was burning in a large tent where the colonel and some
 officers were in consultation. All that evening M. de Vineuil had
 manifested great uneasiness that he had received no instructions to guide
 him in the morning. He felt that his regiment was too much "in the air,"
 too much advanced, although it had already fallen back from the exposed
 position that it had occupied earlier in the day. Nothing had been seen of
 General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who was said to be ill in bed at the Hotel
 of the Golden Cross, and the colonel decided to send one of his officers
 to advise him of the danger of their new position in the too extended line
 of the 7th corps, which had to cover the long stretch from the bend in the
 Meuse to the wood of la Garenne. There could be no doubt that the enemy
 would attack with the first glimpse of daylight; only for seven or eight
 hours now would that deep tranquillity remain unbroken. And shortly after
 the dim light in the colonel's tent was extinguished Maurice was amazed to
 see Captain Beaudoin glide by, keeping close to the hedge, with furtive
 steps, and vanish in the direction of Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 The darkness settled down on them, denser and denser; the chill mists rose
 from the stream and enshrouded everything in a dank, noisome fog.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you asleep, Jean?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was asleep, and Maurice was alone. He could not endure the thought of
 going to the tent where Lapoulle and the rest of them were slumbering; he
 heard their snoring, responsive to Rochas' strains, and envied them. If
 our great captains sleep soundly the night before a battle, it is like
 enough for the reason that their fatigue will not let them do otherwise.
 He was conscious of no sound save the equal, deep-drawn breathing of that
 slumbering multitude, rising from the darkening camp like the gentle
 respiration of some huge monster; beyond that all was void. He only knew
 that the 5th corps was close at hand, encamped beneath the rampart, that
 the 1st's line extended from the wood of la Garenne to la Moncelle, while
 the 12th was posted on the other side of the city, at Bazeilles; and all
 were sleeping; the whole length of that long line, from the nearest tent
 to the most remote, for miles and miles, that low, faint murmur ascended
 in rhythmic unison from the dark, mysterious bosom of the night. Then
 outside this circle lay another region, the realm of the unknown, whence
 also sounds came intermittently to his ears, so vague, so distant, that he
 scarcely knew whether they were not the throbbings of his own excited
 pulses; the indistinct trot of cavalry plashing over the low ground, the
 dull rumble of gun and caisson along the roads, and, still more marked,
 the heavy tramp of marching men; the gathering on the heights above of
 that black swarm, engaged in strengthening the meshes of their net, from
 which night itself had not served to divert them. And below, there by the
 river's side, was there not the flash of lights suddenly extinguished, was
 not that the sound of hoarse voices shouting orders, adding to the dread
 suspense of that long night of terror while waiting for the coming of the
 dawn?
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice put forth his hand and felt for Jean's; at last he slumbered,
 comforted by the sense of human companionship. From a steeple in Sedan
 came the deep tones of a bell, slowly, mournfully, tolling the hour; then
 all was blank and void.

 <p>
 Weiss, in the obscurity of his little room at Bazeilles, was aroused by a
 commotion that caused him to leap from his bed. It was the roar of
 artillery. Groping about in the darkness he found and lit a candle to
 enable him to consult his watch: it was four o'clock, just beginning to be
 light. He adjusted his double eyeglass upon his nose and looked out into
 the main street of the village, the road that leads to Douzy, but it was
 filled with a thick cloud of something that resembled dust, which made it
 impossible to distinguish anything. He passed into the other room, the
 windows of which commanded a view of the Meuse and the intervening
 meadows, and saw that the cause of his obstructed vision was the morning
 mist arising from the river. In the distance, behind the veil of fog, the
 guns were barking more fiercely across the stream. All at once a French
 battery, close at hand, opened in reply, with such a tremendous crash that
 the walls of the little house were shaken.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss's house was situated near the middle of the village, on the right of
 the road and not far from the Place de l'Eglise. Its front, standing back
 a little from the street, displayed a single story with three windows,
 surmounted by an attic; in the rear was a garden of some extent that
 sloped gently downward toward the meadows and commanded a wide panoramic
 view of the encircling hills, from Remilly to Frenois. Weiss, with the
 sense of responsibility of his new proprietorship strong upon him, had
 spent the night in burying his provisions in the cellar and protecting his
 furniture, as far as possible, against shot and shell by applying
 mattresses to the windows, so that it was nearly two o'clock before he got
 to bed. His blood boiled at the idea that the Prussians might come and
 plunder the house, for which he had toiled so long and which had as yet
 afforded him so little enjoyment.
 </p>
 <p>
 He heard a voice summoning him from the street.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I say, Weiss, are you awake?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He descended and found it was Delaherche, who had passed the night at his
 dyehouse, a large brick structure, next door to the accountant's abode.
 The operatives had all fled, taking to the woods and making for the
 Belgian frontier, and there was no one left to guard the property but the
 woman concierge, Francoise Quittard by name, the widow of a mason; and she
 also, beside herself with terror, would have gone with the others had it
 not been for her ten-year-old boy Charles, who was so ill with typhoid
 fever that he could not be moved.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I say," Delaherche continued, "do you hear that? It is a promising
 beginning. Our best course is to get back to Sedan as soon as possible."
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss's promise to his wife, that he would leave Bazeilles at the first
 sign of danger, had been given in perfect good faith, and he had fully
 intended to keep it; but as yet there was only an artillery duel at long
 range, and the aim could not be accurate enough to do much damage in the
 uncertain, misty light of early morning.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wait a bit, confound it!" he replied. "There is no hurry."
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche, too, was curious to see what would happen; his curiosity made
 him valiant. He had been so interested in the preparations for defending
 the place that he had not slept a wink. General Lebrun, commanding the
 12th corps, had received notice that he would be attacked at daybreak, and
 had kept his men occupied during the night in strengthening the defenses
 of Bazeilles, which he had instructions to hold in spite of everything.
 Barricades had been thrown up across the Douzy road, and all the smaller
 streets; small parties of soldiers had been thrown into the houses by way
 of garrison; every narrow lane, every garden had become a fortress, and
 since three o'clock the troops, awakened from their slumbers without beat
 of drum or call of bugle in the inky blackness, had been at their posts,
 their chassepots freshly greased and cartridge boxes filled with the
 obligatory ninety rounds of ammunition. It followed that when the enemy
 opened their fire no one was taken unprepared, and the French batteries,
 posted to the rear between Balan and Bazeilles, immediately commenced to
 answer, rather with the idea of showing they were awake than for any other
 purpose, for in the dense fog that enveloped everything the practice was
 of the wildest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The dyehouse will be well defended," said Delaherche. "I have a whole
 section in it. Come and see."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true; forty and odd men of the infanterie de marine had been posted
 there under the command of a lieutenant, a tall, light-haired young
 fellow, scarcely more than a boy, but with an expression of energy and
 determination on his face. His men had already taken full possession of
 the building, some of them being engaged in loopholing the shutters of the
 ground-floor windows that commanded the street, while others, in the
 courtyard that overlooked the meadows in the rear, were breaching the wall
 for musketry. It was in this courtyard that Delaherche and Weiss found the
 young officer, straining his eyes to discover what was hidden behind the
 impenetrable mist.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Confound this fog!" he murmured. "We can't fight when we don't know where
 the enemy is." Presently he asked, with no apparent change of voice or
 manner: "What day of the week is this?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thursday," Weiss replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thursday, that's so. Hanged if I don't think the world might come to an
 end and we not know it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But just at that moment the uninterrupted roar of the artillery was
 diversified by a brisk rattle of musketry proceeding from the edge of the
 meadows, at a distance of two or three hundred yards. And at the same time
 there was a transformation, as rapid and startling, almost, as the stage
 effect in a fairy spectacle: the sun rose, the exhalations of the Meuse
 were whirled away like bits of finest, filmiest gauze, and the blue sky
 was revealed, in serene limpidity, undimmed by a single cloud. It was the
 exquisite morning of a faultless summer day.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" exclaimed Delaherche, "they are crossing the railway bridge. See,
 they are making their way along the track. How stupid of us not to have
 blown up the bridge!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The officer's face bore an expression of dumb rage. The mines had been
 prepared and charged, he averred, but they had fought four hours the day
 before to regain possession of the bridge and then had forgot to touch
 them off.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is just our luck," he curtly said.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss was silent, watching the course of events and endeavoring to form
 some idea of the true state of affairs. The position of the French in
 Bazeilles was a very strong one. The village commanded the meadows, and
 was bisected by the Douzy road, which, turning sharp to the left, passed
 under the walls of the Chateau, while another road, the one that led to
 the railway bridge, bent around to the right and forked at the Place de
 l'Eglise. There was no cover for any force advancing by these two
 approaches; the Germans would be obliged to traverse the meadows and the
 wide, bare level that lay between the outskirts of the village and the
 Meuse and the railway. Their prudence in avoiding unnecessary risks was
 notorious, hence it seemed improbable that the real attack would come from
 that quarter. They kept coming across the bridge, however, in deep masses,
 and that notwithstanding the slaughter that a battery of mitrailleuses,
 posted at the edge of the village, effected in their ranks, and all at
 once those who had crossed rushed forward in open order, under cover of
 the straggling willows, the columns were re-formed and began to advance.
 It was from there that the musketry fire, which was growing hotter, had
 proceeded.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, those are Bavarians," Weiss remarked. "I recognize them by the braid
 on their helmets."
 </p>
 <p>
 But there were other columns, moving to the right and partially concealed
 by the railway embankment, whose object, it seemed to him, was to gain the
 cover of some trees in the distance, whence they might descend and take
 Bazeilles in flank and rear. Should they succeed in effecting a lodgment
 in the park of Montivilliers, the village might become untenable. This was
 no more than a vague, half-formed idea, that flitted through his mind for
 a moment and faded as rapidly as it had come; the attack in front was
 becoming more determined, and his every faculty was concentrated on the
 struggle that was assuming, with every moment, larger dimensions.
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly he turned his head and looked away to the north, over the city of
 Sedan, where the heights of Floing were visible in the distance. A battery
 had just commenced firing from that quarter; the smoke rose in the bright
 sunshine in little curls and wreaths, and the reports came to his ears
 very distinctly. It was in the neighborhood of five o'clock.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, well," he murmured, "they are all going to have a hand in the
 business, it seems."
 </p>
 <p>
 The lieutenant of marines, who had turned his eyes in the same direction,
 spoke up confidently:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! Bazeilles is the key of the position. This is the spot where the
 battle will be won or lost."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you think so?" Weiss exclaimed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There is not the slightest doubt of it. It is certainly the marshal's
 opinion, for he was here last night and told us that we must hold the
 village if it cost the life of every man of us."
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss slowly shook his head, and swept the horizon with a glance; then in
 a low, faltering voice, as if speaking to himself, he said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No&mdash;no! I am sure that is a mistake. I fear the danger lies in
 another quarter&mdash;where, or what it is, I dare not say&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 He said no more. He simply opened wide his arms, like the jaws of a vise,
 then, turning to the north, brought his hands together, as if the vise had
 closed suddenly upon some object there.
 </p>
 <p>
 This was the fear that had filled his mind for the last twenty-four hours,
 for he was thoroughly acquainted with the country and had watched narrowly
 every movement of the troops during the previous day, and now, again,
 while the broad valley before him lay basking in the radiant sunlight, his
 gaze reverted to the hills of the left bank, where, for the space of all
 one day and all one night, his eyes had beheld the black swarm of the
 Prussian hosts moving steadily onward to some appointed end. A battery had
 opened fire from Remilly, over to the left, but the one from which the
 shells were now beginning to reach the French position was posted at
 Pont-Maugis, on the river bank. He adjusted his binocle by folding the
 glasses over, the one upon the other, to lengthen its range and enable him
 to discern what was hidden among the recesses of the wooded slopes, but
 could distinguish nothing save the white smoke-wreaths that rose
 momentarily on the tranquil air and floated lazily away over the crests.
 That human torrent that he had seen so lately streaming over those hills,
 where was it now&mdash;where were massed those innumerable hosts? At last,
 at the corner of a pine wood, above Noyers and Frenois, he succeeded in
 making out a little cluster of mounted men in uniform&mdash;some general,
 doubtless, and his staff. And off there to the west the Meuse curved in a
 great loop, and in that direction lay their sole line of retreat on
 Mezieres, a narrow road that traversed the pass of Saint-Albert, between
 that loop and the dark forest of Ardennes. While reconnoitering the day
 before he had met a general officer who, he afterward learned, was Ducrot,
 commanding the 1st corps, on a by-road in the valley of Givonne, and had
 made bold to call his attention to the importance of that, their only line
 of retreat. If the army did not retire at once by that road while it was
 still open to them, if it waited until the Prussians should have crossed
 the Meuse at Donchery and come up in force to occupy the pass, it would be
 hemmed in and driven back on the Belgian frontier. As early even as the
 evening of that day the movement would have been too late. It was asserted
 that the uhlans had possession of the bridge, another bridge that had not
 been destroyed, for the reason, this time, that some one had neglected to
 provide the necessary powder. And Weiss sorrowfully acknowledged to
 himself that the human torrent, the invading horde, could now be nowhere
 else than on the plain of Donchery, invisible to him, pressing onward to
 occupy Saint-Albert pass, pushing forward its advanced guards to
 Saint-Menges and Floing, whither, the day previous, he had conducted Jean
 and Maurice. In the brilliant sunshine the steeple of Floing church
 appeared like a slender needle of dazzling whiteness.
 </p>
 <p>
 And off to the eastward the other arm of the powerful vise was slowly
 closing in on them. Casting his eyes to the north, where there was a
 stretch of level ground between the plateaus of Illy and of Floing, he
 could make out the line of battle of the 7th corps, feebly supported by
 the 5th, which was posted in reserve under the ramparts of the city; but
 he could not discern what was occurring to the east, along the valley of
 the Givonne, where the 1st corps was stationed, its line stretching from
 the wood of la Garenne to Daigny village. Now, however, the guns were
 beginning to thunder in that direction also; the conflict seemed to be
 raging in Chevalier's wood, in front of Daigny. His uneasiness was owing
 to reports that had been brought in by peasants the day previous, that the
 Prussian advance had reached Francheval, so that the movement which was
 being conducted at the west, by way of Donchery, was also in process of
 execution at the east, by way of Francheval, and the two jaws of the vise
 would come together up there at the north, near the Calvary of Illy,
 unless the two-fold flanking movement could be promptly checked. He knew
 nothing of tactics or strategy, had nothing but his common sense to guide
 him; but he looked with fear and trembling on that great triangle that had
 the Meuse for one of its sides, and for the other two the 7th and 1st
 corps on the north and east respectively, while the extreme angle at the
 south was occupied by the 12th at Bazeilles&mdash;all the three corps
 facing outward on the periphery of a semicircle, awaiting the appearance
 of an enemy who was to deliver his attack at some one point, where or when
 no one could say, but who, instead, fell on them from every direction at
 once. And at the very center of all, as at the bottom of a pit, lay the
 city of Sedan, her ramparts furnished with antiquated guns, destitute of
 ammunition and provisions.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Understand," said Weiss, with a repetition of his previous gesture,
 extending his arms and bringing his hands slowly together, "that is how it
 will be unless your generals keep their eyes open. The movement at
 Bazeilles is only a feint&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But his explanation was confused and unintelligible to the lieutenant, who
 knew nothing of the country, and the young man shrugged his shoulders with
 an expression of impatience and disdain for the bourgeois in spectacles
 and frock coat who presumed to set his opinion against the marshal's.
 Irritated to hear Weiss reiterate his view that the attack on Bazeilles
 was intended only to mask other and more important movements, he finally
 shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hold your tongue, will you! We shall drive them all into the Meuse, those
 Bavarian friends of yours, and that is all they will get by their precious
 feint."
 </p>
 <p>
 While they were talking the enemy's skirmishers seemed to have come up
 closer; every now and then their bullets were heard thudding against the
 dyehouse wall, and our men, kneeling behind the low parapet of the
 courtyard, were beginning to reply. Every second the report of a chassepot
 rang out, sharp and clear, upon the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, of course! drive them into the Meuse, by all means," muttered Weiss,
 "and while we are about it we might as well ride them down and regain
 possession of the Carignan road." Then addressing himself to Delaherche,
 who had stationed himself behind the pump where he might be out of the way
 of the bullets: "All the same, it would have been their wisest course to
 make tracks last night for Mezieres, and if I were in their place I would
 much rather be there than here. As it is, however, they have got to show
 fight, since retreat is out of the question now."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you coming?" asked Delaherche, who, notwithstanding his eager
 curiosity, was beginning to look pale in the face. "We shall be unable to
 get into the city if we remain here longer."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, in one minute I will be with you."
 </p>
 <p>
 In spite of the danger that attended the movement he raised himself on
 tiptoe, possessed by an irresistible desire to see how things were
 shaping. On the right lay the meadows that had been flooded by order of
 the governor for the protection of the city, now a broad lake stretching
 from Torcy to Balan, its unruffled bosom glimmering in the morning
 sunlight with a delicate azure luster. The water did not extend as far as
 Bazeilles, however, and the Prussians had worked their way forward across
 the fields, availing themselves of the shelter of every ditch, of every
 little shrub and tree. They were now distant some five hundred yards, and
 Weiss was impressed by the caution with which they moved, the dogged
 resolution and patience with which they advanced, gaining ground inch by
 inch and exposing themselves as little as possible. They had a powerful
 artillery fire, moreover, to sustain them; the pure, cool air was vocal
 with the shrieking of shells. Raising his eyes he saw that the Pont-Maugis
 battery was not the only one that was playing on Bazeilles; two others,
 posted half way up the hill of Liry, had opened fire, and their
 projectiles not only reached the village, but swept the naked plain of la
 Moncelle beyond, where the reserves of the 12th corps were, and even the
 wooded slopes of Daigny, held by a division of the 1st corps, were not
 beyond their range. There was not a summit, moreover, on the left bank of
 the stream that was not tipped with flame. The guns seemed to spring
 spontaneously from the soil, like some noxious growth; it was a zone of
 fire that grew hotter and fiercer every moment; there were batteries at
 Noyers shelling Balan, batteries at Wadelincourt shelling Sedan, and at
 Frenois, down under la Marfee, there was a battery whose guns, heavier
 than the rest, sent their missiles hurtling over the city to burst among
 the troops of the 7th corps on the plateau of Floing. Those hills that he
 had always loved so well, that he had supposed were planted there solely
 to delight the eye, encircling with their verdurous slopes the pretty,
 peaceful valley that lay beneath, were now become a gigantic, frowning
 fortress, vomiting ruin and destruction on the feeble defenses of Sedan,
 and Weiss looked on them with terror and detestation. Why had steps not
 been taken to defend them the day before, if their leaders had suspected
 this, or why, rather, had they insisted on holding the position?
 </p>
 <p>
 A sound of falling plaster caused him to raise his head; a shot had grazed
 his house, the front of which was visible to him above the party wall. It
 angered him excessively, and he growled:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are they going to knock it about my ears, the brigands!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then close behind him there was a little dull, strange sound that he had
 never heard before, and turning quickly he saw a soldier, shot through the
 heart, in the act of falling backward. There was a brief convulsive
 movement of the legs; the youthful, tranquil expression of the face
 remained, stamped there unalterably by the hand of death. It was the first
 casualty, and the accountant was startled by the crash of the musket
 falling and rebounding from the stone pavement of the courtyard.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, I have seen enough, I am going," stammered Delaherche. "Come, if you
 are coming; if not, I shall go without you."
 </p>
 <p>
 The lieutenant, whom their presence made uneasy, spoke up:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It will certainly be best for you to go, gentlemen. The enemy may attempt
 to carry the place at any moment."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then at last, casting a parting glance at the meadows, where the Bavarians
 were still gaining ground, Weiss gave in and followed Delaherche, but when
 they had gained the street he insisted upon going to see if the fastening
 of his door was secure, and when he came back to his companion there was a
 fresh spectacle, which brought them both to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the end of the street, some three hundred yards from where they stood,
 a strong Bavarian column had debouched from the Douzy road and was
 charging up the Place de l'Eglise. The square was held by a regiment of
 sailor-boys, who appeared to slacken their fire for a moment as if with
 the intention of drawing their assailants on; then, when the close-massed
 column was directly opposite their front, a most surprising maneuver was
 swiftly executed: the men abandoned their formation, some of them stepping
 from the ranks and flattening themselves against the house fronts, others
 casting themselves prone upon the ground, and down the vacant space thus
 suddenly formed the mitrailleuses that had been placed in battery at the
 farther end poured a perfect hailstorm of bullets. The column disappeared
 as if it had been swept bodily from off the face of the earth. The
 recumbent men sprang to their feet with a bound and charged the scattered
 Bavarians with the bayonet, driving them and making the rout complete.
 Twice the maneuver was repeated, each time with the same success. Two
 women, unwilling to abandon their home, a small house at the corner of an
 intersecting lane, were sitting at their window; they laughed approvingly
 and clapped their hands, apparently glad to have an opportunity to behold
 such a spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There, confound it!" Weiss suddenly said, "I forgot to lock the cellar
 door! I must go back. Wait for me; I won't be a minute."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no indication that the enemy contemplated a renewal of their
 attack, and Delaherche, whose curiosity was reviving after the shock it
 had sustained, was less eager to get away. He had halted in front of his
 dyehouse and was conversing with the concierge, who had come for a moment
 to the door of the room she occupied in the <i>rez-de-chaussee</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor Francoise, you had better come along with us. A lone woman among
 such dreadful sights&mdash;I can't bear to think of it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She raised her trembling hands. "Ah, sir, I would have gone when the
 others went, indeed I would, if it had not been for my poor sick boy. Come
 in, sir, and look at him."
 </p>
 <p>
 He did not enter, but glanced into the apartment from the threshold, and
 shook his head sorrowfully at sight of the little fellow in his clean,
 white bed, his face exhibiting the scarlet hue of the disease, and his
 glassy, burning eyes bent wistfully on his mother.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But why can't you take him with you?" he urged. "I will find quarters for
 you in Sedan. Wrap him up warmly in a blanket, and come along with us."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, sir, I cannot. The doctor told me it would kill him. If only his
 poor father were alive! but we two are all that are left, and we must live
 for each other. And then, perhaps the Prussians will be merciful; perhaps
 they won't harm a lone woman and a sick boy."
 </p>
 <p>
 Just then Weiss reappeared, having secured his premises to his
 satisfaction. "There, I think it will trouble them some to get in now.
 Come on! And it is not going to be a very pleasant journey, either; keep
 close to the houses, unless you want to come to grief."
 </p>
 <p>
 There were indications, indeed, that the enemy were making ready for
 another assault. The infantry fire was spluttering away more furiously
 than ever, and the screaming of the shells was incessant. Two had already
 fallen in the street a hundred yards away, and a third had imbedded
 itself, without bursting, in the soft ground of the adjacent garden.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, here is Francoise," continued the accountant. "I must have a look at
 your little Charles. Come, come, you have no cause for alarm; he will be
 all right in a couple of days. Keep your courage up, and the first thing
 you do go inside, and don't put your nose outside the door." And the two
 men at last started to go.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, Francoise."
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, sirs."
 </p>
 <p>
 And as they spoke, there came an appalling crash. It was a shell, which,
 having first wrecked the chimney of Weiss's house, fell upon the sidewalk,
 where it exploded with such terrific force as to break every window in the
 vicinity. At first it was impossible to distinguish anything in the dense
 cloud of dust and smoke that rose in the air, but presently this drifted
 away, disclosing the ruined facade of the dyehouse, and there, stretched
 across the threshold, Francoise, a corpse, horribly torn and mangled, her
 skull crushed in, a fearful spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss sprang to her side. Language failed him; he could only express his
 feelings by oaths and imprecations.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> <i>Nom de Dieu!</i>"
 </p>
 <p>
 Yes, she was dead. He had stooped to feel her pulse, and as he arose he
 saw before him the scarlet face of little Charles, who had raised himself
 in bed to look at his mother. He spoke no word, he uttered no cry; he
 gazed with blazing, tearless eyes, distended as if they would start from
 their sockets, upon the shapeless mass that was strange, unknown to him;
 and nothing more.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss found words at last: "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> they have taken to killing
 women!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had risen to his feet; he shook his fist at the Bavarians, whose
 braid-trimmed helmets were commencing to appear again in the direction of
 the church. The chimney, in falling, had crushed a great hole in the roof
 of his house, and the sight of the havoc made him furious.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Dirty loafers! You murder women, you have destroyed my house. No, no! I
 will not go now, I cannot; I shall stay here."
 </p>
 <p>
 He darted away and came running back with the dead soldier's rifle and
 ammunition. He was accustomed to carry a pair of spectacles on his person
 for use on occasions of emergency, when he wished to see with great
 distinctness, but did not wear them habitually out of respect for the
 wishes of his young wife. He now impatiently tore off his double eyeglass
 and substituted the spectacles, and the big, burly bourgeois, his overcoat
 flapping about his legs, his honest, kindly, round face ablaze with wrath,
 who would have been ridiculous had he not been so superbly heroic,
 proceeded to open fire, peppering away at the Bavarians at the bottom of
 the street. It was in his blood, he said; he had been hankering for
 something of the kind ever since the days of his boyhood, down there in
 Alsace, when he had been told all those tales of 1814. "Ah! you dirty
 loafers! you dirty loafers!" And he kept firing away with such eagerness
 that, finally, the barrel of his musket became so hot it burned his
 fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
 The assault was made with great vigor and determination. There was no
 longer any sound of musketry in the direction of the meadows. The
 Bavarians had gained possession of a narrow stream, fringed with willows
 and poplars, and were making preparations for storming the houses, or
 rather fortresses, in the Place de l'Eglise. Their skirmishers had fallen
 back with the same caution that characterized their advance, and the wide
 grassy plain, dotted here and there with a black form where some poor
 fellow had laid down his life, lay spread in the mellow, slumbrous
 sunshine like a great cloth of gold. The lieutenant, knowing that the
 street was now to be the scene of action, had evacuated the courtyard of
 the dyehouse, leaving there only one man as guard. He rapidly posted his
 men along the sidewalk with instructions, should the enemy carry the
 position, to withdraw into the building, barricade the first floor, and
 defend themselves there as long as they had a cartridge left. The men
 fired at will, lying prone upon the ground, and sheltering themselves as
 best they might behind posts and every little projection of the walls, and
 the storm of lead, interspersed with tongues of flame and puffs of smoke,
 that tore through that broad, deserted, sunny avenue was like a downpour
 of hail beaten level by the fierce blast of winter. A woman was seen to
 cross the roadway, running with wild, uncertain steps, and she escaped
 uninjured. Next, an old man, a peasant, in his blouse, who would not be
 satisfied until he saw his worthless nag stabled, received a bullet square
 in his forehead, and the violence of the impact was such that it hurled
 him into the middle of the street. A shell had gone crashing through the
 roof of the church; two others fell and set fire to houses, which burned
 with a pale flame in the intense daylight, with a loud snapping and
 crackling of their timbers. And that poor woman, who lay crushed and
 bleeding in the doorway of the house where her sick boy was, that old man
 with a bullet in his brain, all that work of ruin and devastation,
 maddened the few inhabitants who had chosen to end their days in their
 native village rather than seek safety in Belgium. Other bourgeois, and
 workingmen as well, the neatly attired citizen alongside the man in
 overalls, had possessed themselves of the weapons of dead soldiers, and
 were in the street defending their firesides or firing vengefully from the
 windows.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" suddenly said Weiss, "the scoundrels have got around to our rear. I
 saw them sneaking along the railroad track. Hark! don't you hear them off
 there to the left?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The heavy fire of musketry that was now audible behind the park of
 Montivilliers, the trees of which overhung the road, made it evident that
 something of importance was occurring in that direction. Should the enemy
 gain possession of the park Bazeilles would be at their mercy, but the
 briskness of the firing was in itself proof that the general commanding
 the 12th corps had anticipated the movement and that the position was
 adequately defended.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look out, there, you blockhead!" exclaimed the lieutenant, violently
 forcing Weiss up against the wall; "do you want to get yourself blown to
 pieces?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He could not help laughing a little at the queer figure of the big
 gentleman in spectacles, but his bravery had inspired him with a very
 genuine feeling of respect, so, when his practiced ear detected a shell
 coming their way, he had acted the part of a friend and placed the
 civilian in a safer position. The missile landed some ten paces from where
 they were and exploded, covering them both with earth and debris. The
 citizen kept his feet and received not so much as a scratch, while the
 officer had both legs broken.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is well!" was all he said; "they have sent me my reckoning!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He caused his men to take him across the sidewalk and place him with his
 back to the wall, near where the dead woman lay, stretched across her
 doorstep. His boyish face had lost nothing of its energy and
 determination.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It don't matter, my children; listen to what I say. Don't fire too
 hurriedly; take your time. When the time comes for you to charge, I will
 tell you."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he continued to command them still, with head erect, watchful of the
 movements of the distant enemy. Another house was burning, directly across
 the street. The crash and rattle of musketry, the roar of bursting shells,
 rent the air, thick with dust and sulphurous smoke. Men dropped at the
 corner of every lane and alley; corpses scattered here and there upon the
 pavement, singly or in little groups, made splotches of dark color,
 hideously splashed with red. And over the doomed village a frightful
 uproar rose and swelled, the vindictive shouts of thousands, devoting to
 destruction a few hundred brave men, resolute to die.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Delaherche, who all this time had been frantically shouting to Weiss
 without intermission, addressed him one last appeal:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You won't come? Very well! then I shall leave you to your fate. Adieu!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was seven o'clock, and he had delayed his departure too long. So long
 as the houses were there to afford him shelter he took advantage of every
 doorway, of every bit of projecting wall, shrinking at every volley into
 cavities that were ridiculously small in comparison with his bulk. He
 turned and twisted in and out with the sinuous dexterity of the serpent;
 he would never have supposed that there was so much of his youthful
 agility left in him. When he reached the end of the village, however, and
 had to make his way for a space of some three hundred yards along the
 deserted, empty road, swept by the batteries on Liry hill, although the
 perspiration was streaming from his face and body, he shivered and his
 teeth chattered. For a minute or so he advanced cautiously along the bed
 of a dry ditch, bent almost double, then, suddenly forsaking the
 protecting shelter, burst into the open and ran for it with might and
 main, wildly, aimlessly, his ears ringing with detonations that sounded to
 him like thunder-claps. His eyes burned like coals of fire; it seemed to
 him that he was wrapt in flame. It was an eternity of torture. Then he
 suddenly caught sight of a little house to his left, and he rushed for the
 friendly refuge, gained it, with a sensation as if an immense load had
 been lifted from his breast. The place was tenanted, there were men and
 horses there. At first he could distinguish nothing. What he beheld
 subsequently filled him with amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
 Was not that the Emperor, attended by his brilliant staff? He hesitated,
 although for the last two days he had been boasting of his acquaintance
 with him, then stood staring, open-mouthed. It was indeed Napoleon III.;
 he appeared larger, somehow, and more imposing on horseback, and his
 mustache was so stiffly waxed, there was such a brilliant color on his
 cheeks, that Delaherche saw at once he had been "made up" and painted like
 an actor. He had had recourse to cosmetics to conceal from his army the
 ravages that anxiety and illness had wrought in his countenance, the
 ghastly pallor of his face, his pinched nose, his dull, sunken eyes, and
 having been notified at five o'clock that there was fighting at Bazeilles,
 had come forth to see, sadly and silently, like a phantom with rouged
 cheeks.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a brick-kiln near by, behind which there was safety from the
 rain of bullets that kept pattering incessantly on its other front and the
 shells that burst at every second on the road. The mounted group had
 halted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Sire," someone murmured, "you are in danger&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the Emperor turned and motioned to his staff to take refuge in the
 narrow road that skirted the kiln, where men and horses would be sheltered
 from the fire.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Really, Sire, this is madness. Sire, we entreat you&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 His only answer was to repeat his gesture; probably he thought that the
 appearance of a group of brilliant uniforms on that deserted road would
 draw the fire of the batteries on the left bank. Entirely unattended he
 rode forward into the midst of the storm of shot and shell, calmly,
 unhurriedly, with his unvarying air of resigned indifference, the air of
 one who goes to meet his appointed fate. Could it be that he heard behind
 him the implacable voice that was urging him onward, that voice from
 Paris: "March! march! die the hero's death on the piled corpses of thy
 countrymen, let the whole world look on in awe-struck admiration, so that
 thy son may reign!"&mdash;could that be what he heard? He rode forward,
 controlling his charger to a slow walk. For the space of a hundred yards
 he thus rode forward, then halted, awaiting the death he had come there to
 seek. The bullets sang in concert with a music like the fierce autumnal
 blast; a shell burst in front of him and covered him with earth. He
 maintained his attitude of patient waiting. His steed, with distended eyes
 and quivering frame, instinctively recoiled before the grim presence who
 was so close at hand and yet refused to smite horse or rider. At last the
 trying experience came to an end, and the Emperor, with his stoic
 fatalism, understanding that his time was not yet come, tranquilly
 retraced his steps, as if his only object had been to reconnoiter the
 position of the German batteries.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What courage, Sire! We beseech you, do not expose yourself further&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But, unmindful of their solicitations, he beckoned to his staff to follow
 him, not offering at present to consult their safety more than he did his
 own, and turned his horse's head toward la Moncelle, quitting the road and
 taking the abandoned fields of la Ripaille. A captain was mortally
 wounded, two horses were killed. As he passed along the line of the 12th
 corps, appearing and vanishing like a specter, the men eyed him with
 curiosity, but did not cheer.
 </p>
 <p>
 To all these events had Delaherche been witness, and now he trembled at
 the thought that he, too, as soon as he should have left the brick works,
 would have to run the gauntlet of those terrible projectiles. He lingered,
 listening to the conversation of some dismounted officers who had remained
 there.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I tell you he was killed on the spot; cut in two by a shell."
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are wrong, I saw him carried off the field. His wound was not severe;
 a splinter struck him on the hip."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What time was it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, about an hour ago&mdash;say half-past six. It was up there around la
 Moncelle, in a sunken road."
 </p>
 <p>
 "I know he is dead."
 </p>
 <p>
 "But I tell you he is not! He even sat his horse for a moment after he was
 hit, then he fainted and they carried him into a cottage to attend to his
 wound."
 </p>
 <p>
 "And then returned to Sedan?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Certainly; he is in Sedan now."
 </p>
 <p>
 Of whom could they be speaking? Delaherche quickly learned that it was of
 Marshal MacMahon, who had been wounded while paying a visit of inspection
 to his advanced posts. The marshal wounded! it was "just our luck," as the
 lieutenant of marines had put it. He was reflecting on what the
 consequences of the mishap were likely to be when an <i>estafette</i>
 dashed by at top speed, shouting to a comrade, whom he recognized:
 </p>
 <p>
 "General Ducrot is made commander-in-chief! The army is ordered to
 concentrate at Illy in order to retreat on Mezieres!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The courier was already far away, galloping into Bazeilles under the
 constantly increasing fire, when Delaherche, startled by the strange
 tidings that came to him in such quick succession and not relishing the
 prospect of being involved in the confusion of the retreating troops,
 plucked up courage and started on a run for Balan, whence he regained
 Sedan without much difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <i>estafette</i> tore through Bazeilles on a gallop, disseminating the
 news, hunting up the commanders to give them their instructions, and as he
 sped swiftly on the intelligence spread among the troops: Marshal MacMahon
 wounded, General Ducrot in command, the army falling back on Illy!
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is that they are saying?" cried Weiss, whose face by this time was
 grimy with powder. "Retreat on Mezieres at this late hour! but it is
 absurd, they will never get through!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And his conscience pricked him, he repented bitterly having given that
 counsel the day before to that very general who was now invested with the
 supreme command. Yes, certainly, that was yesterday the best, the only
 plan, to retreat, without loss of a minute's time, by the Saint-Albert
 pass, but now the way could be no longer open to them, the black swarms of
 Prussians had certainly anticipated them and were on the plain of
 Donchery. There were two courses left for them to pursue, both desperate;
 and the most promising, as well as the bravest, of them was to drive the
 Bavarians into the Meuse, and cut their way through and regain possession
 of the Carignan road.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss, whose spectacles were constantly slipping down upon his nose,
 adjusted them nervously and proceeded to explain matters to the
 lieutenant, who was still seated against the wall with his two stumps of
 legs, very pale and slowly bleeding to death.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lieutenant, I assure you I am right. Tell your men to stand their ground.
 You can see for yourself that we are doing well. One more effort like the
 last, and we shall drive them into the river."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true that the Bavarians' second attack had been repulsed. The
 mitrailleuses had again swept the Place de l'Eglise, the heaps of corpses
 in the square resembled barricades, and our troops, emerging from every
 cross street, had driven the enemy at the point of the bayonet through the
 meadows toward the river in headlong flight, which might easily have been
 converted into a general rout had there been fresh troops to support the
 sailor-boys, who had suffered severely and were by this time much
 distressed. And in Montivilliers Park, again, the firing did not seem to
 advance, which was a sign that in that quarter, also, reinforcements,
 could they have been had, would have cleared the wood.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Order your men to charge them with the bayonet, lieutenant."
 </p>
 <p>
 The waxen pallor of death was on the poor boy-officer's face; yet he had
 strength to murmur in feeble accents:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You hear, my children; give them the bayonet!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was his last utterance; his spirit passed, his ingenuous, resolute face
 and his wide open eyes still turned on the battle. The flies already were
 beginning to buzz about Francoise's head and settle there, while lying on
 his bed little Charles, in an access of delirium, was calling on his
 mother in pitiful, beseeching tones to give him something to quench his
 thirst.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Mother, mother, awake; get up&mdash;I am thirsty, I am so thirsty."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the instructions of the new chief were imperative, and the officers,
 vexed and grieved to see the successes they had achieved thus rendered
 nugatory, had nothing for it but to give orders for the retreat. It was
 plain that the commander-in-chief, possessed by a haunting dread of the
 enemy's turning movement, was determined to sacrifice everything in order
 to escape from the toils. The Place de l'Eglise was evacuated, the troops
 fell back from street to street; soon the broad avenue was emptied of its
 defenders. Women shrieked and sobbed, men swore and shook their fists at
 the retiring troops, furious to see themselves abandoned thus. Many shut
 themselves in their houses, resolved to die in their defense.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, <i>I</i> am not going to give up the ship!" shouted Weiss, beside
 himself with rage. "No! I will leave my skin here first. Let them come on!
 let them come and smash my furniture and drink my wine!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Wrath filled his mind to the exclusion of all else, a wild, fierce desire
 to fight, to kill, at the thought that the hated foreigner should enter
 his house, sit in his chair, drink from his glass. It wrought a change in
 all his nature; everything that went to make up his daily life&mdash;wife,
 business, the methodical prudence of the small bourgeois&mdash;seemed
 suddenly to become unstable and drift away from him. And he shut himself
 up in his house and barricaded it, he paced the empty apartments with the
 restless impatience of a caged wild beast, going from room to room to make
 sure that all the doors and windows were securely fastened. He counted his
 cartridges and found he had forty left, then, as he was about to give a
 final look to the meadows to see whether any attack was to be apprehended
 from that quarter, the sight of the hills on the left bank arrested his
 attention for a moment. The smoke-wreaths indicated distinctly the
 position of the Prussian batteries, and at the corner of a little wood on
 la Marfee, over the powerful battery at Frenois, he again beheld the group
 of uniforms, more numerous than before, and so distinct in the bright
 sunlight that by supplementing his spectacles with his binocle he could
 make out the gold of their epaulettes and helmets.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You dirty scoundrels, you dirty scoundrels!" he twice repeated, extending
 his clenched fist in impotent menace.
 </p>
 <p>
 Those who were up there on la Marfee were King William and his staff. As
 early as seven o'clock he had ridden up from Vendresse, where he had had
 quarters for the night, and now was up there on the heights, out of reach
 of danger, while at his feet lay the valley of the Meuse and the vast
 panorama of the field of battle. Far as the eye could reach, from north to
 south, the bird's-eye view extended, and standing on the summit of the
 hill, as from his throne in some colossal opera box, the monarch surveyed
 the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the central foreground of the picture, and standing out in bold relief
 against the venerable forests of the Ardennes, that stretched away on
 either hand from right to left, filling the northern horizon like a
 curtain of dark verdure, was the city of Sedan, with the geometrical lines
 and angles of its fortifications, protected on the south and west by the
 flooded meadows and the river. In Bazeilles houses were already burning,
 and the dark cloud of war hung heavy over the pretty village. Turning his
 eyes eastward he might discover, holding the line between la Moncelle and
 Givonne, some regiments of the 12th and 1st corps, looking like diminutive
 insects at that distance and lost to sight at intervals in the dip of the
 narrow valley in which the hamlets lay concealed; and beyond that valley
 rose the further slope, an uninhabited, uncultivated heath, of which the
 pale tints made the dark green of Chevalier's Wood look black by contrast.
 To the north the 7th corps was more distinctly visible in its position on
 the plateau of Floing, a broad belt of sere, dun fields, that sloped
 downward from the little wood of la Garenne to the verdant border of the
 stream. Further still were Floing, Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, Illy, small
 villages that lay nestled in the hollows of that billowing region where
 the landscape was a succession of hill and dale. And there, too, to the
 left was the great bend of the Meuse, where the sluggish stream,
 shimmering like molten silver in the bright sunlight, swept lazily in a
 great horseshoe around the peninsula of Iges and barred the road to
 Mezieres, leaving between its further bank and the impassable forest but
 one single gateway, the defile of Saint-Albert.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was in that triangular space that the hundred thousand men and five
 hundred guns of the French army had now been crowded and brought to bay,
 and when His Prussian Majesty condescended to turn his gaze still further
 to the westward he might perceive another plain, the plain of Donchery, a
 succession of bare fields stretching away toward Briancourt, Marancourt,
 and Vrigne-aux-Bois, a desolate expanse of gray waste beneath the clear
 blue sky; and did he turn him to the east, he again had before his eyes,
 facing the lines in which the French were so closely hemmed, a vast level
 stretch of country in which were numerous villages, first Douzy and
 Carignan, then more to the north Rubecourt, Pourru-aux-Bois, Francheval,
 Villers-Cernay, and last of all, near the frontier, Chapelle. All about
 him, far as he could see, the land was his; he could direct the movements
 of the quarter of a million of men and the eight hundred guns that
 constituted his army, could master at a glance every detail of the
 operations of his invading host. Even then the XIth corps was pressing
 forward toward Saint-Menges, while the Vth was at Vrigne-aux-Bois, and the
 Wurtemburg division was near Donchery, awaiting orders. This was what he
 beheld to the west, and if, turning to the east, he found his view
 obstructed in that quarter by tree-clad hills, he could picture to himself
 what was passing, for he had seen the XIIth corps entering the wood of
 Chevalier, he knew that by that time the Guards were at Villers-Cernay.
 There were the two arms of the gigantic vise, the army of the Crown Prince
 of Prussia on the left, the Saxon Prince's army on the right, slowly,
 irresistibly closing on each other, while the two Bavarian corps were
 hammering away at Bazeilles.
 </p>
 <p>
 Underneath the King's position the long line of batteries, stretching with
 hardly an interval from Remilly to Frenois, kept up an unintermittent
 fire, pouring their shells into Daigny and la Moncelle, sending them
 hurtling over Sedan city to sweep the northern plateaus. It was barely
 eight o'clock, and with eyes fixed on the gigantic board he directed the
 movements of the game, awaiting the inevitable end, calmly controlling the
 black cloud of men that beneath him swept, an array of pigmies, athwart
 the smiling landscape.

 <h2>
 II.
 </h2>
 <p>
 In the dense fog up on the plateau of Floing Gaude, the bugler, sounded
 reveille at peep of day with all the lung-power he was possessed of, but
 the inspiring strain died away and was lost in the damp, heavy air, and
 the men, who had not had courage even to erect their tents and had thrown
 themselves, wrapped in their blankets, upon the muddy ground, did not
 awake or stir, but lay like corpses, their ashen features set and rigid in
 the slumber of utter exhaustion. To arouse them from their trance-like
 sleep they had to be shaken, one by one, and, with ghastly faces and
 haggard eyes, they rose to their feet, like beings summoned, against their
 will, back from another world. It was Jean who awoke Maurice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is it? Where are we!" asked the younger man. He looked affrightedly
 around him, and beheld only that gray waste, in which were floating the
 unsubstantial forms of his comrades. Objects twenty yards away were
 undistinguishable; his knowledge of the country availed him not; he could
 not even have indicated in which direction lay Sedan. Just then, however,
 the boom of cannon, somewhere in the distance, fell upon his ear. "Ah! I
 remember; the battle is for to-day; they are fighting. So much the better;
 there will be an end to our suspense!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He heard other voices around him expressing the same idea. There was a
 feeling of stern satisfaction that at last their long nightmare was to be
 dispelled, that at last they were to have a sight of those Prussians whom
 they had come out to look for, and before whom they had been retreating so
 many weary days; that they were to be given a chance to try a shot at
 them, and lighten the load of cartridges that had been tugging at their
 belts so long, with never an opportunity to burn a single one of them.
 Everyone felt that, this time, the battle would not, could not be avoided.
 </p>
 <p>
 But the guns began to thunder more loudly down at Bazeilles, and Jean bent
 his ear to listen.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Where is the firing?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Faith," replied Maurice, "it seems to me to be over toward the Meuse; but
 I'll be hanged if I know where we are."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look here, youngster," said the corporal, "you are going to stick close
 by me to-day, for unless a man has his wits about him, don't you see, he
 is likely to get in trouble. Now, I have been there before, and can keep
 an eye out for both of us."
 </p>
 <p>
 The others of the squad, meantime, were growling angrily because they had
 nothing with which to warm their stomachs. There was no possibility of
 kindling fires without dry wood in such weather as prevailed then, and so,
 at the very moment when they were about to go into battle, the inner man
 put in his claim for recognition, and would not be denied. Hunger is not
 conducive to heroism; to those poor fellows eating was the great, the
 momentous question of life; how lovingly they watched the boiling pot on
 those red-letter days when the soup was rich and thick; how like children
 or savages they were in their wrath when rations were not forthcoming!
 </p>
 <p>
 "No eat, no fight!" declared Chouteau. "I'll be blowed if I am going to
 risk my skin to-day!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The radical was cropping out again in the great hulking house-painter, the
 orator of Belleville, the pothouse politician, who drowned what few
 correct ideas he picked up here and there in a nauseous mixture of
 ineffable folly and falsehood.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Besides," he went on, "what good was there in making fools of us as they
 have been doing all along, telling us that the Prussians were dying of
 hunger and disease, that they had not so much as a shirt to their back,
 and were tramping along the highways like ragged, filthy paupers!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet laughed the laugh of the Parisian gamin, who has experienced the
 various vicissitudes of life in the Halles.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's all in my eye! it is we fellows who have been catching it
 right along; we are the poor devils whose leaky brogans and tattered
 toggery would make folks throw us a copper. And then those great victories
 about which they made such a fuss! What precious liars they must be, to
 tell us that old Bismarck had been made prisoner and that a German army
 had been driven over a quarry and dashed to pieces! Oh yes, they fooled us
 in great shape."
 </p>
 <p>
 Pache and Lapoulle, who were standing near, shook their heads and clenched
 their fists ominously. There were others, also, who made no attempt to
 conceal their anger, for the course of the newspapers in constantly
 printing bogus news had had most disastrous results; all confidence was
 destroyed, men had ceased to believe anything or anybody. And so it was
 that in the soldiers, children of a larger growth, their bright dreams of
 other days had now been supplanted by exaggerated anticipations of
 misfortune.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Pardi</i>!" continued Chouteau, "the thing is accounted for easily
 enough, since our rulers have been selling us to the enemy right from the
 beginning. You all know that it is so."
 </p>
 <p>
 Lapoulle's rustic simplicity revolted at the idea.
 </p>
 <p>
 "For shame! what wicked people they must be!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, sold, as Judas sold his master," murmured Pache, mindful of his
 studies in sacred history.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Chouteau's hour of triumph. "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> it is as plain as the
 nose on your face. MacMahon got three millions and each of the other
 generals got a million, as the price of bringing us up here. The bargain
 was made at Paris last spring, and last night they sent up a rocket as a
 signal to let Bismarck know that everything was fixed and he might come
 and take us."
 </p>
 <p>
 The story was so inanely stupid that Maurice was disgusted. There had been
 a time when Chouteau, thanks to his facundity of the faubourg, had
 interested and almost convinced him, but now he had come to detest that
 apostle of falsehood, that snake in the grass, who calumniated honest
 effort of every kind in order to sicken others of it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why do you talk such nonsense?" he exclaimed. "You know very well there
 is no truth in it."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, not true? Do you mean to say it is not true that we are betrayed?
 Ah, come, my aristocratic friend, perhaps you are one of them, perhaps you
 belong to the d&mdash;d band of dirty traitors?" He came forward
 threateningly. "If you are you have only to say so, my fine gentleman, for
 we will attend to your case right here, and won't wait for your friend
 Bismarck, either."
 </p>
 <p>
 The others were also beginning to growl and show their teeth, and Jean
 thought it time that he should interfere.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silence there! I will report the first man who says another word!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Chouteau sneered and jeered at him; what did he care whether he
 reported him or not! He was not going to fight unless he chose, and they
 need not try to ride him rough-shod, because he had cartridges in his box
 for other people beside the Prussians. They were going into action now,
 and what discipline had been maintained by fear would be at an end: what
 could they do to him, anyway? he would just skip as soon as he thought he
 had enough of it. And he was profane and obscene, egging the men on
 against the corporal, who had been allowing them to starve. Yes, it was
 his fault that the squad had had nothing to eat in the last three days,
 while their neighbors had soup and fresh meat in plenty, but "monsieur"
 had to go off to town with the "aristo" and enjoy himself with the girls.
 People had spotted 'em, over in Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You stole the money belonging to the squad; deny it if you dare, you <i>bougre</i>
 of a belly-god!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Things were beginning to assume an ugly complexion; Lapoulle was doubling
 his big fists in a way that looked like business, and Pache, with the
 pangs of hunger gnawing at his vitals, laid aside his natural douceness
 and insisted on an explanation. The only reasonable one among them was
 Loubet, who gave one of his pawky laughs and suggested that, being
 Frenchmen, they might as well dine off the Prussians as eat one another.
 For his part, he took no stock in fighting, either with fists or firearms,
 and alluding to the few hundred francs that he had earned as substitute,
 added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "And so, that was all they thought my hide was worth! Well, I am not going
 to give them more than their money's worth."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean were in a towering rage at the idotic onslaught, talking
 loudly and repelling Chouteau's insinuations, when out from the fog came a
 stentorian voice, bellowing:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What's this? what's this? Show me the rascals who dare quarrel in the
 company street!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And Lieutenant Rochas appeared upon the scene, in his old <i>kepi</i>,
 whence the rain had washed all the color, and his great coat, minus many
 of its buttons, evincing in all his lean, shambling person the extreme of
 poverty and distress. Notwithstanding his forlorn aspect, however, his
 sparkling eye and bristling mustache showed that his old time confidence
 had suffered no impairment.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean spoke up, scarce able to restrain himself. "Lieutenant, it is these
 men, who persist in saying that we are betrayed. Yes, they dare to assert
 that our generals have sold us&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 The idea of treason did not appear so extremely unnatural to Rochas's
 thick understanding, for it served to explain those reverses that he could
 not account for otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, suppose they are sold, is it any of their business? What concern is
 it of theirs? The Prussians are there all the same, aren't they? and we
 are going to give them one of the old-fashioned hidings, such as they
 won't forget in one while." Down below them in the thick sea of fog the
 guns at Bazeilles were still pounding away, and he extended his arms with
 a broad, sweeping gesture: "<i>Hein</i>! this is the time that we've got
 them! We'll see them back home, and kick them every step of the way!"
 </p>
 <p>
 All the trials and troubles of the past were to him as if they had not
 been, now that his ears were gladdened by the roar of the guns: the delays
 and conflicting orders of the chiefs, the demoralization of the troops,
 the stampede at Beaumont, the distress of the recent forced retreat on
 Sedan&mdash;all were forgotten. Now that they were about to fight at last,
 was not victory certain? He had learned nothing and forgotten nothing; his
 blustering, boastful contempt of the enemy, his entire ignorance of the
 new arts and appliances of war, his rooted conviction that an old soldier
 of Africa, Italy, and the Crimea could by no possibility be beaten, had
 suffered no change. It was really a little too comical that a man at his
 age should take the back track and begin at the beginning again!
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once his lantern jaws parted and gave utterance to a loud laugh. He
 was visited by one of those impulses of good-fellowship that made his men
 swear by him, despite the roughness of the jobations that he frequently
 bestowed on them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look here, my children, in place of quarreling it will be a great deal
 better to take a good nip all around. Come, I'm going to treat, and you
 shall drink my health."
 </p>
 <p>
 From the capacious pocket of his capote he extracted a bottle of brandy,
 adding, with his all-conquering air, that it was the gift of a lady. (He
 had been seen the day before, seated at the table of a tavern in Floing
 and holding the waitress on his lap, evidently on the best of terms with
 her.) The soldiers laughed and winked at one another, holding out their
 porringers, into which he gayly poured the golden liquor.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Drink to your sweethearts, my children, if you have any and don't forget
 to drink to the glory of France. Them's my sentiments, so <i>vive la joie</i>!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's right, Lieutenant. Here's to your health, and everybody else's!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They all drank, and their hearts were warmed and peace reigned once more.
 The "nip" had much of comfort in it, in the chill morning, just as they
 were going into action, and Maurice felt it tingling in his veins, giving
 him cheer and a sort of what is known colloquially as "Dutch courage." Why
 should they not whip the Prussians? Have not battles their surprises? has
 not history embalmed many an instance of the fickleness of fortune? That
 mighty man of war, the lieutenant, added that Bazaine was on the way to
 join them, would be with them before the day was over: oh, the information
 was positive; he had it from an aid to one of the generals; and although,
 in speaking of the route the marshal was to come by, he pointed to the
 frontier of Belgium, Maurice yielded to one of those spasmodic attacks of
 hopefulness of his, without which life to him would not have been worth
 living. Might it not be that the day of reckoning was at hand?
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why don't we move, Lieutenant?" he made bold to ask. "What are we waiting
 for?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas made a gesture, which the other interpreted to mean that no orders
 had been received. Presently he asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Has anybody seen the captain?"
 </p>
 <p>
 No one answered. Jean remembered perfectly having seen him making for
 Sedan the night before, but to the soldier who knows what is good for
 himself, his officers are always invisible when they are not on duty. He
 held his tongue, therefore, until happening to turn his head, he caught
 sight of a shadowy form flitting along the hedge.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here he is," said he.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Captain Beaudoin in the flesh. They were all surprised by the
 nattiness of his appearance, his resplendent shoes, his well-brushed
 uniform, affording such a striking contrast to the lieutenant's pitiful
 state. And there was a finicking completeness, moreover, about his toilet,
 greater than the male being is accustomed to bestow upon himself, in his
 scrupulously white hands and his carefully curled mustache, and a faint
 perfume of Persian lilac, which had the effect of reminding one in some
 mysterious way of the dressing room of a young and pretty woman.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo!" said Loubet, with a sneer, "the captain has recovered his
 baggage!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But no one laughed, for they all knew him to be a man with whom it was not
 well to joke. He was stiff and consequential with his men, and was
 detested accordingly; a <i>pete sec</i>, to use Rochas's expression. He
 had seemed to regard the early reverses of the campaign as personal
 affronts, and the disaster that all had prognosticated was to him an
 unpardonable crime. He was a strong Bonapartist by conviction; his
 prospects for promotion were of the brightest; he had several important
 salons looking after his interests; naturally, he did not take kindly to
 the changed condition of affairs that promised to make his cake dough. He
 was said to have a remarkably fine tenor voice, which had helped him no
 little in his advancement. He was not devoid of intelligence, though
 perfectly ignorant as regarded everything connected with his profession;
 eager to please, and very brave, when there was occasion for being so,
 without superfluous rashness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What a nasty fog!" was all he said, pleased to have found his company at
 last, for which he had been searching for more than half an hour.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the same time their orders came, and the battalion moved forward. They
 had to proceed with caution, feeling their way, for the exhalations
 continued to rise from the stream and were now so dense that they were
 precipitated in a fine, drizzling rain. A vision rose before Maurice's
 eyes that impressed him deeply; it was Colonel de Vineuil, who loomed
 suddenly from out the mist, sitting his horse, erect and motionless, at
 the intersection of two roads&mdash;the man appearing of preternatural
 size, and so pale and rigid that he might have served a sculptor as a
 study for a statue of despair; the steed shivering in the raw, chill air
 of morning, his dilated nostrils turned in the direction of the distant
 firing. Some ten paces to their rear were the regimental colors, which the
 sous-lieutenant whose duty it was to bear them had thus early taken from
 their case and proudly raised aloft, and as the driving, vaporous rack
 eddied and swirled about them, they shone like a radiant vision of glory
 emblazoned on the heavens, soon to fade and vanish from the sight. Water
 was dripping from the gilded eagle, and the tattered, shot-riddled
 tri-color, on which were embroidered the names of former victories, was
 stained and its bright hues dimmed by the smoke of many a battlefield; the
 sole bit of brilliant color in all the faded splendor was the enameled
 cross of honor that was attached to the <i>cravate</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Another billow of vapor came scurrying up from the river, enshrouding in
 its fleecy depths colonel, standard, and all, and the battalion passed on,
 whitherward no one could tell. First their route had conducted them over
 descending ground, now they were climbing a hill. On reaching the summit
 the command, halt! started at the front and ran down the column; the men
 were cautioned not to leave the ranks, arms were ordered, and there they
 remained, the heavy knapsacks forming a grievous burden to weary
 shoulders. It was evident that they were on a plateau, but to discern
 localities was out of the question; twenty paces was the extreme range of
 vision. It was now seven o'clock; the sound of firing reached them more
 distinctly, other batteries were apparently opening on Sedan from the
 opposite bank.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! I," said Sergeant Sapin with a start, addressing Jean and Maurice, "I
 shall be killed to-day."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the first time he had opened his lips that morning; an expression
 of dreamy melancholy had rested on his thin face, with its big, handsome
 eyes and thin, pinched nose.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What an idea!" Jean exclaimed; "who can tell what is going to happen him?
 Every bullet has its billet, they say, but you stand no worse chance than
 the rest of us."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, but me&mdash;I am as good as dead now. I tell you I shall be killed
 to-day."
 </p>
 <p>
 The near files turned and looked at him curiously, asking him if he had
 had a dream. No, he had dreamed nothing, but he felt it; it was there.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And it is a pity, all the same, because I was to be married when I got my
 discharge."
 </p>
 <p>
 A vague expression came into his eyes again; his past life rose before
 him. He was the son of a small retail grocer at Lyons, and had been petted
 and spoiled by his mother up to the time of her death; then rejecting the
 proffer of his father, with whom he did not hit it off well, to assist in
 purchasing his discharge, he had remained with the army, weary and
 disgusted with life and with his surroundings. Coming home on furlough,
 however, he fell in love with a cousin and they became engaged; their
 intention was to open a little shop on the small capital which she would
 bring him, and then existence once more became desirable. He had received
 an elementary education; could read, write, and cipher. For the past year
 he had lived only in anticipation of this happy future.
 </p>
 <p>
 He shivered, and gave himself a shake to dispel his revery, repeating with
 his tranquil air:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is too bad; I shall be killed to-day."
 </p>
 <p>
 No one spoke; the uncertainty and suspense continued. They knew not
 whether the enemy was on their front or in their rear. Strange sounds came
 to their ears from time to time from out the depths of the mysterious fog:
 the rumble of wheels, the deadened tramp of moving masses, the distant
 clatter of horses' hoofs; it was the evolutions of troops, hidden from
 view behind the misty curtain, the batteries, battalions, and squadrons of
 the 7th corps taking up their positions in line of battle. Now, however,
 it began to look as if the fog was about to lift; it parted here and there
 and fragments floated lightly off, like strips of gauze torn from a veil,
 and bits of sky appeared, not transparently blue, as on a bright summer's
 day, but opaque and of the hue of burnished steel, like the cheerless
 bosom of some deep, sullen mountain tarn. It was in one of those brighter
 moments when the sun was endeavoring to struggle forth that the regiments
 of chasseurs d'Afrique, constituting part of Margueritte's division, came
 riding by, giving the impression of a band of spectral horsemen. They sat
 very stiff and erect in the saddle, with their short cavalry jackets,
 broad red sashes and smart little <i>kepis</i>, accurate in distance and
 alignment and managing admirably their lean, wiry mounts, which were
 almost invisible under the heterogeneous collection of tools and camp
 equipage that they had to carry. Squadron after squadron they swept by in
 long array, to be swallowed in the gloom from which they had just emerged,
 vanishing as if dissolved by the fine rain. The truth was, probably, that
 they were in the way, and their leaders, not knowing what use to put them
 to, had packed them off the field, as had often been the case since the
 opening of the campaign. They had scarcely ever been employed on scouting
 or reconnoitering duty, and as soon as there was prospect of a fight were
 trotted about for shelter from valley to valley, useless objects, but too
 costly to be endangered.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice thought of Prosper as he watched them. "That fellow, yonder, looks
 like him," he said, under his breath. "I wonder if it is he?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Of whom are you speaking?" asked Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Of that young man of Remilly, whose brother we met at Osches, you
 remember."
 </p>
 <p>
 Behind the chasseurs, when they had all passed, came a general officer and
 his staff dashing down the descending road, and Maurice recognized the
 general of their brigade, Bourgain-Desfeuilles, shouting and gesticulating
 wildly. He had torn himself reluctantly from his comfortable quarters at
 the Hotel of the Golden Cross, and it was evident from the horrible temper
 he was in that the condition of affairs that morning was not satisfactory
 to him. In a tone of voice so loud that everyone could hear he roared:
 </p>
 <p>
 "In the devil's name, what stream is that off yonder, the Meuse or the
 Moselle?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The fog dispersed at last, this time in earnest. As at Bazeilles the
 effect was theatrical; the curtain rolled slowly upward to the flies,
 disclosing the setting of the stage. From a sky of transparent blue the
 sun poured down a flood of bright, golden light, and Maurice was no longer
 at a loss to recognize their position.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" he said to Jean, "we are on the plateau de l'Algerie. That village
 that you see across the valley, directly in our front, is Floing, and that
 more distant one is Saint-Menges, and that one, more distant still, a
 little to the right, is Fleigneux. Then those scrubby trees on the
 horizon, away in the background, are the forest of the Ardennes, and there
 lies the frontier&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 He went on to explain their position, naming each locality and pointing to
 it with outstretched hand. The plateau de l'Algerie was a belt of reddish
 ground, something less than two miles in length, sloping gently downward
 from the wood of la Garenne toward the Meuse, from which it was separated
 by the meadows. On it the line of the 7th corps had been established by
 General Douay, who felt that his numbers were not sufficient to defend so
 extended a position and properly maintain his touch with the 1st corps,
 which was posted at right angles with his line, occupying the valley of la
 Givonne, from the wood of la Garenne to Daigny.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, isn't it grand, isn't it magnificent!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice, revolving on his heel, made with his hand a sweeping gesture
 that embraced the entire horizon. From their position on the plateau the
 whole wide field of battle lay stretched before them to the south and
 west: Sedan, almost at their feet, whose citadel they could see
 overtopping the roofs, then Balan and Bazeilles, dimly seen through the
 dun smoke-clouds that hung heavily in the motionless air, and further in
 the distance the hills of the left bank, Liry, la Marfee, la Croix-Piau.
 It was away toward the west, however, in the direction of Donchery, that
 the prospect was most extensive. There the Meuse curved horseshoe-wise,
 encircling the peninsula of Iges with a ribbon of pale silver, and at the
 northern extremity of the loop was distinctly visible the narrow road of
 the Saint-Albert pass, winding between the river bank and a beetling,
 overhanging hill that was crowned with the little wood of Seugnon, an
 offshoot of the forest of la Falizette. At the summit of the hill, at the
 <i>carrefour</i> of la Maison-Rouge, the road from Donchery to
 Vrigne-aux-Bois debouched into the Mezieres pike.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See, that is the road by which we might retreat on Mezieres."
 </p>
 <p>
 Even as he spoke the first gun was fired from Saint-Menges. The fog still
 hung over the bottom-lands in shreds and patches, and through it they
 dimly descried a shadowy body of men moving through the Saint-Albert
 defile.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, they are there," continued Maurice, instinctively lowering his voice.
 "Too late, too late; they have intercepted us!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not eight o'clock. The guns, which were thundering more fiercely
 than ever in the direction of Bazeilles, now also began to make themselves
 heard at the eastward, in the valley of la Givonne, which was hid from
 view; it was the army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, debouching from the
 Chevalier wood and attacking the 1st corps, in front of Daigny village;
 and now that the XIth Prussian corps, moving on Floing, had opened fire on
 General Douay's troops, the investment was complete at every point of the
 great periphery of several leagues' extent, and the action was general all
 along the line.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice suddenly perceived the enormity of their blunder in not retreating
 on Mezieres during the night; but as yet the consequences were not clear
 to him; he could not foresee all the disaster that was to result from that
 fatal error of judgment. Moved by some indefinable instinct of danger, he
 looked with apprehension on the adjacent heights that commanded the
 plateau de l'Algerie. If time had not been allowed them to make good their
 retreat, why had they not backed up against the frontier and occupied
 those heights of Illy and Saint-Menges, whence, if they could not maintain
 their position, they would at least have been free to cross over into
 Belgium? There were two points that appeared to him especially
 threatening, the <i>mamelon</i> of Hattoy, to the north of Floing on the
 left, and the Calvary of Illy, a stone cross with a linden tree on either
 side, the highest bit of ground in the surrounding country, to the right.
 General Douay was keenly alive to the importance of these eminences, and
 the day before had sent two battalions to occupy Hattoy; but the men,
 feeling that they were "in the air" and too remote from support, had
 fallen back early that morning. It was understood that the left wing of
 the 1st corps was to take care of the Calvary of Illy. The wide expanse of
 naked country between Sedan and the Ardennes forest was intersected by
 deep ravines, and the key of the position was manifestly there, in the
 shadow of that cross and the two lindens, whence their guns might sweep
 the fields in every direction for a long distance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two more cannon shots rang out, quickly succeeded by a salvo; they
 detected the bluish smoke rising from the underbrush of a low hill to the
 left of Saint-Menges.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Our turn is coming now," said Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 Nothing more startling occurred just then, however. The men, still
 preserving their formation and standing at ordered arms, found something
 to occupy their attention in the fine appearance made by the 2d division,
 posted in front of Floing, with their left refused and facing the Meuse,
 so as to guard against a possible attack from that quarter. The ground to
 the east, as far as the wood of la Garenne, beneath Illy village, was held
 by the 3d division, while the 1st, which had lost heavily at Beaumont,
 formed a second line. All night long the engineers had been busy with pick
 and shovel, and even after the Prussians had opened fire they were still
 digging away at their shelter trenches and throwing up epaulments.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then a sharp rattle of musketry, quickly silenced, however, was heard
 proceeding from a point beneath Floing, and Captain Beaudoin received
 orders to move his company three hundred yards to the rear. Their new
 position was in a great field of cabbages, upon reaching which the captain
 made his men lie down. The sun had not yet drunk up the moisture that had
 descended on the vegetables in the darkness, and every fold and crease of
 the thick, golden-green leaves was filled with trembling drops, as
 pellucid and luminous as brilliants of the fairest water.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Sight for four hundred yards," the captain ordered.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice rested the barrel of his musket on a cabbage that reared its head
 conveniently before him, but it was impossible to see anything in his
 recumbent position: only the blurred surface of the fields traversed by
 his level glance, diversified by an occasional tree or shrub. Giving Jean,
 who was beside him, a nudge with his elbow, he asked what they were to do
 there. The corporal, whose experience in such matters was greater, pointed
 to an elevation not far away, where a battery was just taking its
 position; it was evident that they had been placed there to support that
 battery, should there be need of their services. Maurice, wondering
 whether Honore and his guns were not of the party, raised his head to
 look, but the reserve artillery was at the rear, in the shelter of a
 little grove of trees.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" yelled Rochas, "will you lie down!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice had barely more than complied with this intimation when a
 shell passed screaming over him. From that time forth there seemed to be
 no end to them. The enemy's gunners were slow in obtaining the range,
 their first projectiles passing over and landing well to the rear of the
 battery, which was now opening in reply. Many of their shells, too, fell
 upon the soft ground, in which they buried themselves without exploding,
 and for a time there was a great display of rather heavy wit at the
 expense of those bloody sauerkraut eaters.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, well!" said Loubet, "their fireworks are a fizzle!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "They ought to take them in out of the rain," sneered Chouteau.
 </p>
 <p>
 Even Rochas thought it necessary to say something. "Didn't I tell you that
 the dunderheads don't know enough even to point a gun?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But they were less inclined to laugh when a shell burst only ten yards
 from them and sent a shower of earth flying over the company; Loubet
 affected to make light of it by ordering his comrades to get out their
 brushes from the knapsacks, but Chouteau suddenly became very pale and had
 not a word to say. He had never been under fire, nor had Pache and
 Lapoulle, nor any member of the squad, in fact, except Jean. Over eyes
 that had suddenly lost their brightness lids flickered tremulously; voices
 had an unnatural, muffled sound, as if arrested by some obstruction in the
 throat. Maurice, who was sufficiently master of himself as yet, endeavored
 to diagnose his symptoms; he could not be afraid, for he was not conscious
 that he was in danger; he only felt a slight sensation of discomfort in
 the epigastric region, and his head seemed strangely light and empty;
 ideas and images came and went independent of his will. His recollection
 of the brave show made by the troops of the 2d division made him hopeful,
 almost to buoyancy; victory appeared certain to him if only they might be
 allowed to go at the enemy with the bayonet.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen!" he murmured, "how the flies buzz; the place is full of them."
 Thrice he had heard something that sounded like the humming of a swarm of
 bees.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That was not a fly," Jean said, with a laugh. "It was a bullet."
 </p>
 <p>
 Again and again the hum of those invisible wings made itself heard. The
 men craned their necks and looked about them with eager interest; their
 curiosity was uncontrollable&mdash;would not allow them to remain quiet.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here," Loubet said mysteriously to Lapoulle, with a view to raise a
 laugh at the expense of his simple-minded comrade, "when you see a bullet
 coming toward you you must raise your forefinger before your nose&mdash;like
 that; it divides the air, and the bullet will go by to the right or left."
 </p>
 <p>
 "But I can't see them," said Lapoulle.
 </p>
 <p>
 A loud guffaw burst from those near.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, crickey! he says he can't see them! Open your garret windows, stupid!
 See! there's one&mdash;see! there's another. Didn't you see that one? It
 was of the most beautiful green."
 </p>
 <p>
 And Lapoulle rolled his eyes and stared, placing his finger before his
 nose, while Pache fingered the scapular he wore and wished it was large
 enough to shield his entire person.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas, who had remained on his feet, spoke up and said jocosely:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Children, there is no objection to your ducking to the shells when you
 see them coming. As for the bullets, it is useless; they are too
 numerous!"
 </p>
 <p>
 At that very instant a soldier in the front rank was struck on the head by
 a fragment of an exploding shell. There was no outcry; simply a spurt of
 blood and brain, and all was over.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Poor devil!" tranquilly said Sergeant Sapin, who was quite cool and
 exceedingly pale. "Next!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the uproar had by this time become so deafening that the men could no
 longer hear one another's voice; Maurice's nerves, in particular, suffered
 from the infernal <i>charivari</i>. The neighboring battery was banging
 away as fast as the gunners could load the pieces; the continuous roar
 seemed to shake the ground, and the mitrailleuses were even more
 intolerable with their rasping, grating, grunting noise. Were they to
 remain forever reclining there among the cabbages? There was nothing to be
 seen, nothing to be learned; no one had any idea how the battle was going.
 And <i>was</i> it a battle, after all&mdash;a genuine affair? All that
 Maurice could make out, projecting his eyes along the level surface of the
 fields, was the rounded, wood-clad summit of Hattoy in the remote
 distance, and still unoccupied. Neither was there a Prussian to be seen
 anywhere on the horizon; the only evidence of life were the faint, blue
 smoke-wreaths that rose and floated an instant in the sunlight. Chancing
 to turn his head, he was greatly surprised to behold at the bottom of a
 deep, sheltered valley, surrounded by precipitous heights, a peasant
 calmly tilling his little field, driving the plow through the furrow with
 the assistance of a big white horse. Why should he lose a day? The corn
 would keep growing, let them fight as they would, and folks must live.
 </p>
 <p>
 Unable longer to control his impatience, the young man jumped to his feet.
 He had a fleeting vision of the batteries of Saint-Menges, crowned with
 tawny vapors and spewing shot and shell upon them; he had also time to
 see, what he had seen before and had not forgotten, the road from
 Saint-Albert's pass black with minute moving objects&mdash;the swarming
 hordes of the invader. Then Jean seized him by the legs and pulled him
 violently to his place again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you crazy? Do you want to leave your bones here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And Rochas chimed in:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lie down, will you! What am I to do with such d&mdash;&mdash;d rascals,
 who get themselves killed without orders!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "But you don't lie down, lieutenant," said Maurice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's a different thing. I have to know what is going on."
 </p>
 <p>
 Captain Beaudoin, too, kept his legs like a man, but never opened his lips
 to say an encouraging word to his men, having nothing in common with them.
 He appeared nervous and unable to remain long in one place, striding up
 and down the field, impatiently awaiting orders.
 </p>
 <p>
 No orders came, nothing occurred to relieve their suspense. Maurice's
 knapsack was causing him horrible suffering; it seemed to be crushing his
 back and chest in that recumbent position, so painful when maintained for
 any length of time. The men had been cautioned against throwing away their
 sacks unless in case of actual necessity, and he kept turning over, first
 on his right side, then on the left, to ease himself a moment of his
 burden by resting it on the ground. The shells continued to fall around
 them, but the German gunners did not succeed in getting the exact range;
 no one was killed after the poor fellow who lay there on his stomach with
 his skull fractured.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, is this thing to last all day?" Maurice finally asked Jean, in sheer
 desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Like enough. At Solferino they put us in a field of carrots, and there we
 stayed five mortal hours with our noses to the ground." Then he added,
 like the sensible fellow he was: "Why do you grumble? we are not so badly
 off here. You will have an opportunity to distinguish yourself before the
 day is over. Let everyone have his chance, don't you see; if we should all
 be killed at the beginning there would be none left for the end."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look," Maurice abruptly broke in, "look at that smoke over Hattoy. They
 have taken Hattoy; we shall have plenty of music to dance to now!"
 </p>
 <p>
 For a moment his burning curiosity, which he was conscious was now for the
 first time beginning to be dashed with personal fear, had sufficient to
 occupy it; his gaze was riveted on the rounded summit of the <i>mamelon</i>,
 the only elevation that was within his range of vision, dominating the
 broad expanse of plain that lay level with his eye. Hattoy was too far
 distant to permit him to distinguish the gunners of the batteries that the
 Prussians had posted there; he could see nothing at all, in fact, save the
 smoke that at each discharge rose above a thin belt of woods that served
 to mask the guns. The enemy's occupation of the position, of which General
 Douay had been forced to abandon the defense, was, as Maurice had
 instinctively felt, an event of the gravest importance and destined to
 result in the most disastrous consequences; its possessors would have
 entire command of all the surrounding plateau. This was quickly seen to be
 the case, for the batteries that opened on the second division of the 7th
 corps did fearful execution. They had now perfected their range, and the
 French battery, near which Beaudoin's company was stationed, had two men
 killed in quick succession. A quartermaster's man in the company had his
 left heel carried away by a splinter and began to howl most dismally, as
 if visited by a sudden attack of madness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Shut up, you great calf!" said Rochas. "What do you mean by yelling like
 that for a little scratch!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The man suddenly ceased his outcries and subsided into a stupid silence,
 nursing his foot in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 And still the tremendous artillery duel raged, and the death-dealing
 missiles went screaming over the recumbent ranks of the regiments that lay
 there on the sullen, sweltering plain, where no thing of life was to be
 seen beneath the blazing sun. The crashing thunder, the destroying
 hurricane, were masters in that solitude, and many long hours would pass
 before the end. But even thus early in the day the Germans had
 demonstrated the superiority of their artillery; their percussion shells
 had an enormous range, and exploded, with hardly an exception, on reaching
 their destination, while the French time-fuse shells, with a much shorter
 range, burst for the most part in the air and were wasted. And there was
 nothing left for the poor fellows exposed to that murderous fire save to
 hug the ground and make themselves as small as possible; they were even
 denied the privilege of firing in reply, which would have kept their mind
 occupied and given them a measure of relief; but upon whom or what were
 they to direct their rifles? since there was not a living soul to be seen
 upon the entire horizon!
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are we never to have a shot at them? I would give a dollar for just one
 chance!" said Maurice, in a frenzy of impatience. "It is disgusting to
 have them blazing away at us like this and not be allowed to answer."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Be patient; the time will come," Jean imperturbably replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 Their attention was attracted by the sound of mounted men approaching on
 their left, and turning their heads they beheld General Douay, who,
 accompanied by his staff, had come galloping up to see how his troops were
 behaving under the terrible fire from Hattoy. He appeared well pleased
 with what he saw and was in the act of making some suggestions to the
 officers grouped around him, when, emerging from a sunken road, General
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles also rode up. This officer, though he owed his
 advancement to "influence" was wedded to the antiquated African routine
 and had learned nothing by experience, sat his horse with great composure
 under the storm of projectiles. He was shouting to the men and
 gesticulating wildly, after the manner of Rochas: "They are coming, they
 will be here right away, and then we'll let them have the bayonet!" when
 he caught sight of General Douay and drew up to his side.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is it true that the marshal is wounded, general?" he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is but too true, unfortunately. I received a note from Ducrot only a
 few minutes ago, in which he advises me of the fact, and also notifies me
 that, by the marshal's appointment, he is in command of the army."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! so it is Ducrot who is to have his place! And what are the orders
 now?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The general shook his head sorrowfully. He had felt that the army was
 doomed, and for the last twenty-four hours had been strenuously
 recommending the occupation of Illy and Saint-Menges in order to keep a
 way of retreat open on Mezieres.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ducrot will carry out the plan we talked of yesterday: the whole army is
 to be concentrated on the plateau of Illy."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he repeated his previous gesture, as if to say it was too late.
 </p>
 <p>
 His words were partly inaudible in the roar of the artillery, but Maurice
 caught their significance clearly enough, and it left him dumfounded by
 astonishment and alarm. What! Marshal MacMahon wounded since early that
 morning, General Ducrot commanding in his place for the last two hours,
 the entire army retreating to the northward of Sedan&mdash;and all these
 important events kept from the poor devils of soldiers who were
 squandering their life's blood! and all their destinies, dependent on the
 life of a single man, were to be intrusted to the direction of fresh and
 untried hands! He had a distinct consciousness of the fate that was in
 reserve for the army of Chalons, deprived of its commander, destitute of
 any guiding principle of action, dragged purposelessly in this direction
 and in that, while the Germans went straight and swift to their
 preconcerted end with mechanical precision and directness.
 </p>
 <p>
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles had wheeled his horse and was moving away, when
 General Douay, to whom a grimy, dust-stained hussar had galloped up with
 another dispatch, excitedly summoned him back.
 </p>
 <p>
 "General! General!"
 </p>
 <p>
 His voice rang out so loud and clear, with such an accent of surprise,
 that it drowned the uproar of the guns.
 </p>
 <p>
 "General, Ducrot is no longer in command; de Wimpffen is chief. You know
 he reached here yesterday, just in the very thick of the disaster at
 Beaumont, to relieve de Failly at the head of the 5th corps&mdash;and he
 writes me that he has written instructions from the Minister of War
 assigning him to the command of the army in case the post should become
 vacant. And there is to be no more retreating; the orders now are to
 reoccupy our old positions, and defend them to the last."
 </p>
 <p>
 General Bourgain-Desfeuilles drank in the tidings, his eyes bulging with
 astonishment. "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" he at last succeeded in ejaculating,
 "one would like to know&mdash;But it is no business of mine, anyhow." And
 off he galloped, not allowing himself to be greatly agitated by this
 unexpected turn of affairs, for he had gone into the war solely in the
 hope of seeing his name raised a grade higher in the army list, and it was
 his great desire to behold the end of the beastly campaign as soon as
 possible, since it was productive of so little satisfaction to anyone.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then there was an explosion of derision and contempt among the men of
 Beaudoin's company. Maurice said nothing, but he shared the opinion of
 Chouteau and Loubet, who chaffed and blackguarded everyone without mercy.
 "See-saw, up and down, move as I pull the string! A fine gang they were,
 those generals! they understood one another; they were not going to pull
 all the blankets off the bed! What was a poor devil of a soldier to do
 when he had such leaders put over him? Three commanders in two hours'
 time, three great numskulls, none of whom knew what was the right thing to
 do, and all of them giving different orders! Demoralized, were they? Good
 Heavens, it was enough to demoralize God Almighty himself, and all His
 angels!" And the inevitable accusation of treason was again made to do
 duty; Ducrot and de Wimpffen wanted to get three millions apiece out of
 Bismarck, as MacMahon had done.
 </p>
 <p>
 Alone in advance of his staff General Douay sat on his horse a long time,
 his gaze bent on the distant positions of the enemy and in his eyes an
 expression of infinite melancholy. He made a minute and protracted
 observation of Hattoy, the shells from which came tumbling almost at his
 very feet; then, giving a glance at the plateau of Illy, called up an
 officer to carry an order to the brigade of the 5th corps that he had
 borrowed the day previous from General de Wimpffen, and which served to
 connect his right with the left of General Ducrot. He was distinctly heard
 to say these words:
 </p>
 <p>
 "If the Prussians should once get possession of the Calvary it would be
 impossible for us to hold this position an hour; we should be driven into
 Sedan."
 </p>
 <p>
 He rode off and was lost to view, together with his escort, at the
 entrance of the sunken road, and the German fire became hotter than
 before. They had doubtless observed the presence of the group of mounted
 officers; but now the shells, which hitherto had come from the front,
 began to fall upon them laterally, from the left; the batteries at
 Frenois, together with one which the enemy had carried across the river
 and posted on the peninsula of Iges, had established, in connection with
 the guns on Hattoy, an enfilading fire which swept the plateau de
 l'Algerie in its entire length and breadth. The position of the company
 now became most lamentable; the men, with death in front of them and on
 their flank, knew not which way to turn or which of the menacing perils to
 guard themselves against. In rapid succession three men were killed
 outright and two severely wounded.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was then that Sergeant Sapin met the death that he had predicted for
 himself. He had turned his head, and caught sight of the approaching
 missile when it was too late for him to avoid it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, here it is!" was all he said.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was no terror in the thin face, with its big handsome eyes; it was
 only pale; very pale and inexpressibly mournful. The wound was in the
 abdomen.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! do not leave me here," he pleaded; "take me to the ambulance, I
 beseech you. Take me to the rear."
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas endeavored to silence him, and it was on his brutal lips to say
 that it was useless to imperil two comrades' lives for one whose wound was
 so evidently mortal, when his better nature made its influence felt and he
 murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Be patient for a little, my poor boy, and the litter-bearers will come
 and get you."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the wretched man, whose tears were now flowing, kept crying, as one
 distraught that his dream of happiness was vanishing with his trickling
 life-blood:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Take me away, take me away&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally Captain Beaudoin, whose already unstrung nerves were further
 irritated by his pitiful cries, called for two volunteers to carry him to
 a little piece of woods a short way off where a flying ambulance had been
 established. Chouteau and Loubet jumped to their feet simultaneously,
 anticipating the others, seized the sergeant, one of them by the
 shoulders, the other by the legs, and bore him away on a run. They had
 gone but a little way, however, when they felt the body becoming rigid in
 the final convulsion; he was dying.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I say, he's dead," exclaimed Loubet. "Let's leave him here."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Chouteau, without relaxing his speed, angrily replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go ahead, you booby, will you! Do you take me for a fool, to leave him
 here and have them call us back!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They pursued their course with the corpse until they came to the little
 wood, threw it down at the foot of a tree, and went their way. That was
 the last that was seen of them until nightfall.
 </p>
 <p>
 The battery beside them had been strengthened by three additional guns;
 the cannonade on either side went on with increased fury, and in the
 hideous uproar terror&mdash;a wild, unreasoning terror&mdash;filled
 Maurice's soul. It was his first experience of the sensation; he had not
 until now felt that cold sweat trickling down his back, that terrible
 sinking at the pit of the stomach, that unconquerable desire to get on his
 feet and run, yelling and screaming, from the field. It was nothing more
 than the strain from which his nervous, high-strung temperament was
 suffering from reflex action; but Jean, who was observing him narrowly,
 detected the incipient crisis in the wandering, vacant eyes, and seizing
 him with his strong hand, held him down firmly at his side. The corporal
 lectured him paternally in a whisper, not mincing his words, but employing
 good, vigorous language to restore him to a sense of self-respect, for he
 knew by experience that a man in panic is not to be coaxed out of his
 cowardice. There were others also who were showing the white feather,
 among them Pache, who was whimpering involuntarily, in the low, soft voice
 of a little baby, his eyes suffused with tears. Lapoulle's stomach
 betrayed him and he was very ill; and there were many others who also
 found relief in vomiting, amid their comrade's loud jeers and laughter,
 which helped to restore their courage to them all.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God!" ejaculated Maurice, ghastly pale, his teeth chattering. "My
 God!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean shook him roughly. "You infernal coward, are you going to be sick
 like those fellows over yonder? Behave yourself, or I'll box your ears."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was trying to put heart into his friend by gruff but friendly speeches
 like the above, when they suddenly beheld a dozen dark forms emerging from
 a little wood upon their front and about four hundred yards away. Their
 spiked helmets announced them to be Prussians; the first Prussians they
 had had within reach of their rifles since the opening of the campaign.
 This first squad was succeeded by others, and in front of their position
 the little dust clouds that rose where the French shells struck were
 distinctly visible. It was all very vivid and clear-cut in the transparent
 air of morning; the Germans, outlined against the dark forest, presented
 the toy-like appearance of those miniature soldiers of lead that are the
 delight of children; then, as the enemy's shells began to drop in their
 vicinity with uncomfortable frequency, they withdrew and were lost to
 sight within the wood whence they had come.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Beaudoin's company had seen them there once, and to their eyes they
 were there still; the chassepots seemed to go off of their own accord.
 Maurice was the first man to discharge his piece; Jean, Pache, Lapoulle
 and the others all followed suit. There had been no order given to
 commence firing, and the captain made an attempt to check it, but desisted
 upon Rochas's representation that it was absolutely necessary as a measure
 of relief for the men's pent-up feelings. So, then, they were at liberty
 to shoot at last, they could use up those cartridges that they had been
 lugging around with them for the last month, without ever burning a single
 one! The effect on Maurice in particular was electrical; the noise he made
 had the effect of dispelling his fear and blunting the keenness of his
 sensations. The little wood had resumed its former deserted aspect; not a
 leaf stirred, no more Prussians showed themselves; and still they kept on
 blazing away as madly as ever at the immovable trees.
 </p>
 <p>
 Raising his eyes presently Maurice was startled to see Colonel de Vineuil
 sitting his big horse at no great distance, man and steed impassive and
 motionless as if carved from stone, patient were they under the leaden
 hail, with face turned toward the enemy. The entire regiment was now
 collected in that vicinity, the other companies being posted in the
 adjacent fields; the musketry fire seemed to be drawing nearer. The young
 man also beheld the regimental colors a little to the rear, borne aloft by
 the sturdy arm of the standard-bearer, but it was no longer the phantom
 flag that he had seen that morning, shrouded in mist and fog; the golden
 eagle flashed and blazed in the fierce sunlight, and the tri-colored silk,
 despite the rents and stains of many a battle, flaunted its bright hues
 defiantly to the breeze. Waving in the breath of the cannon, floating
 proudly against the blue of heaven, it shone like an emblem of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
 And why, now that the day of battle had arrived, should not victory perch
 upon that banner? With that reflection Maurice and his companions kept on
 industriously wasting their powder on the distant wood, producing havoc
 there among the leaves and twigs.

 III.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Sleep did not visit Henriette's eyes that night. She knew her husband to
 be a prudent man, but the thought that he was in Bazeilles, so near the
 German lines, was cause to her of deep anxiety. She tried to soothe her
 apprehensions by reminding herself that she had his solemn promise to
 return at the first appearance of danger; it availed not, and at every
 instant she detected herself listening to catch the sound of his footstep
 on the stair. At ten o'clock, as she was about to go to bed, she opened
 her window, and resting her elbows on the sill, gazed out into the night.
 </p>
 <p>
 The darkness was intense; looking downward, she could scarce discern the
 pavement of the Rue des Voyards, a narrow, obscure passage, overhung by
 old frowning mansions. Further on, in the direction of the college, a
 smoky street lamp burned dimly. A nitrous exhalation rose from the street;
 the squall of a vagrant cat; the heavy step of a belated soldier. From the
 city at her back came strange and alarming sounds: the patter of hurrying
 feet, an ominous, incessant rumbling, a muffled murmur without a name that
 chilled her blood. Her heart beat loudly in her bosom as she bent her ear
 to listen, and still she heard not the familiar echo of her husband's step
 at the turning of the street below.
 </p>
 <p>
 Hours passed, and now distant lights that began to twinkle in the open
 fields beyond the ramparts excited afresh her apprehensions. It was so
 dark that it cost her an effort of memory to recall localities. She knew
 that the broad expanse that lay beneath her, reflecting a dim light, was
 the flooded meadows, and that flame that blazed up and was suddenly
 extinguished, surely it must be on la Marfee. But never, to her certain
 knowledge, had there been farmer's house or peasant's cottage on those
 heights; what, then, was the meaning of that light? And then on every
 hand, at Pont-Maugis, Noyers, Frenois, other fires arose, coruscating
 fitfully for an instant and giving mysterious indication of the presence
 of the swarming host that lay hidden in the bosom of the night. Yet more:
 there were strange sounds and voices in the air, subdued murmurings such
 as she had never heard before, and that made her start in terror; the
 stifled hum of marching men, the neighing and snorting of steeds, the
 clash of arms, hoarse words of command, given in guttural accents; an evil
 dream of a demoniac crew, a witch's sabbat, in the depths of those unholy
 shades. Suddenly a single cannon-shot rang out, ear-rending, adding fresh
 terror to the dead silence that succeeded it. It froze her very marrow;
 what could it mean? A signal, doubtless, telling of the successful
 completion of some movement, announcing that everything was ready, down
 there, and that now the sun might rise.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was about two o'clock when Henriette, forgetting even to close her
 window, at last threw herself, fully dressed, upon her bed. Her anxiety
 and fatigue had stupefied her and benumbed her faculties. What could ail
 her, thus to shiver and burn alternately, she who was always so calm and
 self-reliant, moving with so light a step that those about her were
 unconscious of her existence? Finally she sank into a fitful, broken
 slumber that brought with it no repose, in which was present still that
 persistent sensation of impending evil that filled the dusky heavens. All
 at once, arousing her from her unrefreshing stupor, the firing commenced
 again, faint and muffled in the distance, not a single shot this time, but
 peal after peal following one another in quick succession. Trembling, she
 sat upright in bed. The firing continued. Where was she? The place seemed
 strange to her; she could not distinguish the objects in her chamber,
 which appeared to be filled with dense clouds of smoke. Then she
 remembered: the fog must have rolled in from the near-by river and entered
 the room through the window. Without, the distant firing was growing
 fiercer. She leaped from her bed and ran to the casement to listen.
 </p>
 <p>
 Four o'clock was striking from a steeple in Sedan, and day was breaking,
 tingeing the purplish mists with a sickly, sinister light. It was
 impossible to discern objects; even the college buildings, distant but a
 few yards, were undistinguishable. Where could the firing be, <i>mon Dieu</i>!
 Her first thought was for her brother Maurice; for the reports were so
 indistinct that they seemed to her to come from the north, above the city;
 then, listening more attentively, her doubt became certainty; the
 cannonading was there, before her, and she trembled for her husband. It
 was surely at Bazeilles. For a little time, however, she suffered herself
 to be cheered by a ray of hope, for there were moments when the reports
 seemed to come from the right. Perhaps the fighting was at Donchery, where
 she knew that the French had not succeeded in blowing up the bridge. Then
 she lapsed into a condition of most horrible uncertainty; it seemed to be
 now at Donchery, now at Bazeilles; which, it was impossible to decide,
 there was such a ringing, buzzing sensation in her head. At last the
 feeling of suspense became so acute that she felt she could not endure it
 longer; she <i>must</i> know; every nerve in her body was quivering with
 the ungovernable desire, so she threw a shawl over her shoulders and left
 the house in quest of news.
 </p>
 <p>
 When she had descended and was in the street Henriette hesitated a brief
 moment, for the little light that was in the east had not yet crept
 downward along the weather-blackened house-fronts to the roadway, and in
 the old city, shrouded in opaque fog, the darkness still reigned
 impenetrable. In the tap-room of a low pot-house in the Rue au Beurre,
 dimly lighted by a tallow candle, she saw two drunken Turcos and a woman.
 It was not until she turned into the Rue Maqua that she encountered any
 signs of life: soldiers slinking furtively along the sidewalk and hugging
 the walls, deserters probably, on the lookout for a place in which to
 hide; a stalwart trooper with despatches, searching for his captain and
 knocking thunderously at every door; a group of fat burghers, trembling
 with fear lest they had tarried there too long, and preparing to crowd
 themselves into one small carriole if so be they might yet reach Bouillon,
 in Belgium, whither half the population of Sedan had emigrated within the
 last two days. She instinctively turned her steps toward the
 Sous-Prefecture, where she might depend on receiving information, and her
 desire to avoid meeting acquaintances determined her to take a short cut
 through lanes and by-ways. On reaching the Rue du Four and the Rue des
 Laboureurs, however, she found an obstacle in her way; the place had been
 pre-empted by the ordnance department, and guns, caissons, forges were
 there in interminable array, having apparently been parked away in that
 remote corner the day before and then forgotten there. There was not so
 much as a sentry to guard them. It sent a chill to her heart to see all
 that artillery lying there silent and ineffective, sleeping its neglected
 sleep in the concealment of those deserted alleys. She was compelled to
 retrace her steps, therefore, which she did by passing through the Place
 du College to the Grande-Rue, where in front of the Hotel de l'Europe she
 saw a group of orderlies holding the chargers of some general officers,
 whose high-pitched voices were audible from the brilliantly lighted dining
 room. On the Place du Rivage and the Place Turenne the crowd was even
 greater still, composed of anxious groups of citizens, with women and
 children interspersed among the struggling, terror-stricken throng,
 hurrying in every direction; and there she saw a general emerge from the
 Hotel of the Golden Cross, swearing like a pirate, and spur his horse off
 up the street at a mad gallop, careless whom he might overturn. For a
 moment she seemed about to enter the Hotel de Ville, then changed her
 mind, and taking the Rue du Pont-de-Meuse, pushed on to the
 Sous-Prefecture.
 </p>
 <p>
 Never had Sedan appeared to her in a light so tragically sinister as now,
 when she beheld it in the livid, forbidding light of early dawn, enveloped
 in its shroud of fog. The houses were lifeless and silent as tombs; many
 of them had been empty and abandoned for the last two days, others the
 terrified owners had closely locked and barred. Shuddering, the city awoke
 to the cares and occupations of the new day; the morning was fraught with
 chill misery in those streets, still half deserted, peopled only by a few
 frightened pedestrians and those hurrying fugitives, the remnant of the
 exodus of previous days. Soon the sun would rise and send down its
 cheerful light upon the scene; soon the city, overwhelmed in the
 swift-rising tide of disaster, would be crowded as it had never been
 before. It was half-past five o'clock; the roar of the cannon, caught and
 deadened among the tall dingy houses, sounded more faintly in her ears.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the Sous-Prefecture Henriette had some acquaintance with the
 concierge's daughter, Rose by name, a pretty little blonde of refined
 appearance who was employed in Delaherche's factory. She made her way at
 once to the lodge; the mother was not there, but Rose received her with
 her usual amiability.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! dear lady, we are so tired we can scarcely stand; mamma has gone to
 lie down and rest a while. Just think! all night long people have been
 coming and going, and we have not been able to get a wink of sleep."
 </p>
 <p>
 And burning to tell all the wonderful sights that she had been witness to
 since the preceding day, she did not wait to be questioned, but ran on
 volubly with her narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
 "As for the marshal, he slept very well, but that poor Emperor! you can't
 think what suffering he has to endure! Yesterday evening, do you know, I
 had gone upstairs to help give out the linen, and as I entered the
 apartment that adjoins his dressing-room I heard groans, oh, <i>such</i>
 groans! just like someone dying. I thought a moment and knew it must be
 the Emperor, and I was so frightened I couldn't move; I just stood and
 trembled. It seems he has some terrible complaint that makes him cry out
 that way. When there are people around he holds in, but as soon as he is
 alone it is too much for him, and he groans and shrieks in a way to make
 your hair stand on end."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you know where the fighting is this morning?" asked Henriette,
 desiring to check her loquacity.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rose dismissed the question with a wave of her little hand and went on
 with her narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That made me curious to know more, you see, and I went upstairs four or
 five times during the night and listened, and every time it was just the
 same; I don't believe he was quiet an instant all night long, or got a
 minute's sleep. Oh! what a terrible thing it is to suffer like that with
 all he has to worry him! for everything is upside down; it is all a most
 dreadful mess. Upon my word, I believe those generals are out of their
 senses; such ghostly faces and frightened eyes! And people coming all the
 time, and doors banging and some men scolding and others crying, and the
 whole place like a sailor's boarding-house; officers drinking from bottles
 and going to bed in their boots! The Emperor is the best of the whole lot,
 and the one who gives least trouble, in the corner where he conceals
 himself and his suffering!" Then, in reply to Henriette's reiterated
 question: "The fighting? there has been fighting at Bazeilles this
 morning. A mounted officer brought word of it to the marshal, who went
 immediately to notify the Emperor. The marshal has been gone ten minutes,
 and I shouldn't wonder if the Emperor intends to follow him, for they are
 dressing him upstairs. I just now saw them combing him and plastering his
 face with all sorts of cosmetics."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Henriette, having finally learned what she desired to know, rose to
 go.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Rose. I am in somewhat of a hurry this morning."
 </p>
 <p>
 The young girl went with her to the street door, and took leave of her
 with a courteous:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Glad to have been of service to you, Madame Weiss. I know that anything
 said to you will go no further."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette hurried back to her house in the Rue des Voyards. She felt quite
 certain that her husband would have returned, and even reflected that he
 would be alarmed at not finding her there, and hastened her steps in
 consequence. As she drew near the house she raised her eyes in the
 expectation of seeing him at the window watching for her, but the window,
 wide open as she had left it when she went out, was vacant, and when she
 had run up the stairs and given a rapid glance through her three rooms, it
 was with a sinking heart that she saw they were untenanted save for the
 chill fog and continuous roar of the cannonade. The distant firing was
 still going on. She went and stood for a moment at the window; although
 the encircling wall of vapor was not less dense than it had been before,
 she seemed to have a clearer apprehension, now that she had received oral
 information, of the details of the conflict raging at Bazeilles, the
 grinding sound of the mitrailleuses, the crashing volleys of the French
 batteries answering the German batteries in the distance. The reports
 seemed to be drawing nearer to the city, the battle to be waxing fiercer
 and fiercer with every moment.
 </p>
 <p>
 Why did not Weiss return? He had pledged himself so faithfully not to
 outstay the first attack! And Henriette began to be seriously alarmed,
 depicting to herself the various obstacles that might have detained him:
 perhaps he had not been able to leave the village, perhaps the roads were
 blocked or rendered impassable by the projectiles. It might even be that
 something had happened him, but she put the thought aside and would not
 dwell on it, preferring to view things on their brighter side and finding
 in hope her safest mainstay and reliance. For an instant she harbored the
 design of starting out and trying to find her husband, but there were
 considerations that seemed to render that course inadvisable: supposing
 him to have started on his return, what would become of her should she
 miss him on the way? and what would be his anxiety should he come in and
 find her absent? Her guiding principle in all her thoughts and actions was
 her gentle, affectionate devotedness, and she saw nothing strange or out
 of the way in a visit to Bazeilles under such extraordinary circumstances,
 accustomed as she was, like an affectionate little woman, to perform her
 duty in silence and do the thing that she deemed best for their common
 interest. Where her husband was, there was her place; that was all there
 was about it.
 </p>
 <p>
 She gave a sudden start and left the window, saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Delaherche, how could I forget&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 It had just come to her recollection that the cloth manufacturer had also
 passed the night at Bazeilles, and if he had returned would be able to
 give her the intelligence she wanted. She ran swiftly down the stairs
 again. In place of taking the more roundabout way by the Rue des Voyards,
 she crossed the little courtyard of her house and entered the passage that
 conducted to the huge structure that fronted on the Rue Maqua. As she came
 out into the great central garden, paved with flagstones now and retaining
 of its pristine glories only a few venerable trees, magnificent
 century-old elms, she was astonished to see a sentry mounting guard at the
 door of a carriage-house; then it occurred to her that she had been told
 the day before that the camp chests of the 7th corps had been deposited
 there for safe keeping, and it produced a strange impression on her mind
 that all the gold, millions, it was said to amount to, should be lying in
 that shed while the men for whom it was destined were being killed not far
 away. As she was about to ascend the private staircase, however, that
 conducted to the apartment of Gilberte, young Madame Delaherche, she
 experienced another surprise in an encounter that startled her so that she
 retraced her steps a little way, doubtful whether it would not be better
 to abandon her intention, and go home again. An officer, a captain, had
 crossed her path, as noiselessly as a phantom and vanishing as swiftly,
 and yet she had had time to recognize him, having seen him in the past at
 Gilberte's house in Charleville, in the days when she was still Madame
 Maginot. She stepped back a few steps in the courtyard and raised her eyes
 to the two tall windows of the bedroom, the blinds of which were closed,
 then dismissed her scruples and entered.
 </p>
 <p>
 Upon reaching the first floor, availing herself of that privilege of old
 acquaintanceship by virtue of which one woman often drops in upon another
 for an unceremonious early morning chat, she was about to knock at the
 door of the dressing-room, but apparently someone had left the room
 hastily and failed to secure the door, so that it was standing ajar, and
 all she had to do was give it a push to find herself in the dressing room,
 whence she passed into the bedroom. From the lofty ceiling of the latter
 apartment depended voluminous curtains of red velvet, protecting the large
 double bed. The warm, moist air was fragrant with a faint perfume of
 Persian lilac, and there was no sound to break the silence save a gentle,
 regular respiration, scarcely audible.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Gilberte!" said Henriette, very softly.
 </p>
 <p>
 The young woman was sleeping peacefully, and the dim light that entered
 the room between the red curtains of the high windows displayed her
 exquisitely rounded head resting upon a naked arm and her profusion of
 beautiful hair straying in disorder over the pillow. Her lips were parted
 in a smile.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Gilberte!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She slightly moved and stretched her arms, without opening her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes; good-by. Oh! please&mdash;" Then, raising her head and
 recognizing Henriette: "What, is it you! How late is it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 When she learned that it had not yet struck six she seemed disconcerted,
 assuming a sportive air to hide her embarrassment, saying it was unfair to
 come waking people up at such an hour. Then, to her friend, questioning
 her about her husband, she made answer:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, he has not returned; I don't look for him much before nine o'clock.
 What makes you so eager to see him at this hour of the morning?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette's voice had a trace of sternness in it as she answered, seeing
 the other so smiling, so dull of comprehension in her happy waking.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I tell you there has been fighting all the morning at Bazeilles, and I am
 anxious about my husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, my dear," exclaimed Gilberte, "I assure you there is not the
 slightest reason for your feeling so. My husband is so prudent that he
 would have been home long ago had there been any danger. Until you see him
 back here you may rest easy, take my word for it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette was struck by the justness of the argument; Delaherche, it was
 true, was distinctly not a man to expose himself uselessly. She was
 reassured, and went and drew the curtains and threw back the blinds; the
 tawny light from without, where the sun was beginning to pierce the fog
 with his golden javelins, streamed in a bright flood into the apartment.
 One of the windows was part way open, and in the soft air of the spacious
 bedroom, but now so close and stuffy, the two women could hear the sound
 of the guns. Gilberte, half recumbent, her elbow resting on the pillow,
 gazed out upon the sky with her lustrous, vacant eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So, then, they are fighting," she murmured. Her chemise had slipped
 downward, exposing a rosy, rounded shoulder, half hidden beneath the
 wandering raven tresses, and her person exhaled a subtle, penetrating
 odor, the odor of love. "They are fighting, so early in the morning, <i>mon
 Dieu!</i> It would be ridiculous if it were not for the horror of it."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Henriette, in looking about the room, had caught sight of a pair of
 gauntlets, the gloves of a man, lying forgotten on a small table, and she
 started perceptibly. Gilberte blushed deeply, and extending her arms with
 a conscious, caressing movement, drew her friend to her and rested her
 head upon her bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes," she almost whispered, "I saw that you noticed it. Darling, you must
 not judge me too severely. He is an old friend; I told you all about it at
 Charleville, long ago, you remember." Her voice sank lower still; there
 was something that sounded very like a laugh of satisfaction in her tender
 tones. "He pleaded so with me yesterday that I would see him just once
 more. Just think, this morning he is in action; he may be dead by this.
 How could I refuse him?" It was all so heroic and so charming, the
 contrast was so delicious between war's stern reality and tender
 sentiment; thoughtless as a linnet, she smiled again, notwithstanding her
 confusion. Never could she have found it in her heart to drive him from
 her door, when circumstances all were propitious for the interview. "Do
 you condemn me?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette had listened to her confidences with a very grave face. Such
 things surprised her, for she could not understand them; it must be that
 she was constituted differently from other women. Her heart that morning
 was with her husband, her brother, down there where the battle was raging.
 How was it possible that anyone could sleep so peacefully and be so gay
 and cheerful when the loved ones were in peril?
 </p>
 <p>
 "But think of your husband, my dear, and of that poor young man as well.
 Does not your heart yearn to be with them? You do not reflect that their
 lifeless forms may be brought in and laid before your eyes at any moment."
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte raised her adorable bare arm before her face to shield her vision
 from the frightful picture.
 </p>
 <p>
 "O Heaven! what is that you say? It is cruel of you to destroy all the
 pleasure of my morning in this way. No, no; I won't think of such things.
 They are too mournful."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette could not refrain from smiling in spite of her anxiety. She was
 thinking of the days of their girlhood, and how Gilberte's father, Captain
 de Vineuil, an old naval officer who had been made collector of customs at
 Charleville when his wounds had incapacitated him for active service,
 hearing his daughter cough and fearing for her the fate of his young wife,
 who had been snatched from his arms by that terrible disease, consumption,
 had sent her to live at a farm-house near Chene-Populeux. The little maid
 was not nine years old, and already she was a consummate actress&mdash;a
 perfect type of the village coquette, queening it over her playmates,
 tricked out in what old finery she could lay hands on, adorning herself
 with bracelets and tiaras made from the silver paper wrappings of the
 chocolate. She had not changed a bit when, later, at the age of twenty,
 she married Maginot, the inspector of woods and forests. Mezieres, a dark,
 gloomy town, surrounded by ramparts, was not to her taste, and she
 continued to live at Charleville, where the gay, generous life, enlivened
 by many festivities, suited her better. Her father was dead, and with a
 husband whom, by reason of his inferior social position, her friends and
 acquaintances treated with scant courtesy, she was absolutely mistress of
 her own actions. She did not escape the censure of the stern moralists who
 inhabit our provincial cities, and in those days was credited with many
 lovers; but of the gay throng of officers who, thanks to her father's old
 connection and her kinship to Colonel de Vineuil, disported themselves in
 her drawing-room, Captain Beaudoin was the only one who had really
 produced an impression. She was light and frivolous&mdash;nothing more&mdash;adoring
 pleasure and living entirely in the present, without the least trace of
 perverse inclination; and if she accepted the captain's attentions, it is
 pretty certain that she did it out of good-nature and love of admiration.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You did very wrong to see him again," Henriette finally said, in her
 matter-of-fact way.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! my dear, since I could not possibly do otherwise, and it was only for
 just that once. You know very well I would die rather than deceive my new
 husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 She spoke with much feeling, and seemed distressed to see her friend shake
 her head disapprovingly. They dropped the subject, and clasped each other
 in an affectionate embrace, notwithstanding their diametrically different
 natures. Each could hear the beating of the other's heart, and they might
 have understood the tongues those organs spoke&mdash;one, the slave of
 pleasure, wasting and squandering all that was best in herself; the other,
 with the mute heroism of a lofty soul, devoting herself to a single
 ennobling affection.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But hark! how the cannon are roaring," Gilberte presently exclaimed. "I
 must make haste and dress."
 </p>
 <p>
 The reports sounded more distinctly in the silent room now that their
 conversation had ceased. Leaving her bed, the young woman accepted the
 assistance of her friend, not caring to summon her maid, and rapidly made
 her toilet for the day, in order that she might be ready to go downstairs
 should she be needed there. As she was completing the arrangement of her
 hair there was a knock at the door, and, recognizing the voice of the
 elder Madame Delaherche, she hastened to admit her.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Certainly, dear mother, you may come in."
 </p>
 <p>
 With the thoughtlessness that was part of her nature, she allowed the old
 lady to enter without having first removed the gauntlets from the table.
 It was in vain that Henriette darted forward to seize them and throw them
 behind a chair. Madame Delaherche stood glaring for some seconds at the
 spot where they had been with an expression on her face as if she were
 slowly suffocating. Then her glance wandered involuntarily from object to
 object in the room, stopping finally at the great red-curtained bed, the
 coverings thrown back in disorder.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I see that Madame Weiss has disturbed your slumbers. Then you were able
 to sleep, daughter?"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was plain that she had had another purpose in coming there than to make
 that speech. Ah, that marriage that her son had insisted on contracting,
 contrary to her wish, at the mature age of fifty, after twenty years of
 joyless married life with a shrewish, bony wife; he, who had always until
 then deferred so to her will, now swayed only by his passion for this gay
 young widow, lighter than thistle-down! She had promised herself to keep
 watch over the present, and there was the past coming back to plague her.
 But ought she to speak? Her life in the household was one of silent
 reproach and protest; she kept herself almost constantly imprisoned in her
 chamber, devoting herself rigidly to the observances of her austere
 religion. Now, however, the wrong was so flagrant that she resolved to
 speak to her son.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte blushingly replied, without an excessive manifestation of
 embarrassment, however:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, I had a few hours of refreshing sleep. You know that Jules has
 not returned&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Madame Delaherche interrupted her with a grave nod of her head. Ever since
 the artillery had commenced to roar she had been watching eagerly for her
 son's return, but she was a Spartan mother, and concealed her gnawing
 anxiety under a cloak of brave silence. And then she remembered what was
 the object of her visit there.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Your uncle, the colonel, has sent the regimental surgeon with a note in
 pencil, to ask if we will allow them to establish a hospital here. He
 knows that we have abundance of space in the factory, and I have already
 authorized the gentlemen to make use of the courtyard and the big
 drying-room. But you should go down in person&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, at once, at once!" exclaimed Henriette, hastening toward the door.
 "We will do what we can to help."
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte also displayed much enthusiasm for her new occupation as nurse;
 she barely took the time to throw a lace scarf over her head, and the
 three women went downstairs. When they reached the bottom and stood in the
 spacious vestibule, looking out through the main entrance, of which the
 leaves had been thrown wide back, they beheld a crowd collected in the
 street before the house. A low-hung carriage was advancing slowly along
 the roadway, a sort of carriole, drawn by a single horse, which a
 lieutenant of zouaves was leading by the bridle. They took it to be a
 wounded man that they were bringing to them, the first of their patients.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes! This is the place; this way!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But they were quickly undeceived. The sufferer recumbent in the carriole
 was Marshal MacMahon, severely wounded in the hip, who, his hurt having
 been provisionally cared for in the cottage of a gardener, was now being
 taken to the Sous-Prefecture. He was bareheaded and partially divested of
 his clothing, and the gold embroidery on his uniform was tarnished with
 dust and blood. He spoke no word, but had raised his head from the pillow
 where it lay and was looking about him with a sorrowful expression, and
 perceiving the three women where they stood, wide eyed with horror, their
 joined hands resting on their bosom, in presence of that great calamity,
 the whole army stricken in the person of its chief at the very beginning
 of the conflict, he slightly bowed his head, with a faint, paternal smile.
 A few of those about him removed their hats; others, who had no time for
 such idle ceremony, were circulating the report of General Ducrot's
 appointment to the command of the army. It was half-past seven o'clock.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And what of the Emperor?" Henriette inquired of a bookseller, who was
 standing at his door.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He left the city near an hour ago," replied the neighbor. "I was standing
 by and saw him pass out at the Balan gate. There is a rumor that his head
 was taken off by a cannon ball."
 </p>
 <p>
 But this made the grocer across the street furious. "Hold your tongue," he
 shouted, "it is an infernal lie! None but the brave will leave their bones
 there to-day!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When near the Place du College the marshal's carriole was lost to sight in
 the gathering crowd, among whose numbers the most strange and
 contradictory reports from the field of battle were now beginning to
 circulate. The fog was clearing; the streets were bright with sunshine.
 </p>
 <p>
 A hail, in no gentle terms, was heard proceeding from the courtyard: "Now
 then, ladies, here is where you are wanted, not outside!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They all three hastened inside and found themselves in presence of Major
 Bouroche, who had thrown his uniform coat upon the floor, in a corner of
 the room, and donned a great white apron. Above the broad expanse of, as
 yet, unspotted white, his blazing, leonine eyes and enormous head, with
 shock of harsh, bristling hair, seemed to exhale energy and determination.
 So terrible did he appear to them that the women were his most humble
 servants from the very start, obedient to his every sign, treading on one
 another to anticipate his wishes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There is nothing here that is needed. Get me some linen; try and see if
 you can't find some more mattresses; show my men where the pump is&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And they ran as if their life was at stake to do his bidding; were so
 active that they seemed to be ubiquitous.
 </p>
 <p>
 The factory was admirably adapted for a hospital. The drying-room was a
 particularly noticeable feature, a vast apartment with numerous and lofty
 windows for light and ventilation, where they could put in a hundred beds
 and yet have room to spare, and at one side was a shed that seemed to have
 been built there especially for the convenience of the operators: three
 long tables had been brought in, the pump was close at hand, and a small
 grass-plot adjacent might serve as ante-chamber for the patients while
 awaiting their turn. And the handsome old elms, with their deliciously
 cool shade, roofed the spot in most agreeably.
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche had considered it would be best to establish himself in Sedan at
 the commencement, foreseeing the dreadful slaughter and the inevitable
 panic that would sooner or later drive the troops to the shelter of the
 ramparts. All that he had deemed it necessary to leave with the regiment
 was two flying ambulances and some "first aids," that were to send him in
 the casualties as rapidly as possible after applying the primary
 dressings. The details of litter-bearers were all out there, whose duty it
 was to pick up the wounded under fire, and with them were the ambulance
 wagons and <i>fourgons</i> of the medical train. The two
 assistant-surgeons and three hospital stewards whom he had retained,
 leaving two assistants on the field, would doubtless be sufficient to
 perform what operations were necessary. He had also a corps of dressers
 under him. But he was not gentle in manner and language, for all he did
 was done impulsively, zealously, with all his heart and soul.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> how do you suppose we are going to distinguish
 the cases from one another when they begin to come in presently? Take a
 piece of charcoal and number each bed with a big figure on the wall
 overhead, and place those mattresses closer together, do you hear? We can
 strew some straw on the floor in that corner if it becomes necessary."
 </p>
 <p>
 The guns were barking, preparing his work for him; he knew that at any
 moment now the first carriage might drive up and discharge its load of
 maimed and bleeding flesh, and he hastened to get all in readiness in the
 great, bare room. Outside in the shed the preparations were of another
 nature: the chests were opened and their contents arranged in order on a
 table, packages of lint, bandages, compresses, rollers, splints for
 fractured limbs, while on another table, alongside a great jar of cerate
 and a bottle of chloroform, were the surgical cases with their
 blood-curdling array of glittering instruments, probes, forceps,
 bistouries, scalpels, scissors, saws, an arsenal of implements of every
 imaginable shape adapted to pierce, cut, slice, rend, crush. But there was
 a deficient supply of basins.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You must have pails, pots, jars about the house&mdash;something that will
 hold water. We can't work besmeared with blood all day, that's certain.
 And sponges, try to get me some sponges."
 </p>
 <p>
 Madame Delaherche hurried away and returned, followed by three women
 bearing a supply of the desired vessels. Gilberte, standing by the table
 where the instruments were laid out, summoned Henriette to her side by a
 look and pointed to them with a little shudder. They grasped each other's
 hand and stood for a moment without speaking, but their mute clasp was
 eloquent of the solemn feeling of terror and pity that filled both their
 souls. And yet there was a difference, for one retained, even in her
 distress, the involuntary smile of her bright youth, while in the eyes of
 the other, pale as death, was the grave earnestness of the heart which,
 one love lost, can never love again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How terrible it must be, dear, to have an arm or leg cut off!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Poor fellows!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche had just finished placing a mattress on each of the three tables,
 covering them carefully with oil-cloth, when the sound of horses' hoofs
 was heard outside and the first ambulance wagon rolled into the court.
 There were ten men in it, seated on the lateral benches, only slightly
 wounded; two or three of them carrying their arm in a sling, but the
 majority hurt about the head. They alighted with but little assistance,
 and the inspection of their cases commenced forthwith.
 </p>
 <p>
 One of them, scarcely more than a boy, had been shot through the shoulder,
 and as Henriette was tenderly assisting him to draw off his greatcoat, an
 operation that elicited cries of pain, she took notice of the number of
 his regiment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, you belong to the 106th! Are you in Captain Beaudoin's company?"
 </p>
 <p>
 No, he belonged to Captain Bonnaud's company, but for all that he was well
 acquainted with Corporal Macquart and felt pretty certain that his squad
 had not been under fire as yet. The tidings, meager as they were, sufficed
 to remove a great load from the young woman's heart: her brother was alive
 and well; if now her husband would only return, as she was expecting every
 moment he would do, her mind would be quite at rest.
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment, just as Henriette raised her head to listen to the
 cannonade, which was then roaring with increased viciousness, she was
 thunderstruck to see Delaherche standing only a few steps away in the
 middle of a group of men, to whom he was telling the story of the
 frightful dangers he had encountered in getting from Bazeilles to Sedan.
 How did he happen to be there? She had not seen him come in. She darted
 toward him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is not my husband with you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Delaherche, who was just then replying to the fond questions of his
 wife and mother, was in no haste to answer.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wait, wait a moment." And resuming his narrative: "Twenty times between
 Bazeilles and Balan I just missed being killed. It was a storm, a regular
 hurricane, of shot and shell! And I saw the Emperor, too. Oh! but he is a
 brave man!&mdash;And after leaving Balan I ran&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette shook him by the arm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My husband?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Weiss? why, he stayed behind there, Weiss did."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What do you mean, behind there?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, yes; he picked up the musket of a dead soldier, and is fighting away
 with the best of them."
 </p>
 <p>
 "He is fighting, you say?&mdash;and why?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "He must be out of his head, I think. He would not come with me, and of
 course I had to leave him."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette gazed at him fixedly, with wide-dilated eyes. For a moment no
 one spoke; then in a calm voice she declared her resolution.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is well; I will go to him."
 </p>
 <p>
 What, she, go to him? But it was impossible, it was preposterous!
 Delaherche had more to say of his hurricane of shot and shell. Gilberte
 seized her by the wrists to detain her, while Madame Delaherche used all
 her persuasive powers to convince her of the folly of the mad undertaking.
 In the same gentle, determined tone she repeated:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is useless; I will go to him."
 </p>
 <p>
 She would only wait to adjust upon her head the lace scarf that Gilberte
 had been wearing and which the latter insisted she should accept. In the
 hope that his offer might cause her to abandon her resolve Delaherche
 declared that he would go with her at least as far as the Balan gate, but
 just then he caught sight of the sentry, who, in all the turmoil and
 confusion of the time, had been pacing uninterruptedly up and down before
 the building that contained the treasure chests of the 7th corps, and
 suddenly he remembered, was alarmed, went to give a look and assure
 himself that the millions were there still. In the meantime Henriette had
 reached the portico and was about to pass out into the street.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wait for me, won't you? Upon my word, you are as mad as your husband!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Another ambulance had driven up, moreover, and they had to wait to let it
 pass in. It was smaller than the other, having but two wheels, and the two
 men whom it contained, both severely wounded, rested on stretchers placed
 upon the floor. The first one whom the attendants took out, using the most
 tender precaution, had one hand broken and his side torn by a splinter of
 shell; he was a mass of bleeding flesh. The second had his left leg
 shattered; and Bouroche, giving orders to extend the latter on one of the
 oil-cloth-covered mattresses, proceeded forthwith to operate on him,
 surrounded by the staring, pushing crowd of dressers and assistants.
 Madame Delaherche and Gilberte were seated near the grass-plot, employed
 in rolling bandages.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the street outside Delaherche had caught up with Henriette.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, my dear Madame Weiss, abandon this foolhardy undertaking. How can
 you expect to find Weiss in all that confusion? Most likely he is no
 longer there by this time; he is probably making his way home through the
 fields. I assure you that Bazeilles is inaccessible."
 </p>
 <p>
 But she did not even listen to him, only increasing her speed, and had now
 entered the Rue de Menil, her shortest way to the Balan gate. It was
 nearly nine o'clock, and Sedan no longer wore the forbidding, funereal
 aspect of the morning, when it awoke to grope and shudder amid the despair
 and gloom of its black fog. The shadows of the houses were sharply defined
 upon the pavement in the bright sunlight, the streets were filled with an
 excited, anxious throng, through which orderlies and staff officers were
 constantly pushing their way at a gallop. The chief centers of attraction
 were the straggling soldiers who, even at this early hour of the day, had
 begun to stream into the city, minus arms and equipments, some of them
 slightly wounded, others in an extreme condition of nervous excitation,
 shouting and gesticulating like lunatics. And yet the place would have had
 very much its every-day aspect, had it not been for the tight-closed
 shutters of the shops, the lifeless house-fronts, where not a blind was
 open. Then there was the cannonade, that never-ceasing cannonade, beneath
 which earth and rocks, walls and foundations, even to the very slates upon
 the roofs, shook and trembled.
 </p>
 <p>
 What between the damage that his reputation as a man of bravery and
 politeness would inevitably suffer should he desert Henriette in her time
 of trouble, and his disinclination to again face the iron hail on the
 Bazeilles road, Delaherche was certainly in a very unpleasant predicament.
 Just as they reached the Balan gate a bevy of mounted officers, returning
 to the city, suddenly came riding up, and they were parted. There was a
 dense crowd of people around the gate, waiting for news. It was all in
 vain that he ran this way and that, looking for the young woman in the
 throng; she must have been beyond the walls by that time, speeding along
 the road, and pocketing his gallantry for use on some future occasion, he
 said to himself aloud:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well, so much the worse for her; it was too idiotic."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then the manufacturer strolled about the city, bourgeois-like desirous to
 lose no portion of the spectacle, and at the same time tormented by a
 constantly increasing feeling of anxiety. How was it all to end? and would
 not the city suffer heavily should the army be defeated? The questions
 were hard ones to answer; he could not give a satisfactory solution to the
 conundrum when so much depended on circumstances, but none the less he was
 beginning to feel very uneasy for his factory and house in the Rue Maqua,
 whence he had already taken the precaution to remove his securities and
 valuables and bury them in a place of safety. He dropped in at the Hotel
 de Ville, found the Municipal Council sitting in permanent session, and
 loitered away a couple of hours there without hearing any fresh news,
 unless that affairs outside the walls were beginning to look very
 threatening. The army, under the pushing and hauling process, pushed back
 to the rear by General Ducrot during the hour and a half while the command
 was in his hands, hauled forward to the front again by de Wimpffen, his
 successor, knew not where to yield obedience, and the entire lack of plan
 and competent leadership, the incomprehensible vacillation, the
 abandonment of positions only to retake them again at terrible cost of
 life, all these things could not fail to end in ruin and disaster.
 </p>
 <p>
 From there Delaherche pushed forward to the Sous-Prefecture to ascertain
 whether the Emperor had returned yet from the field of battle. The only
 tidings he gleaned here were of Marshal MacMahon, who was said to be
 resting comfortably, his wound, which was not dangerous, having been
 dressed by a surgeon. About eleven o'clock, however, as he was again going
 the rounds, his progress was arrested for a moment in the Grande-Rue,
 opposite the Hotel de l'Europe, by a sorry cavalcade of dust-stained
 horsemen, whose jaded nags were moving at a walk, and at their head he
 recognized the Emperor, who was returning after having spent four hours on
 the battle-field. It was plain that death would have nothing to do with
 him. The big drops of anguish had washed the rouge from off those painted
 cheeks, the waxed mustache had lost its stiffness and drooped over the
 mouth, and in that ashen face, in those dim eyes, was the stupor of one in
 his last agony. One of the officers alighted in front of the hotel and
 proceeded to give some friends, who were collected there, an account of
 their route, from la Moncelle to Givonne, up the entire length of the
 little valley among the soldiers of the 1st corps, who had already been
 pressed back by the Saxons across the little stream to the right bank; and
 they had returned by the sunken road of the Fond de Givonne, which was
 even then in such an encumbered condition that had the Emperor desired to
 make his way to the front again he would have found the greatest
 difficulty in doing so. Besides, what would it have availed?
 </p>
 <p>
 As Delaherche was drinking in these particulars with greedy ears a loud
 explosion shook the quarter. It was a shell, which had demolished a
 chimney in the Rue Sainte-Barbe, near the citadel. There was a general
 rush and scramble; men swore and women shrieked. He had flattened himself
 against the wall, when another explosion broke the windows in a house not
 far away. The consequences would be dreadful if they should shell Sedan;
 he made his way back to the Rue Maqua on a keen run, and was seized by
 such an imperious desire to learn the truth that he did not pause below
 stairs, but hurried to the roof, where there was a terrace that commanded
 a view of the city and its environs.
 </p>
 <p>
 A glance of the situation served to reassure him; the German fire was not
 directed against the city; the batteries at Frenois and la Marfee were
 shelling the Plateau de l'Algerie over the roofs of the houses, and now
 that his alarm had subsided he could even watch with a certain degree of
 admiration the flight of the projectiles as they sailed over Sedan in a
 wide, majestic curve, leaving behind them a faint trail of smoke upon the
 air, like gigantic birds, invisible to mortal eye and to be traced only by
 the gray plumage shed by their pinions. At first it seemed to him quite
 evident that what damage had been done so far was the result of random
 practice by the Prussian gunners: they were not bombarding the city yet;
 then, upon further consideration, he was of opinion that their firing was
 intended as a response to the ineffectual fire of the few guns mounted on
 the fortifications of the place. Turning to the north he looked down from
 his position upon the extended and complex system of defenses of the
 citadel, the frowning curtains black with age, the green expanses of the
 turfed glacis, the stern bastions that reared their heads at geometrically
 accurate angles, prominent among them the three cyclopean salients, the
 Ecossais, the Grand Jardin, and la Rochette, while further to the west, in
 extension of the line, were Fort Nassau and Fort Palatinat, above the
 faubourg of Menil. The sight produced in him a melancholy impression of
 immensity and futility. Of what avail were they now against the powerful
 modern guns with their immense range? Besides, the works were not manned;
 cannon, ammunition, men were wanting. Some three weeks previously the
 governor had invited the citizens to organize and form a National Guard,
 and these volunteers were now doing duty as gunners; and thus it was that
 there were three guns in service at Palatinat, while at the Porte de Paris
 there may have been a half dozen. As they had only seven or eight rounds
 to each gun, however, the men husbanded their ammunition, limiting
 themselves to a shot every half hour, and that only as a sort of salve to
 their self-respect, for none of their missiles reached the enemy; all were
 lost in the meadows opposite them. Hence the enemy's batteries, disdainful
 of such small game, contemptuously pitched a shell at them from time to
 time, out of charity, as it were.
 </p>
 <p>
 Those batteries over across the river were objects of great interest to
 Delaherche. He was eagerly scanning the heights of la Marfee with his
 naked eye, when all at once he thought of the spy-glass with which he
 sometimes amused himself by watching the doings of his neighbors from the
 terrace. He ran downstairs and got it, returned and placed it in position,
 and as he was slowly sweeping the horizon and trees, fields, houses came
 within his range of vision, he lighted on that group of uniforms, at the
 angle of a pine wood, over the main battery at Frenois, of which Weiss had
 caught a glimpse from Bazeilles. To him, however, thanks to the excellence
 of his glass, it would have been no difficult matter to count the number
 of officers of the staff, so distinctly he made them out. Some of them
 were reclining carelessly on the grass, others were conversing in little
 groups, and in front of them all stood a solitary figure, a spare,
 well-proportioned man to appearances, in an unostentatious uniform, who
 yet asserted in some indefinable way his masterhood. It was the Prussian
 King, scarce half finger high, one of those miniature leaden toys that
 afford children such delight. Although he was not certain of this identity
 until later on the manufacturer found himself, by reason of some
 inexplicable attraction, constantly returning to that diminutive puppet,
 whose face, scarce larger than a pin's head, was but a pale point against
 the immense blue sky.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not midday yet, and since nine o'clock the master had been watching
 the movements, inexorable as fate, of his armies. Onward, ever onward,
 they swept, by roads traced for them in advance, completing the circle,
 slowly but surely closing in and enveloping Sedan in their living wall of
 men and guns. The army on his left, that had come up across the level
 plain of Donchery, was debouching still from the pass of Saint-Albert and,
 leaving Saint-Menges in its rear, was beginning to show its heads of
 columns at Fleigneux; and, in the rear of the XIth corps, then sharply
 engaged with General Douay's force, he could discern the Vth corps,
 availing itself of the shelter of the woods and advancing stealthily on
 Illy, while battery upon battery came wheeling into position, an
 ever-lengthening line of thundering guns, until the horizon was an
 unbroken ring of fire. On the right the army was now in undisputed
 possession of the valley of the Givonne; the XIIth corps had taken la
 Moncelle, the Guards had forced the passage of the stream at Daigny,
 compelling General Ducrot to seek the protection of the wood of la
 Garenne, and were pushing up the right bank, likewise in full march upon
 the plateau of Illy. Their task was almost done; one effort more, and up
 there at the north, among those barren fields, on the very verge of the
 dark forests of the Ardennes, the Crown Prince of Prussia would join hands
 with the Crown Prince of Saxony. To the south of Sedan the village of
 Bazeilles was lost to sight in the dense smoke of its burning houses, in
 the clouds of dun vapor that rose above the furious conflict.
 </p>
 <p>
 And tranquilly, ever since the morning, the King had been watching and
 waiting. An hour yet, two hours, it might be three, it mattered not; it
 was only a question of time. Wheel and pinion, cog and lever, were working
 in harmony, the great engine of destruction was in motion, and soon would
 have run its course. In the center of the immense horizon, beneath the
 deep vault of sunlit sky, the bounds of the battlefield were ever becoming
 narrower, the black swarms were converging, closing in on doomed Sedan.
 There were fiery reflexions in the windows of the city; to the left, in
 the direction of the Faubourg de la Cassine, it seemed as if a house was
 burning. And outside the circle of flame and smoke, in the fields no
 longer trodden by armed men, over by Donchery, over by Carignan, peace,
 warm and luminous, lay upon the land; the bright waters of the Meuse, the
 lusty trees rejoicing in their strength, the broad, verdant meadows, the
 fertile, well-kept farms, all rested peacefully beneath the fervid noonday
 sun.
 </p>
 <p>
 Turning to his staff, the King briefly called for information upon some
 point. It was the royal will to direct each move on the gigantic
 chessboard; to hold in the hollow of his hand the hosts who looked to him
 for guidance. At his left, a flock of swallows, affrighted by the noise of
 the cannonade, rose high in air, wheeled, and vanished in the south.

 IV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Between the city and Balan, Henriette got over the ground at a good, round
 pace. It was not yet nine o'clock; the broad footpath, bordered by gardens
 and pretty cottages, was as yet comparatively free, although as she
 approached the village it began to be more and more obstructed by flying
 citizens and moving troops. When she saw a great surge of the human tide
 advancing on her she hugged the walls and house-fronts, and by dint of
 address and perseverance slipped through, somehow. The fold of black lace
 that half concealed her fair hair and small, pale face, the sober gown
 that enveloped her slight form, made her an inconspicuous object among the
 throng; she went her way unnoticed by the by-passers, and nothing retarded
 her light, silent steps.
 </p>
 <p>
 At Balan, however, she found the road blocked by a regiment of infanterie
 de marine. It was a compact mass of men, drawn up under the tall trees
 that concealed them from the enemy's observation, awaiting orders. She
 raised herself on tiptoe, and could not see the end; still, she made
 herself as small as she could and attempted to worm her way through. The
 men shoved her with their elbows, and the butts of their muskets made
 acquaintance with her ribs; when she had advanced a dozen paces there was
 a chorus of shouts and angry protests. A captain turned on her and roughly
 cried:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hi, there, you woman! are you crazy? Where are you going?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am going to Bazeilles."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, to Bazeilles?"
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a shout of laughter. The soldiers pointed at her with their
 fingers; she was the object of their witticisms. The captain, also,
 greatly amused by the incident, had to have his joke.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You should take us along with you, my little dear, if you are going to
 Bazeilles. We were there a short while ago, and I am in hope that we shall
 go back there, but I can tell you that the temperature of the place is
 none too cool."
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am going to Bazeilles to look for my husband," Henriette declared, in
 her gentle voice, while her blue eyes shone with undiminished resolution.
 </p>
 <p>
 The laughter ceased; an old sergeant extricated her from the crowd that
 had collected around her, and forced her to retrace her steps.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor child, you see it is impossible to get through. Bazeilles is no
 place for you. You will find your husband by and by. Come, listen to
 reason!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had to obey, and stood aside beneath the trees, raising herself on her
 toes at every moment to peer before her, firm in her resolve to continue
 her journey as soon as she should be allowed to pass. She learned the
 condition of affairs from the conversation that went on around her. Some
 officers were criticising with great acerbity the order for the
 abandonment of Bazeilles, which had occurred at a quarter-past eight, at
 the time when General Ducrot, taking over the command from the marshal,
 had considered it best to concentrate the troops on the plateau of Illy.
 What made matters worse was, that the valley of the Givonne having fallen
 into the hands of the Germans through the premature retirement of the 1st
 corps, the 12th corps, which was even then sustaining a vigorous attack in
 front, was overlapped on its left flank. Now that General de Wimpffen had
 relieved General Ducrot, it seemed that the original plan was to be
 carried out. Orders had been received to retake Bazeilles at every cost,
 and drive the Bavarians into the Meuse. And so, in the ranks of that
 regiment that had been halted there in full retreat at the entrance of the
 village and ordered to resume the offensive, there was much bitter
 feeling, and angry words were rife. Was ever such stupidity heard of? to
 make them abandon a position, and immediately tell them to turn round and
 retake it from the enemy! They were willing enough to risk their life in
 the cause, but no one cared to throw it away for nothing!
 </p>
 <p>
 A body of mounted men dashed up the street and General de Wimpffen
 appeared among them, and raising himself erect on his stirrups, with
 flashing eyes, he shouted, in ringing tones:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Friends, we cannot retreat; it would be ruin to us all. And if we do have
 to retreat, it shall be on Carignan, and not on Mezieres. But we shall be
 victorious! You beat the enemy this morning; you will beat them again!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He galloped off on a road that conducted to la Moncelle. It was said that
 there had been a violent altercation between him and General Ducrot, each
 upholding his own plan, and decrying the plan of the other&mdash;one
 asserting that retreat by way of Mezieres had been impracticable all that
 morning; the other predicting that, unless they fell back on Illy, the
 army would be surrounded before night. And there was a great deal of
 bitter recrimination, each taxing the other with ignorance of the country
 and of the situation of the troops. The pity of it was that both were
 right.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Henriette, meantime, had made an encounter that caused her to forget
 her project for a moment. In some poor outcasts; stranded by the wayside,
 she had recognized a family of honest weavers from Bazeilles, father,
 mother, and three little girls, of whom the largest was only nine years
 old. They were utterly disheartened and forlorn, and so weary and footsore
 that they could go no further, and had thrown themselves down at the foot
 of a wall.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Alas! dear lady," the wife and mother said to Henriette, "we have lost
 our all. Our house&mdash;you know where our house stood on the Place de
 l'Eglise&mdash;well, a shell came and burned it. Why we and the children
 did not stay and share its fate I do not know&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 At these words the three little ones began to cry and sob afresh, while
 the mother, in distracted language, gave further details of the
 catastrophe.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The loom, I saw it burn like seasoned kindling wood, and the bed, the
 chairs and tables, they blazed like so much straw. And even the clock&mdash;yes,
 the poor old clock that I tried to save and could not."
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God! my God!" the man exclaimed, his eyes swimming with tears, "what
 is to become of us?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette endeavored to comfort them, but it was in a voice that quavered
 strangely.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You have been preserved to each other, you are safe and unharmed; your
 three little girls are left you. What reason have you to complain?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then she proceeded to question them to learn how matters stood in
 Bazeilles, whether they had seen her husband, in what state they had left
 her house, but in their half-dazed condition they gave conflicting
 answers. No, they had not seen M. Weiss. One of the little girls, however,
 declared that she had seen him, and that he was lying on the ground with a
 great hole in his head, whereon the father gave her a box on the ear,
 bidding her hold her tongue and not tell such lies to the lady. As for the
 house, they could say with certainty that it was intact at the time of
 their flight; they even remembered to have observed, as they passed it,
 that the doors and windows were tightly secured, as if it was quite
 deserted. At that time, moreover, the only foothold that the Bavarians had
 secured for themselves was in the Place de l'Eglise, and to carry the
 village they would have to fight for it, street by street, house by house.
 They must have been gaining ground since then, though; all Bazeilles was
 in flames by that time, like enough, and not a wall left standing, thanks
 to the fierceness of the assailants and the resolution of the defenders.
 And so the poor creatures went on, with trembling, affrighted gestures,
 evoking the horrid sights their eyes had seen and telling their dreadful
 tale of slaughter and conflagration and corpses lying in heaps upon the
 ground.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But my husband?" Henriette asked again.
 </p>
 <p>
 They made no answer, only continued to cover their face with their hands
 and sob. Her cruel anxiety, as she stood there erect, with no outward sign
 of weakness, was only evinced by a slight quivering of the lips. What was
 she to believe? Vainly she told herself the child was mistaken; her mental
 vision pictured her husband lying there dead before her in the street with
 a bullet wound in the head. Again, that house, so securely locked and
 bolted, was another source of alarm; why was it so? was he no longer in
 it? The conviction that he was dead sent an icy chill to her heart; but
 perhaps he was only wounded, perhaps he was breathing still; and so sudden
 and imperious was the need she felt of flying to his side that she would
 again have attempted to force her passage through the troops had not the
 bugles just then sounded the order for them to advance.
 </p>
 <p>
 The regiment was largely composed of raw, half-drilled recruits from
 Toulon, Brest, and Rochefort, men who had never fired a shot, but all that
 morning they had fought with a bravery and firmness that would not have
 disgraced veteran troops. They had not shown much aptitude for marching on
 the road from Rheims to Mouzon, weighted as they were with their
 unaccustomed burdens, but when they came to face the enemy their
 discipline and sense of duty made themselves felt, and notwithstanding the
 righteous anger that was in their hearts, the bugle had but to sound and
 they returned to brave the fire and encounter the foe. Three several times
 they had been promised a division to support them; it never came. They
 felt that they were deserted, sacrificed; it was the offering of their
 life that was demanded of them by those who, having first made them
 evacuate the place, were now sending them back into the fiery furnace of
 Bazeilles. And they knew it, and they gave their life, freely, without a
 murmur, closing up their ranks and leaving the shelter of the trees to
 meet afresh the storm of shell and bullets.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette gave a deep sigh of relief; at last they were about to move! She
 followed them, with the hope that she might enter the village unperceived
 in their rear, prepared to run with them should they take the
 double-quick. But they had scarcely begun to move when they came to a halt
 again. The projectiles were now falling thick and fast; to regain
 possession of Bazeilles it would be necessary to dispute every inch of the
 road, occupying the cross-streets, the houses and gardens on either side
 of the way. A brisk fire of musketry proceeded from the head of the
 column, the advance was irregular, by fits and starts, every petty
 obstacle entailed a delay of many minutes. She felt that she would never
 attain her end by remaining there at the rear of the column, waiting for
 it to fight its way through, and with prompt decision she bent her course
 to the right and took a path that led downward between two hedges to the
 meadows.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette's plan now was to reach Bazeilles by those broad levels that
 border the Meuse. She was not very clear about it in her mind, however,
 and continued to hasten onward in obedience to that blind instinct which
 had originally imparted to her its impulse. She had not gone far before
 she found herself standing and gazing in dismay at a miniature ocean which
 barred her further progress in that direction. It was the inundated
 fields, the low-lying lands that a measure of defense had converted into a
 lake, which had escaped her memory. For a single moment she thought of
 turning back; then, at the risk of leaving her shoes behind, she pushed
 on, hugging the bank, through the water that covered the grass and rose
 above her ankles. For a hundred yards her way, though difficult, was not
 impracticable; then she encountered a garden-wall directly in her front;
 the ground fell off sharply, and where the wall terminated the water was
 six feet deep. Her path was closed effectually; she clenched her little
 fists and had to summon up all her resolution to keep from bursting into
 tears. When the first shock of disappointment had passed over she made her
 way along the enclosure and found a narrow lane that pursued a tortuous
 course among the scattered houses. She believed that now her troubles were
 at an end, for she was acquainted with that labyrinth, that tangled maze
 of passages, which, to one who had the key to them, ended at the village.
 </p>
 <p>
 But the missiles seemed to be falling there even more thickly than
 elsewhere. Henriette stopped short in her tracks and all the blood in her
 body seemed to flow back upon her heart at a frightful detonation, so
 close that she could feel the wind upon her cheek. A shell had exploded
 directly before her and only a few yards away. She turned her head and
 scrutinized for a moment the heights of the left bank, above which the
 smoke from the German batteries was curling upward; she saw what she must
 do, and when she started on her way again it was with eyes fixed on the
 horizon, watching for the shells in order to avoid them. There was method
 in the rash daring of her proceeding, and all the brave tranquillity that
 the prudent little housewife had at her command. She was not going to be
 killed if she could help it; she wished to find her husband and bring him
 back with her, that they might yet have many days of happy life together.
 The projectiles still came tumbling frequently as ever; she sped along
 behind walls, made a cover of boundary stones, availed herself of every
 slight depression. But presently she came to an open space, a bit of
 unprotected road where splinters and fragments of exploded shells lay
 thick, and she was watching behind a shed for a chance to make a dash when
 she perceived, emerging from a sort of cleft in the ground in front of
 her, a human head and two bright eyes that peered about inquisitively. It
 was a little, bare-footed, ten-year-old boy, dressed in a shirt and ragged
 trousers, an embryonic tramp, who was watching the battle with huge
 delight. At every report his small black beady eyes would snap and
 sparkle, and he jubilantly shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh my! aint it bully!&mdash;Look out, there comes another one! don't
 stir! Boom! that was a rouser!&mdash;Don't stir! don't stir!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And each time there came a shell he dived to the bottom of his hole, then
 reappeared, showing his dirty, elfish face, until it was time to duck
 again.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette now noticed that the projectiles all came from Liry, while the
 batteries at Pont-Maugis and Noyers were confining their attention to
 Balan. At each discharge she could see the smoke distinctly, immediately
 afterward she heard the scream of the shell, succeeded by the explosion.
 Just then the gunners afforded them a brief respite; the bluish haze above
 the heights drifted slowly away upon the wind.
 </p>
 <p>
 "They've stopped to take a drink, you can go your money on it," said the
 urchin. "Quick, quick, give me your hand! Now's the time to skip!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He took her by the hand and dragged her along with him, and in this way
 they crossed the open together, side by side, running for dear life, with
 head and shoulders down. When they were safely ensconced behind a stack
 that opportunely offered its protection at the end of their course and
 turned to look behind them, they beheld another shell come rushing through
 the air and alight upon the shed at the very spot they had occupied so
 lately. The crash was fearful; the shed was knocked to splinters. The
 little ragamuffin considered that a capital joke, and fairly danced with
 glee.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bravo, hit 'em agin! that's the way to do it!&mdash;But it was time for
 us to skip, though, wasn't it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But again Henriette struck up against insurmountable obstacles in the
 shape of hedges and garden-walls, that offered absolutely no outlet. Her
 irrepressible companion, still wearing his broad grin and remarking that
 where there was a will there was a way, climbed to the coping of a wall
 and assisted her to scale it. On reaching the further side they found
 themselves in a kitchen garden among beds of peas and string-beans and
 surrounded by fences on every side; their sole exit was through the little
 cottage of the gardener. The boy led the way, swinging his arms and
 whistling unconcernedly, with an expression on his face of most profound
 indifference. He pushed open a door that admitted him to a bedroom, from
 which he passed on into another room, where there was an old woman,
 apparently the only living being upon the premises. She was standing by a
 table, in a sort of dazed stupor; she looked at the two strangers who thus
 unceremoniously made a highway of her dwelling, but addressed them no
 word, nor did they speak a word to her. They vanished as quickly as they
 had appeared, emerging by the exit opposite their entrance upon an alley
 that they followed for a moment. After that there were other difficulties
 to be surmounted, and thus they went on for more than half a mile, scaling
 walls, struggling through hedges, availing themselves of every short cut
 that offered, it might be the door of a stable or the window of a cottage,
 as the exigencies of the case demanded. Dogs howled mournfully; they had a
 narrow escape from being run down by a cow that was plunging along, wild
 with terror. It seemed as if they must be approaching the village,
 however; there was an odor of burning wood in the air, and momentarily
 volumes of reddish smoke, like veils of finest gauze floating in the wind,
 passed athwart the sun and obscured his light.
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once the urchin came to a halt and planted himself in front of
 Henriette.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I say, lady, tell us where you're going, will you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You can see very well where I am going; to Bazeilles."
 </p>
 <p>
 He gave a low whistle of astonishment, following it up with the shrill
 laugh of the careless vagabond to whom nothing is sacred, who is not
 particular upon whom or what he launches his irreverent gibes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "To Bazeilles&mdash;oh, no, I guess not; I don't think my business lies
 that way&mdash;I have another engagement. Bye-bye, ta-ta!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He turned on his heel and was off like a shot, and she was none the wiser
 as to whence he came or whither he went. She had found him in a hole, she
 had lost sight of him at the corner of a wall, and never was she to set
 eyes on him again.
 </p>
 <p>
 When she was alone again Henriette experienced a strange sensation of
 fear. He had been no protection to her, that scrubby urchin, but his
 chatter had been a distraction; he had kept her spirits up by his way of
 making game of everything, as if it was all one huge raree show. Now she
 was beginning to tremble, her strength was failing her, she, who by nature
 was so courageous. The shells no longer fell around her: the Germans had
 ceased firing on Bazeilles, probably to avoid killing their own men, who
 were now masters of the village; but within the last few minutes she had
 heard the whistling of bullets, that peculiar sound like the buzzing of a
 bluebottle fly, that she recognized by having heard it described. There
 was such a raging, roaring clamor rising to the heavens in the distance,
 the confused uproar of other sounds was so violent, that in it she failed
 to distinguish the report of musketry. As she was turning the corner of a
 house there was a deadened thud close at her ear, succeeded by the sound
 of falling plaster, which brought her to a sudden halt; it was a bullet
 that had struck the facade. She was pale as death, and asked herself if
 her courage would be sufficient to carry her through to the end; and
 before she had time to frame an answer, she received what seemed to her a
 blow from a hammer upon her forehead, and sank, stunned, upon her knees.
 It was a spent ball that had ricocheted and struck her a little above the
 left eyebrow with sufficient force to raise an ugly contusion. When she
 came to, raising her hands to her forehead, she withdrew them covered with
 blood. But the pressure of her fingers had assured her that the bone
 beneath was uninjured, and she said aloud, encouraging herself by the
 sound of her own voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is nothing, it is nothing. Come, I am not afraid; no, no! I am not
 afraid."
 </p>
 <p>
 And it was the truth; she arose, and from that time walked amid the storm
 of bullets with absolute indifference, like one whose soul is parted from
 his body, who reasons not, who gives his life. She marched straight
 onward, with head erect, no longer seeking to shelter herself, and if she
 struck out at a swifter pace it was only that she might reach her
 appointed end more quickly. The death-dealing missiles pattered on the
 road before and behind her; twenty times they were near taking her life;
 she never noticed them. At last she was at Bazeilles, and struck
 diagonally across a field of lucerne in order to regain the road, the main
 street that traversed the village. Just as she turned into it she cast her
 eyes to the right, and there, some two hundred paces from her, beheld her
 house in a blaze. The flames were invisible against the bright sunlight;
 the roof had already fallen in in part, the windows were belching dense
 clouds of black smoke. She could restrain herself no longer, and ran with
 all her strength.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ever since eight o'clock Weiss, abandoned by the retiring troops, had been
 a self-made prisoner there. His return to Sedan had become an
 impossibility, for the Bavarians, immediately upon the withdrawal of the
 French, had swarmed down from the park of Montivilliers and occupied the
 road. He was alone and defenseless, save for his musket and what few
 cartridges were left him, when he beheld before his door a little band of
 soldiers, ten in number, abandoned, like himself, and parted from their
 comrades, looking about them for a place where they might defend
 themselves and sell their lives dearly. He ran downstairs to admit them,
 and thenceforth the house had a garrison, a lieutenant, corporal and eight
 men, all bitterly inflamed against the enemy, and resolved never to
 surrender.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, Laurent, you here!" he exclaimed, surprised to recognize among the
 soldiers a tall, lean young man, who held in his hand a musket, doubtless
 taken from some corpse.
 </p>
 <p>
 Laurent was dressed in jacket and trousers of blue cloth; he was helper to
 a gardener of the neighborhood, and had lately lost his mother and his
 wife, both of whom had been carried off by the same insidious fever.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And why shouldn't I be?" he replied. "All I have is my skin, and I'm
 willing to give that. And then I am not such a bad shot, you know, and it
 will be just fun for me to blaze away at those rascals and knock one of
 'em over every time."
 </p>
 <p>
 The lieutenant and the corporal had already begun to make an inspection of
 the premises. There was nothing to be done on the ground floor; all they
 did was to push the furniture against the door and windows in such a way
 as to form as secure a barricade as possible. After attending to that they
 proceeded to arrange a plan for the defense of the three small rooms of
 the first floor and the open attic, making no change, however, in the
 measures that had been already taken by Weiss, the protection of the
 windows by mattresses, the loopholes cut here and there in the slats of
 the blinds. As the lieutenant was leaning from the window to take a survey
 of their surroundings, he heard the wailing cry of a child.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is that?" he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss looked from the window, and, in the adjoining dyehouse, beheld the
 little sick boy, Charles, his scarlet face resting on the white pillow,
 imploringly begging his mother to bring him a drink: his mother, who lay
 dead across the threshold, beyond hearing or answering. With a sorrowful
 expression he replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is a poor little child next door, there, crying for his mother, who
 was killed by a Prussian shell."
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i>" muttered Laurent, "how are they ever going to
 pay for all these things!"
 </p>
 <p>
 As yet only a few random shots had struck the front of the house. Weiss
 and the lieutenant, accompanied by the corporal and two men, had ascended
 to the attic, where they were in better position to observe the road, of
 which they had an oblique view as far as the Place de l'Eglise. The square
 was now occupied by the Bavarians, but any further advance was attended by
 difficulties that made them very circumspect. A handful of French
 soldiers, posted at the mouth of a narrow lane, held them in check for
 nearly a quarter of an hour, with a fire so rapid and continuous that the
 dead bodies lay in piles. The next obstacle they encountered was a house
 on the opposite corner, which also detained them some time before they
 could get possession of it. At one time a woman, with a musket in her
 hands, was seen through the smoke, firing from one of the windows. It was
 the abode of a baker, and a few soldiers were there in addition to the
 regular occupants; and when the house was finally carried there was a
 hoarse shout: "No quarter!" a surging, struggling, vociferating throng
 poured from the door and rolled across the street to the dead-wall
 opposite, and in the raging torrent were seen the woman's skirt, the
 jacket of a man, the white hairs of the grandfather; then came the crash
 of a volley of musketry, and the wall was splashed with blood from base to
 coping. This was a point on which the Germans were inexorable; everyone
 caught with arms in his hands and not belonging to some uniformed
 organization was shot without the formality of a trial, as having violated
 the law of nations. They were enraged at the obstinate resistance offered
 them by the village, and the frightful loss they had sustained during the
 five hours' conflict provoked them to the most atrocious reprisals. The
 gutters ran red with blood, the piled dead in the streets formed
 barricades, some of the more open places were charnel-houses, from whose
 depths rose the death-rattle of men in their last agony. And in every
 house that they had to carry by assault in this way men were seen
 distributing wisps of lighted straw, others ran to and fro with blazing
 torches, others smeared the walls and furniture with petroleum; soon whole
 streets were burning, Bazeilles was in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
 And now Weiss's was the only house in the central portion of the village
 that still continued to hold out, preserving its air of menace, like some
 stern citadel determined not to yield.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look out! here they come!" shouted the lieutenant.
 </p>
 <p>
 A simultaneous discharge from the attic and the first floor laid low three
 of the Bavarians, who had come forward hugging the walls. The remainder of
 the body fell back and posted themselves under cover wherever the street
 offered facilities, and the siege of the house began; the bullets pelted
 on the front like rattling hail. For nearly ten minutes the fusillade
 continued without cessation, damaging the stucco, but not doing much
 mischief otherwise, until one of the men whom the lieutenant had taken
 with him to the garret was so imprudent as to show himself at a window,
 when a bullet struck him square in the forehead, killing him instantly. It
 was plain that whoever exposed himself would do so at peril of his life.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Doggone it! there's one gone!" growled the lieutenant. "Be careful, will
 you; there's not enough of us that we can afford to let ourselves be
 killed for the fun of it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had taken a musket and was firing away like the rest of them from
 behind the protection of a shutter, at the same time watching and
 encouraging his men. It was Laurent, the gardener's helper, however, who
 more than all the others excited his wonder and admiration. Kneeling on
 the floor, with his chassepot peering out of the narrow aperture of a
 loophole, he never fired until absolutely certain of his aim; he even told
 in advance where he intended hitting his living target.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That little officer in blue that you see down there, in the heart.&mdash;That
 other fellow, the tall, lean one, between the eyes.&mdash;I don't like the
 looks of that fat man with the red beard; I think I'll let him have it in
 the stomach."
 </p>
 <p>
 And each time his man went down as if struck by lightning, hit in the very
 spot he had mentioned, and he continued to fire at intervals, coolly,
 without haste, there being no necessity for hurrying himself, as he
 remarked, since it would require too long a time to kill them all in that
 way.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! if I had but my eyes!" Weiss impatiently exclaimed. He had broken his
 spectacles a while before, to his great sorrow. He had his double
 eye-glass still, but the perspiration was rolling down his face in such
 streams that it was impossible to keep it on his nose. His usual calm
 collectedness was entirely lost in his over-mastering passion; and thus,
 between his defective vision and his agitated nerves, many of his shots
 were wasted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't hurry so, it is only throwing away powder," said Laurent. "Do you
 see that man who has lost his helmet, over yonder by the grocer's shop?
 Well, now draw a bead on him,&mdash;carefully, don't hurry. That's
 first-rate! you have broken his paw for him and made him dance a jig in
 his own blood."
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss, rather pale in the face, gave a look at the result of his
 marksmanship.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Put him out of his misery," he said.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, waste a cartridge! Not, much. Better save it for another of 'em."
 </p>
 <p>
 The besiegers could not have failed to notice the remarkable practice of
 the invisible sharpshooter in the attic. Whoever of them showed himself in
 the open was certain to remain there. They therefore brought up
 re-enforcements and placed them in position, with instructions to maintain
 an unremitting fire upon the roof of the building. It was not long before
 the attic became untenable; the slates were perforated as if they had been
 tissue paper, the bullets found their way to every nook and corner,
 buzzing and humming as if the room had been invaded by a swarm of angry
 bees. Death stared them all in the face if they remained there longer.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We will go downstairs," said the lieutenant. "We can hold the first floor
 for awhile yet." But as he was making for the ladder a bullet struck him
 in the groin and he fell. "Too late, doggone it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss and Laurent, aided by the remaining soldiers, carried him below,
 notwithstanding his vehement protests; he told them not to waste their
 time on him, his time had come; he might as well die upstairs as down. He
 was still able to be of service to them, however, when they had laid him
 on a bed in a room of the first floor, by advising them what was best to
 do.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Fire into the mass," he said; "don't stop to take aim. They are too
 cowardly to risk an advance unless they see your fire begin to slacken."
 </p>
 <p>
 And so the siege of the little house went on as if it was to last for
 eternity. Twenty times it seemed as if it must be swept away bodily by the
 storm of iron that beat upon it, and each time, as the smoke drifted away,
 it was seen amid the sulphurous blasts, torn, pierced, mangled, but erect
 and menacing, spitting fire and lead with undiminished venom from each one
 of its orifices. The assailants, furious that they should be detained for
 such length of time and lose so many men before such a hovel, yelled and
 fired wildly in the distance, but had not courage to attempt to carry the
 lower floor by a rush.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look out!" shouted the corporal, "there is a shutter about to fall!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The concentrated fire had torn one of the inside blinds from its hinges,
 but Weiss darted forward and pushed a wardrobe before the window, and
 Laurent was enabled to continue his operations under cover. One of the
 soldiers was lying at his feet with his jaw broken, losing blood freely.
 Another received a bullet in his chest, and dragged himself over to the
 wall, where he lay gasping in protracted agony, while convulsive movements
 shook his frame at intervals. They were but eight, now, all told, not
 counting the lieutenant, who, too weak to speak, his back supported by the
 headboard of the bed, continued to give his directions by signs. As had
 been the case with the attic, the three rooms of the first floor were
 beginning to be untenable, for the mangled mattresses no longer afforded
 protection against the missiles; at every instant the plaster fell in
 sheets from the walls and ceiling, and the furniture was in process of
 demolition: the sides of the wardrobe yawned as if they had been cloven by
 an ax. And worse still, the ammunition was nearly exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's too bad!" grumbled Laurent; "just when everything was going so
 beautifully!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But suddenly Weiss was struck with an idea.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Wait!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had thought of the dead soldier up in the garret above, and climbed up
 the ladder to search for the cartridges he must have about him. A wide
 space of the roof had been crushed in; he saw the blue sky, a patch of
 bright, wholesome light that made him start. Not wishing to be killed, he
 crawled over the floor on his hands and knees, then, when he had the
 cartridges in his possession, some thirty of them, he made haste down
 again as fast his legs could carry him.
 </p>
 <p>
 Downstairs, as he was sharing his newly acquired treasure with the
 gardener's lad, a soldier uttered a piercing cry and sank to his knees.
 They were but seven; and presently they were but six, a bullet having
 entered the corporal's head at the eye and lodged in the brain.
 </p>
 <p>
 From that time on, Weiss had no distinct consciousness of what was going
 on around him; he and the five others continued to blaze away like
 lunatics, expending their cartridges, with not the faintest idea in their
 heads that there could be such a thing as surrender. In the three small
 rooms the floor was strewn with fragments of the broken furniture. Ingress
 and egress were barred by the corpses that lay before the doors; in one
 corner a wounded man kept up a pitiful wail that was frightful to hear.
 Every inch of the floor was slippery with blood; a thin stream of blood
 from the attic was crawling lazily down the stairs. And the air was scarce
 respirable, an air thick and hot with sulphurous fumes, heavy with smoke,
 filled with an acrid, nauseating dust; a darkness dense as that of night,
 through which darted the red flame-tongues of the musketry.
 </p>
 <p>
 "By God's thunder!" cried Weiss, "they are bringing up artillery!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true. Despairing of ever reducing that handful of madmen, who had
 consumed so much of their time, the Bavarians had run up a gun to the
 corner of the Place de l'Eglise, and were putting it into position;
 perhaps they would be allowed to pass when they should have knocked the
 house to pieces with their solid shot. And the honor there was to them in
 the proceeding, the gun trained on them down there in the square, excited
 the bitter merriment of the besieged; the utmost intensity of scorn was in
 their gibes. Ah! the cowardly <i>bougres</i>, with their artillery!
 Kneeling in his old place still, Laurent carefully adjusted his aim and
 each time picked off a gunner, so that the service of the piece became
 impossible, and it was five or six minutes before they fired their first
 shot. It ranged high, moreover, and only clipped away a bit of the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
 But the end was now at hand. It was all in vain that they searched the
 dead men's belts; there was not a single cartridge left. With vacillating
 steps and haggard faces the six groped around the room, seeking what heavy
 objects they might find to hurl from the windows upon their enemies. One
 of them showed himself at the casement, vociferating insults, and shaking
 his fist; instantly he was pierced by a dozen bullets; and there remained
 but five. What were they to do? go down and endeavor to make their escape
 by way of the garden and the meadows? The question was never answered, for
 at that moment a tumult arose below, a furious mob came tumbling up the
 stairs: it was the Bavarians, who had at last thought of turning the
 position by breaking down the back door and entering the house by that
 way. For a brief moment a terrible hand-to-hand conflict raged in the
 small rooms among the dead bodies and the debris of the furniture. One of
 the soldiers had his chest transfixed by a bayonet thrust, the two others
 were made prisoners, while the attitude of the lieutenant, who had given
 up the ghost, was that of one about to give an order, his mouth open, his
 arm raised aloft.
 </p>
 <p>
 While these things were occurring an officer, a big, flaxen-haired man,
 carrying a revolver in his hand, whose bloodshot eyes seemed bursting from
 their sockets, had caught sight of Weiss and Laurent, both in their
 civilian attire; he roared at them in French:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who are you, you fellows? and what are you doing here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, glancing at their faces, black with powder-stains, he saw how
 matters stood, he heaped insult and abuse on them in guttural German, in a
 voice that shook with anger. Already he had raised his revolver and was
 about to send a bullet into their heads, when the soldiers of his command
 rushed in, seized Laurent and Weiss, and hustled them out to the
 staircase. The two men were borne along like straws upon a mill-race
 amidst that seething human torrent, under whose pressure they were hurled
 from out the door and sent staggering, stumbling across the street to the
 opposite wall amid a chorus of execration that drowned the sound of their
 officers' voices. Then, for a space of two or three minutes, while the big
 fair-haired officer was endeavoring to extricate them in order to proceed
 with their execution, an opportunity was afforded them to raise themselves
 erect and look about them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Other houses had taken fire; Bazeilles was now a roaring, blazing furnace.
 Flames had begun to appear at the tall windows of the church and were
 creeping upward toward the roof. Some soldiers who were driving a
 venerable lady from her home had compelled her to furnish the matches with
 which to fire her own beds and curtains. Lighted by blazing brands and fed
 by petroleum in floods, fires were rising and spreading in every quarter;
 it was no longer civilized warfare, but a conflict of savages, maddened by
 the long protracted strife, wreaking vengeance for their dead, their heaps
 of dead, upon whom they trod at every step they took. Yelling, shouting
 bands traversed the streets amid the scurrying smoke and falling cinders,
 swelling the hideous uproar into which entered sounds of every kind:
 shrieks, groans, the rattle of musketry, the crash of falling walls. Men
 could scarce see one another; great livid clouds drifted athwart the sun
 and obscured his light, bearing with them an intolerable stench of soot
 and blood, heavy with the abominations of the slaughter. In every quarter
 the work of death and destruction still went on: the human brute
 unchained, the imbecile wrath, the mad fury, of man devouring his brother
 man.
 </p>
 <p>
 And Weiss beheld his house burn before his eyes. Some soldiers had applied
 the torch, others fed the flame by throwing upon it the fragments of the
 wrecked furniture. The <i>rez-de-chaussee</i> was quickly in a blaze, the
 smoke poured in dense black volumes from the wounds in the front and roof.
 But now the dyehouse adjoining was also on fire, and horrible to relate,
 the voice of little Charles, lying on his bed delirious with fever, could
 be heard through the crackling of the flames, beseeching his mother to
 bring him a draught of water, while the skirts of the wretched woman who,
 with her disfigured face, lay across the door-sill, were even then
 beginning to kindle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Mamma, mamma, I am thirsty! Mamma, bring me a drink of water&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 The weak, faint voice was drowned in the roar of the conflagration; the
 cheering of the victors rose on the air in the distance.
 </p>
 <p>
 But rising above all other sounds, dominating the universal clamor, a
 terrible cry was heard. It was Henriette, who had reached the place at
 last, and now beheld her husband, backed up against the wall, facing a
 platoon of men who were loading their muskets.
 </p>
 <p>
 She flew to him and threw her arms about his neck.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God! what is it! They cannot be going to kill you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Weiss looked at her with stupid, unseeing eyes. She! his wife, so long the
 object of his desire, so fondly idolized! A great shudder passed through
 his frame and he awoke to consciousness of his situation. What had he
 done? why had he remained there, firing at the enemy, instead of returning
 to her side, as he had promised he would do? It all flashed upon him now,
 as the darkness is illuminated by the lightning's glare: he had wrecked
 their happiness, they were to be parted, forever parted. Then he noticed
 the blood upon her forehead.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you hurt?" he asked. "You were mad to come&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She interrupted him with an impatient gesture.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never mind me; it is a mere scratch. But you, you! why are you here? They
 shall not kill you; I will not suffer it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The officer, who was endeavoring to clear the road in order to give the
 firing party the requisite room, came up on hearing the sound of voices,
 and beholding a woman with her arms about the neck of one of his
 prisoners, exclaimed loudly in French:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, come, none of this nonsense here! Whence come you? What is your
 business here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give me my husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, is he your husband, that man? His sentence is pronounced; the law
 must take its course."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give me my husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, be rational. Stand aside; we do not wish to harm you."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give me my husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 Perceiving the futility of arguing with her, the officer was about to give
 orders to remove her forcibly from the doomed man's arms when Laurent, who
 until then had maintained an impassive silence, ventured to interfere.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, Captain, I am the man who killed so many of your men; go ahead
 and shoot me&mdash;that will be all right, especially as I have neither
 chick nor child in all the world. But this gentleman's case is different;
 he is a married man, don't you see. Come, now, let him go; then you can
 settle my business as soon as you choose."
 </p>
 <p>
 Beside himself with anger, the captain screamed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is all this lingo? Are you trying to make game of me? Come, step out
 here, some one of you fellows, and take away this woman!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had to repeat his order in German, whereon a soldier came forward from
 the ranks, a short stocky Bavarian, with an enormous head surrounded by a
 bristling forest of red hair and beard, beneath which all that was to be
 seen were a pair of big blue eyes and a massive nose. He was besmeared
 with blood, a hideous spectacle, like nothing so much as some fierce,
 hairy denizen of the woods, emerging from his cavern and licking his
 chops, still red with the gore of the victims whose bones he has been
 crunching.
 </p>
 <p>
 With a heart-rending cry Henriette repeated:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give me my husband, or let me die with him."
 </p>
 <p>
 This seemed to cause the cup of the officer's exasperation to overrun; he
 thumped himself violently on the chest, declaring that he was no
 executioner, that he would rather die than harm a hair of an innocent
 head. There was nothing against her; he would cut off his right hand
 rather than do her an injury. And then he repeated his order that she be
 taken away.
 </p>
 <p>
 As the Bavarian came up to carry out his instructions Henriette tightened
 her clasp on Weiss's neck, throwing all her strength into her frantic
 embrace.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, my love! Keep me with you, I beseech you; let me die with you&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Big tears were rolling down his cheeks as, without answering, he
 endeavored to loosen the convulsive clasp of the fingers of the poor
 creature he loved so dearly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You love me no longer, then, that you wish to die without me. Hold me,
 keep me, do not let them take me. They will weary at last, and will kill
 us together."
 </p>
 <p>
 He had loosened one of the little hands, and carried it to his lips and
 kissed it, working all the while to make the other release its hold.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no, it shall not be! I will not leave thy bosom; they shall pierce my
 heart before reaching thine. I will not survive&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But at last, after a long struggle, he held both the hands in his. Then he
 broke the silence that he had maintained until then, uttering one single
 word:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell, dear wife."
 </p>
 <p>
 And with his own hands he placed her in the arms of the Bavarian, who
 carried her away. She shrieked and struggled, while the soldier, probably
 with intent to soothe her, kept pouring in her ear an uninterrupted stream
 of words in unmelodious German. And, having freed her head, looking over
 the shoulder of the man, she beheld the end.
 </p>
 <p>
 It lasted not five seconds. Weiss, whose eye-glass had slipped from its
 position in the agitation of their parting, quickly replaced it upon his
 nose, as if desirous to look death in the face. He stepped back and placed
 himself against the wall, and the face of the self-contained, strong young
 man, as he stood there in his tattered coat, was sublimely beautiful in
 its expression of tranquil courage. Laurent, who stood beside him, had
 thrust his hands deep down into his pockets. The cold cruelty of the
 proceeding disgusted him; it seemed to him that they could not be far
 removed from savagery who could thus slaughter men before the eyes of
 their wives. He drew himself up, looked them square in the face, and in a
 tone of deepest contempt expectorated:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Dirty pigs!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The officer raised his sword; the signal was succeeded by a crashing
 volley, and the two men sank to the ground, an inert mass, the gardener's
 lad upon his face, the other, the accountant, upon his side, lengthwise of
 the wall. The frame of the latter, before he expired, contracted in a
 supreme convulsion, the eyelids quivered, the mouth opened as if he was
 about to speak. The officer came up and stirred him with his foot, to make
 sure that he was really dead.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette had seen the whole: the fading eyes that sought her in death,
 the last struggle of the strong man in agony, the brutal boot spurning the
 corpse. And while the Bavarian still held her in his arms, conveying her
 further and further from the object of her love, she uttered no cry; she
 set her teeth, in silent fury, into what was nearest: a human hand, it
 chanced to be. The soldier gave vent to a howl of anguish and dashed her
 to the ground; raising his uninjured fist above her head he was on the
 point of braining her. And for a moment their faces were in contact; she
 experienced a feeling of intensest loathing for the monster, and that
 blood-stained hair and beard, those blue eyes, dilated and brimming with
 hate and rage, were destined to remain forever indelibly imprinted on her
 memory.
 </p>
 <p>
 In after days Henriette could never account distinctly to herself for the
 time immediately succeeding these events. She had but one desire: to
 return to the spot where her loved one had died, take possession of his
 remains, and watch and weep over them; but, as in an evil dream, obstacles
 of every sort arose before her and barred the way. First a heavy infantry
 fire broke out afresh, and there was great activity among the German
 troops who were holding Bazeilles; it was due to the arrival of the
 infanterie de marine and other regiments that had been despatched from
 Balan to regain possession of the village, and the battle commenced to
 rage again with the utmost fury. The young woman, in company with a band
 of terrified citizens, was swept away to the left into a dark alley. The
 result of the conflict could not remain long doubtful, however; it was too
 late to reconquer the abandoned positions. For near half an hour the
 infantry struggled against superior numbers and faced death with splendid
 bravery, but the enemy's strength was constantly increasing, their
 re-enforcements were pouring in from every direction, the roads, the
 meadows, the park of Montivilliers; no force at our command could have
 dislodged them from the position, so dearly bought, where they had left
 thousands of their bravest. Destruction and devastation now had done their
 work; the place was a shambles, disgraceful to humanity, where mangled
 forms lay scattered among smoking ruins, and poor Bazeilles, having
 drained the bitter cup, went up at last in smoke and flame.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette turned and gave one last look at her little house, whose floors
 fell in even as she gazed, sending myriads of little sparks whirling gayly
 upward on the air. And there, before her, prone at the wall's foot, she
 saw her husband's corpse, and in her despair and grief would fain have
 returned to him, but just then another crowd came up and surged around
 her, the bugles were sounding the signal to retire, she was borne away,
 she knew not how, among the retreating troops. Her faculty of
 self-guidance left her; she was as a bit of flotsam swept onward by the
 eddying human tide that streamed along the way. And that was all she could
 remember until she became herself again and found she was at Balan, among
 strangers, her head reclined upon a table in a kitchen, weeping.

 V.

 <p>
 It was nearly ten o'clock up on the Plateau de l'Algerie, and still the
 men of Beaudoin's company were resting supine, among the cabbages, in the
 field whence they had not budged since early morning. The cross fire from
 the batteries on Hattoy and the peninsula of Iges was hotter than ever; it
 had just killed two more of their number, and there were no orders for
 them to advance. Were they to stay there and be shelled all day, without a
 chance to see anything of the fighting?
 </p>
 <p>
 They were even denied the relief of discharging their chassepots. Captain
 Beaudoin had at last put his foot down and stopped the firing, that
 senseless fusillade against the little wood in front of them, which seemed
 entirely deserted by the Prussians. The heat was stifling; it seemed to
 them that they should roast, stretched there on the ground under the
 blazing sky.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was alarmed, on turning to look at Maurice, to see that he had
 declined his head and was lying, with closed eyes, apparently inanimate,
 his cheek against the bare earth. He was very pale, there was no sign of
 life in his face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo there! what's the matter?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice was only sleeping. The mental strain, conjointly with his
 fatigue, had been too much for him, in spite of the dangers that menaced
 them at every moment. He awoke with a start and stared about him, and the
 peace that slumber had left in his wide-dilated eyes was immediately
 supplanted by a look of startled affright as it dawned on him where he
 was. He had not the remotest idea how long he had slept; all he knew was
 that the state from which he had been recalled to the horrors of the
 battlefield was one of blessed oblivion and tranquillity.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo! that's funny; I must have been asleep!" he murmured. "Ah! it has
 done me good."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true that he suffered less from that pressure about his temples and
 at his heart, that horrible constriction that seems as if it would crush
 one's bones. He chaffed Lapoulle, who had manifested much uneasiness since
 the disappearance of Chouteau and Loubet and spoke of going to look for
 them. A capital idea! so he might get away and hide behind a tree, and
 smoke a pipe! Pache thought that the surgeons had detained them at the
 ambulance, where there was a scarcity of sick-bearers. That was a job that
 he had no great fancy for, to go around under fire and collect the
 wounded! And haunted by a lingering superstition of the country where he
 was born, he added that it was unlucky to touch a corpse; it brought
 death.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Shut up, confound you!" roared Lieutenant Rochas. "Who is going to die?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Colonel de Vineuil, sitting his tall horse, turned his head and gave a
 smile, the first that had been seen on his face that morning. Then he
 resumed his statue-like attitude, waiting for orders as impassively as
 ever under the tumbling shells.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's attention was attracted to the sick-bearers, whose movements he
 watched with interest as they searched for wounded men among the
 depressions of the ground. At the end of a sunken road, and protected by a
 low ridge not far from their position, a flying ambulance of first aid had
 been established, and its emissaries had begun to explore the plateau. A
 tent was quickly erected, while from the hospital van the attendants
 extracted the necessary supplies; compresses, bandages, linen, and the few
 indispensable instruments required for the hasty dressings they gave
 before dispatching the patients to Sedan, which they did as rapidly as
 they could secure wagons, the supply of which was limited. There was an
 assistant surgeon in charge, with two subordinates of inferior rank under
 him. In all the army none showed more gallantry and received less
 acknowledgment than the litter-bearers. They could be seen all over the
 field in their gray uniform, with the distinctive red badge on their cap
 and on their arm, courageously risking their lives and unhurriedly pushing
 forward through the thickest of the fire to the spots where men had been
 seen to fall. At times they would creep on hands and knees: would always
 take advantage of a hedge or ditch, or any shelter that was afforded by
 the conformation of the ground, never exposing themselves unnecessarily
 out of bravado. When at last they reached the fallen men their painful
 task commenced, which was made more difficult and protracted by the fact
 that many of the subjects had fainted, and it was hard to tell whether
 they were alive or dead. Some lay face downward with their mouths in a
 pool of blood, in danger of suffocating, others had bitten the ground
 until their throats were choked with dry earth, others, where a shell had
 fallen among a group, were a confused, intertwined heap of mangled limbs
 and crushed trunks. With infinite care and patience the bearers would go
 through the tangled mass, separating the living from the dead, arranging
 their limbs and raising the head to give them air, cleansing the face as
 well as they could with the means at their command. Each of them carried a
 bucket of cool water, which he had to use very savingly. And Maurice could
 see them thus engaged, often for minutes at a time, kneeling by some man
 whom they were trying to resuscitate, waiting for him to show some sign of
 life.
 </p>
 <p>
 He watched one of them, some fifty yards away to the left, working over
 the wound of a little soldier from the sleeve of whose tunic a thin stream
 of blood was trickling, drop by drop. The man of the red cross discovered
 the source of the hemorrhage and finally checked it by compressing the
 artery. In urgent cases, like that of the little soldier, they rendered
 these partial attentions, locating fractures, bandaging and immobilizing
 the limbs so as to reduce the danger of transportation. And the
 transportation, even, was an affair that called for a great deal of
 judgment and ingenuity; they assisted those who could walk, and carried
 others, either in their arms, like little children, or pickaback when the
 nature of the hurt allowed it; at other times they united in groups of
 two, three, or four, according to the requirements of the case, and made a
 chair by joining their hands, or carried the patient off by his legs and
 shoulders in a recumbent posture. In addition to the stretchers provided
 by the medical department there were all sorts of temporary makeshifts,
 such as the stretchers improvised from knapsack straps and a couple of
 muskets. And in every direction on the unsheltered, shell-swept plain they
 could be seen, singly or in groups, hastening with their dismal loads to
 the rear, their heads bowed and picking their steps, an admirable
 spectacle of prudent heroism.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice saw a pair on his right, a thin, puny little fellow lugging a
 burly sergeant, with both legs broken, suspended from his neck; the sight
 reminded the young man of an ant, toiling under a burden many times larger
 than itself; and even as he watched them a shell burst directly in their
 path and they were lost to view. When the smoke cleared away the sergeant
 was seen lying on his back, having received no further injury, while the
 bearer lay beside him, disemboweled. And another came up, another toiling
 ant, who, when he had turned his dead comrade on his back and examined
 him, took the sergeant up and made off with his load.
 </p>
 <p>
 It gave Maurice a chance to read Lapoulle a lesson.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I say, if you like the business, why don't you go and give that man a
 lift!"
 </p>
 <p>
 For some little time the batteries at Saint-Menges had been thundering as
 if determined to surpass all previous efforts, and Captain Beaudoin, who
 was still tramping nervously up and down before his company line, at last
 stepped up to the colonel. It was a pity, he said, to waste the men's
 morale in that way and keep their minds on the stretch for hours and
 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I can't help it; I have no orders," the colonel stoically replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had another glimpse of General Douay as he flew by at a gallop,
 followed by his staff. He had just had an interview with General de
 Wimpffen, who had ridden up to entreat him to hold his ground, which he
 thought he could promise to do, but only so long as the Calvary of Illy,
 on his right, held out; Illy once taken, he would be responsible for
 nothing; their defeat would be inevitable. General de Wimpffen averred
 that the 1st corps would look out for the position at Illy, and indeed a
 regiment of zouaves was presently seen to occupy the Calvary, so that
 General Douay, his anxiety being relieved on that score, sent Dumont's
 division to the assistance of the 12th corps, which was then being hard
 pushed. Scarcely fifteen minutes later, however, as he was returning from
 the left, whither he had ridden to see how affairs were looking, he was
 surprised, raising his eyes to the Calvary, to see it was unoccupied;
 there was not a zouave to be seen there, they had abandoned the plateau
 that was no longer tenable by reason of the terrific fire from the
 batteries at Fleigneux. With a despairing presentiment of impending
 disaster he was spurring as fast as he could to the right, when he
 encountered Dumont's division, flying in disorder, broken and tangled in
 inextricable confusion with the debris of the 1st corps. The latter,
 which, after its retrograde movement, had never been able to regain
 possession of the posts it had occupied in the morning, leaving Daigny in
 the hands of the XIIth Saxon corps and Givonne to the Prussian Guards, had
 been compelled to retreat in a northerly direction across the wood of
 Garenne, harassed by the batteries that the enemy had posted on every
 summit from one end of the valley to the other. The terrible circle of
 fire and flame was contracting; a portion of the Guards had continued
 their march on Illy, moving from east to west and turning the eminences,
 while from west to east, in the rear of the XIth corps, now masters of
 Saint-Menges, the Vth, moving steadily onward, had passed Fleigneux and
 with insolent temerity was constantly pushing its batteries more and more
 to the front, and so contemptuous were they of the ignorance and impotence
 of the French that they did not even wait for the infantry to come up to
 support their guns. It was midday; the entire horizon was aflame,
 concentrating its destructive fire on the 7th and 1st corps.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then General Douay, while the German artillery was thus preparing the way
 for the decisive movement that should make them masters of the Calvary,
 resolved to make one last desperate attempt to regain possession of the
 hill. He dispatched his orders, and throwing himself in person among the
 fugitives of Dumont's division, succeeded in forming a column which he
 sent forward to the plateau. It held its ground for a few minutes, but the
 bullets whistled so thick, the naked, treeless fields were swept by such a
 tornado of shot and shell, that it was not long before the panic broke out
 afresh, sweeping the men adown the slopes, rolling them up as straws are
 whirled before the wind. And the general, unwilling to abandon his
 project, ordered up other regiments.
 </p>
 <p>
 A staff officer galloped by, shouting to Colonel de Vineuil as he passed
 an order that was lost in the universal uproar. Hearing, the colonel was
 erect in his stirrups in an instant, his face aglow with the gladness of
 battle, and pointing to the Calvary with a grand movement of his sword:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Our turn has come at last, boys!" he shouted. "Forward!"
 </p>
 <p>
 A thrill of enthusiasm ran through the ranks at the brief address, and the
 regiment put itself in motion. Beaudoin's company was among the first to
 get on its feet, which it did to the accompaniment of much good-natured
 chaff, the men declaring they were so rusty they could not move; the
 gravel must have penetrated their joints. The fire was so hot, however,
 that by the time they had advanced a few feet they were glad to avail
 themselves of the protection of a shelter trench that lay in their path,
 along which they crept in an undignified posture, bent almost double.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Now, young fellow, look out for yourself!" Jean said to Maurice; "we're
 in for it. Don't let 'em see so much as the end of your nose, for if you
 do they will surely snip it off, and keep a sharp lookout for your legs
 and arms unless you have more than you care to keep. Those who come out of
 this with a whole skin will be lucky."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice did not hear him very distinctly; the words were lost in the
 all-pervading clamor that buzzed and hummed in the young man's ears. He
 could not have told now whether he was afraid or not; he went forward
 because the others did, borne along with them in their headlong rush,
 without distinct volition of his own; his sole desire was to have the
 affair ended as soon as possible. So true was it that he was a mere drop
 in the on-pouring torrent that when the leading files came to the end of
 the trench and began to waver at the prospect of climbing the exposed
 slope that lay before them, he immediately felt himself seized by a
 sensation of panic, and was ready to turn and fly. It was simply an
 uncontrollable instinct, a revolt of the muscles, obedient to every
 passing breath.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some of the men had already faced about when the colonel came hurrying up.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Steady there, my children. You won't cause me this great sorrow; you
 won't behave like cowards. Remember, the 106th has never turned its back
 upon the enemy; will you be the first to disgrace our flag?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he spurred his charger across the path of the fugitives, addressing
 them individually, speaking to them, of their country, in a voice that
 trembled with emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
 Lieutenant Rochas was so moved by his words that he gave way to an
 ungovernable fit of anger, raising his sword and belaboring the men with
 the flat as if it had been a club.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You dirty loafers, I'll see whether you will go up there or not! I'll
 kick you up! About face! and I'll break the jaw of the first man that
 refuses to obey!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But such an extreme measure as kicking a regiment into action was
 repugnant to the colonel.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no, lieutenant; they will follow me. Won't you, my children? You
 won't let your old colonel fight it out alone with the Prussians! Up there
 lies the way; forward!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He turned his horse and left the trench, and they did all follow, to a
 man, for he would have been considered the lowest of the low who could
 have abandoned their leader after that brave, kind speech. He was the only
 one, however, who, while crossing the open fields, erect on his tall
 horse, was cool and unconcerned; the men scattered, advancing in open
 order and availing themselves of every shelter afforded by the ground. The
 land sloped upward; there were fully five hundred yards of stubble and
 beet fields between them and the Calvary, and in place of the correctly
 aligned columns that the spectator sees advancing when a charge is ordered
 in field maneuvers, all that was to be seen was a loose array of men with
 rounded backs, singly or in small groups, hugging the ground, now crawling
 warily a little way on hands and knees, now dashing forward for the next
 cover, like huge insects fighting their way upward to the crest by dint of
 agility and address. The enemy's batteries seemed to have become aware of
 the movement; their fire was so rapid that the reports of the guns were
 blended in one continuous roar. Five men were killed, a lieutenant was cut
 in two.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean had considered themselves fortunate that their way led
 along a hedge behind which they could push forward unseen, but the man
 immediately in front of them was shot through the temples and fell back
 dead in their arms; they had to cast him down at one side. By this time,
 however, the casualties had ceased to excite attention; they were too
 numerous. A man went by, uttering frightful shrieks and pressing his hands
 upon his protruding entrails; they beheld a horse dragging himself along
 with both thighs broken, and these anguishing sights, these horrors of the
 battlefield, affected them no longer. They were suffering from the
 intolerable heat, the noonday sun that beat upon their backs and burned
 like hot coals.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How thirsty I am!" Maurice murmured. "My throat is like an ash barrel.
 Don't you notice that smell of something scorching, a smell like burning
 woolen?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean nodded. "It was just the same at Solferino; perhaps it is the smell
 that always goes with war. But hold, I have a little brandy left; we'll
 have a sup."
 </p>
 <p>
 And they paused behind the hedge a moment and raised the flask to their
 lips, but the brandy, instead of relieving their thirst, burned their
 stomach. It irritated them, that nasty taste of burnt rags in their
 mouths. Moreover they perceived that their strength was commencing to fail
 for want of sustenance and would have liked to take a bite from the half
 loaf that Maurice had in his knapsack, but it would not do to stop and
 breakfast there under fire, and then they had to keep up with their
 comrades. There was a steady stream of men coming up behind them along the
 hedge who pressed them forward, and so, doggedly bending their backs to
 the task before them, they resumed their course. Presently they made their
 final rush and reached the crest. They were on the plateau, at the very
 foot of the Calvary, the old weather-beaten cross that stood between two
 stunted lindens.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good for our side!" exclaimed Jean; "here we are! But the next thing is
 to remain here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He was right; it was not the pleasantest place in the world to be in, as
 Lapoulle remarked in a doleful tone that excited the laughter of the
 company. They all lay down again, in a field of stubble, and for all that
 three men were killed in quick succession. It was pandemonium let loose up
 there on the heights; the projectiles from Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, and
 Givonne fell in such numbers that the ground fairly seemed to smoke, as it
 does at times under a heavy shower of rain. It was clear that the position
 could not be maintained unless artillery was dispatched at once to the
 support of the troops who had been sent on such a hopeless undertaking.
 General Douay, it was said, had given instructions to bring up two
 batteries of the reserve artillery, and the men were every moment turning
 their heads, watching anxiously for the guns that did not come.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is absurd, ridiculous!" declared Beaudoin, who was again fidgeting up
 and down before the company. "Who ever heard of placing a regiment in the
 air like this and giving it no support!" Then, observing a slight
 depression on their left, he turned to Rochas: "Don't you think,
 Lieutenant, that the company would be safer there?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas stood stock still and shrugged his shoulders. "It is six of one and
 half a dozen of the other, Captain. My opinion is that we will do better
 to stay where we are."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then the captain, whose principles were opposed to swearing, forgot
 himself.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But, good God! there won't a man of us escape! We can't allow the men to
 be murdered like this!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he determined to investigate for himself the advantages of the
 position he had mentioned, but had scarcely taken ten steps when he was
 lost to sight in the smoke of an exploding shell; a splinter of the
 projectile had fractured his right leg. He fell upon his back, emitting a
 shrill cry of alarm, like a woman's.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He might have known as much," Rochas muttered. "There's no use his making
 such a fuss over it; when the dose is fixed for one, he has to take it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Some members of the company had risen to their feet on seeing their
 captain fall, and as he continued to call lustily for assistance, Jean
 finally ran to him, immediately followed by Maurice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Friends, friends, for Heaven's sake do not leave me here; carry me to the
 ambulance!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>, Captain, I don't know that we shall be able to get so far,
 but we can try."
 </p>
 <p>
 As they were discussing how they could best take hold to raise him they
 perceived, behind the hedge that had sheltered them on their way up, two
 stretcher-bearers who seemed to be waiting for something to do, and
 finally, after protracted signaling, induced them to draw near. All would
 be well if they could only get the wounded man to the ambulance without
 accident, but the way was long and the iron hail more pitiless than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
 The bearers had tightly bandaged the injured limb in order to keep the
 bones in position and were about to bear the captain off the field on what
 children call a "chair," formed by joining their hands and slipping an arm
 of the patient over each of their necks, when Colonel de Vineuil, who had
 heard of the accident, came up, spurring his horse. He manifested much
 emotion, for he had known the young man ever since his graduation from
 Saint-Cyr.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Cheer up, my poor boy; have courage. You are in no danger; the doctors
 will save your leg."
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain's face wore an expression of resignation, as if he had
 summoned up all his courage to bear his misfortune manfully.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, my dear Colonel; I feel it is all up with me, and I would rather have
 it so. The only thing that distresses me is the waiting for the inevitable
 end."
 </p>
 <p>
 The bearers carried him away, and were fortunate enough to reach the hedge
 in safety, behind which they trotted swiftly away with their burden. The
 colonel's eyes followed them anxiously, and when he saw them reach the
 clump of trees where the ambulance was stationed a look of deep relief
 rose to his face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But you, Colonel," Maurice suddenly exclaimed, "you are wounded too!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had perceived blood dripping from the colonel's left boot. A projectile
 of some description had carried away the heel of the foot-covering and
 forced the steel shank into the flesh.
 </p>
 <p>
 M. de Vineuil bent over his saddle and glanced unconcernedly at the
 member, in which the sensation at that time must have been far from
 pleasurable.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes," he replied, "it is a little remembrance that I received a
 while ago. A mere scratch, that don't prevent me from sitting my horse&mdash;"
 And he added, as he turned to resume his position to the rear of his
 regiment: "As long as a man can stick on his horse he's all right."
 </p>
 <p>
 At last the two batteries of reserve artillery came up. Their arrival was
 an immense relief to the anxiously expectant men, as if the guns were to
 be a rampart of protection to them and at the same time demolish the
 hostile batteries that were thundering against them from every side. And
 then, too, it was in itself an exhilarating spectacle to see the
 magnificent order they preserved as they came dashing up, each gun
 followed by its caisson, the drivers seated on the near horse and holding
 the off horse by the bridle, the cannoneers bolt upright on the chests,
 the chiefs of detachment riding in their proper position on the flank.
 Distances were preserved as accurately as if they were on parade, and all
 the time they were tearing across the fields at headlong speed, with the
 roar and crash of a hurricane.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who had lain down again, arose and said to Jean in great
 excitement:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look! over there on the left, that is Honore's battery. I can recognize
 the men."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean gave him a back-handed blow that brought him down to his recumbent
 position.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lie down, will you! and make believe dead!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But they were both deeply interested in watching the maneuvers of the
 battery, and never once removed their eyes from it; it cheered their heart
 to witness the cool and intrepid activity of those men, who, they hoped,
 might yet bring victory to them.
 </p>
 <p>
 The battery had wheeled into position on a bare summit to the left, where
 it brought up all standing; then, quick as a flash, the cannoneers leaped
 from the chests and unhooked the limbers, and the drivers, leaving the gun
 in position, drove fifteen yards to the rear, where they wheeled again so
 as to bring team and limber face to the enemy and there remained,
 motionless as statues. In less time than it takes to tell it the guns were
 in place, with the proper intervals between them, distributed into three
 sections of two guns each, each section commanded by a lieutenant, and
 over the whole a captain, a long maypole of a man, who made a terribly
 conspicuous landmark on the plateau. And this captain, having first made a
 brief calculation, was heard to shout:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Sight for sixteen hundred yards!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Their fire was to be directed upon a Prussian battery, screened by some
 bushes, to the left of Fleigneux, the shells from which were rendering the
 position of the Calvary untenable.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Honore's piece, you see," Maurice began again, whose excitement was such
 that he could not keep still, "Honore's piece is in the center section.
 There he is now, bending over to speak to the gunner; you remember Louis,
 the gunner, don't you? the little fellow with whom we had a drink at
 Vouziers? And that fellow in the rear, who sits so straight on his
 handsome chestnut, is Adolphe, the driver&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 First came the gun with its chief and six cannoneers, then the limber with
 its four horses ridden by two men, beyond that the caisson with its six
 horses and three drivers, still further to the rear were the <i>prolonge</i>,
 forge, and battery wagon; and this array of men, horses and <i>materiel</i>
 extended to the rear in a straight unbroken line of more than a hundred
 yards in length; to say nothing of the spare caisson and the men and
 beasts who were to fill the places of those removed by casualties, who
 were stationed at one side, as much as possible out of the enemy's line of
 fire.
 </p>
 <p>
 And now Honore was attending to the loading of his gun. The two men whose
 duty it was to fetch the cartridge and the projectile returned from the
 caisson, where the corporal and the artificer were stationed; two other
 cannoneers, standing at the muzzle of the piece, slipped into the bore the
 cartridge, a charge of powder in an envelope of serge, and gently drove it
 home with the rammer, then in like manner introduced the shell, the studs
 of which creaked faintly in the spirals of the rifling. When the primer
 was inserted in the vent and all was in readiness, Honore thought he would
 like to point the gun himself for the first shot, and throwing himself in
 a semi-recumbent posture on the trail, working with one hand the screw
 that regulated the elevation, with the other he signaled continually to
 the gunner, who, standing behind him, moved the piece by imperceptible
 degrees to right or left with the assistance of the lever.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That ought to be about right," he said as he arose.
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain came up, and stooping until his long body was bent almost
 double, verified the elevation. At each gun stood the assistant gunner,
 waiting to pull the lanyard that should ignite the fulminate by means of a
 serrated wire. And the orders were given in succession, deliberately, by
 number:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Number one, Fire! Number two, Fire!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Six reports were heard, the guns recoiled, and while they were being
 brought back to position the chiefs of detachment observed the effect of
 the shots and found that the range was short. They made the necessary
 correction and the evolution was repeated, in exactly the same manner as
 before; and it was that cool precision, that mechanical routine of duty,
 without agitation and without haste, that did so much to maintain the <i>morale</i>
 of the men. They were a little family, united by the tie of a common
 occupation, grouped around the gun, which they loved and reverenced as if
 it had been a living thing; it was the object of all their care and
 attention, to it all else was subservient, men, horses, caisson,
 everything. Thence also arose the spirit of unity and cohesion that
 animated the battery at large, making all its members work together for
 the common glory and the common good, like a well-regulated household.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 106th had cheered lustily at the completion of the first round; they
 were going to make those bloody Prussian guns shut their mouths at last!
 but their elation was succeeded by dismay when it was seen that the
 projectiles fell short, many of them bursting in the air and never
 reaching the bushes that served to mask the enemy's artillery.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Honore," Maurice continued, "says that all the other pieces are popguns
 and that his old girl is the only one that is good for anything. Ah, his
 old girl! He talks as if she were his wife and there were not another like
 her in the world! Just notice how jealously he watches her and makes the
 men clean her off! I suppose he is afraid she will overheat herself and
 take cold!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He continued rattling on in this pleasant vein to Jean, both of them
 cheered and encouraged by the cool bravery with which the artillerymen
 served their guns; but the Prussian batteries, after firing three rounds,
 had now got the range, which, too long at the beginning, they had at last
 ciphered down to such a fine point that their shells were landed
 invariably among the French pieces, while the latter, notwithstanding the
 efforts that were made to increase their range, still continued to place
 their projectiles short of the enemy's position. One of Honore's
 cannoneers was killed while loading the piece; the others pushed the body
 out of their way, and the service went on with the same methodical
 precision, with neither more nor less haste. In the midst of the
 projectiles that fell and burst continually the same unvarying rhythmical
 movements went on uninterruptedly about the gun; the cartridge and shell
 were introduced, the gun was pointed, the lanyard pulled, the carriage
 brought back to place; and all with such undeviating regularity that the
 men might have been taken for automatons, devoid of sight and hearing.
 </p>
 <p>
 What impressed Maurice, however, more than anything else, was the attitude
 of the drivers, sitting straight and stiff in their saddles fifteen yards
 to the rear, face to the enemy. There was Adolphe, the broad-chested, with
 his big blond mustache across his rubicund face; and who shall tell the
 amount of courage a man must have to enable him to sit without winking and
 watch the shells coming toward him, and he not allowed even to twirl his
 thumbs by way of diversion! The men who served the guns had something to
 occupy their minds, while the drivers, condemned to immobility, had death
 constantly before their eyes, and plenty of leisure to speculate on
 probabilities. They were made to face the battlefield because, had they
 turned their backs to it, the coward that so often lurks at the bottom of
 man's nature might have got the better of them and swept away man and
 beast. It is the unseen danger that makes dastards of us; that which we
 can see we brave. The army has no more gallant set of men in its ranks
 than the drivers in their obscure position.
 </p>
 <p>
 Another man had been killed, two horses of a caisson had been
 disemboweled, and the enemy kept up such a murderous fire that there was a
 prospect of the entire battery being knocked to pieces should they persist
 in holding that position longer. It was time to take some step to baffle
 that tremendous fire, notwithstanding the danger there was in moving, and
 the captain unhesitatingly gave orders to bring up the limbers.
 </p>
 <p>
 The risky maneuver was executed with lightning speed; the drivers came up
 at a gallop, wheeled their limber into position in rear of the gun, when
 the cannoneers raised the trail of the piece and hooked on. The movement,
 however, collecting as it did, momentarily, men and horses on the battery
 front in something of a huddle, created a certain degree of confusion, of
 which the enemy took advantage by increasing the rapidity of their fire;
 three more men dropped. The teams darted away at breakneck speed,
 describing an arc of a circle among the fields, and the battery took up
 its new position some fifty or sixty yards more to the right, on a gentle
 eminence that was situated on the other flank of the 106th. The pieces
 were unlimbered, the drivers resumed their station at the rear, face to
 the enemy, and the firing was reopened; and so little time was lost
 between leaving their old post and taking up the new that the earth had
 barely ceased to tremble under the concussion.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice uttered a cry of dismay, when, after three attempts, the Prussians
 had again got their range; the first shell landed squarely on Honore's
 gun. The artilleryman rushed forward, and with a trembling hand felt to
 ascertain what damage had been done his pet; a great wedge had been
 chipped from the bronze muzzle. But it was not disabled, and the work went
 on as before, after they had removed from beneath the wheels the body of
 another cannoneer, with whose blood the entire carriage was besplashed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It was not little Louis; I am glad of that," said Maurice, continuing to
 think aloud. "There he is now, pointing his gun; he must be wounded,
 though, for he is only using his left arm. Ah, he is a brave lad, is
 little Louis; and how well he and Adolphe get on together, in spite of
 their little tiffs, only provided the gunner, the man who serves on foot,
 shows a proper amount of respect for the driver, the man who rides a
 horse, notwithstanding that the latter is by far the more ignorant of the
 two. Now that they are under fire, though, Louis is as good a man as
 Adolphe&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, who had been watching events in silence, gave utterance to a
 distressful cry:
 </p>
 <p>
 "They will have to give it up! No troops in the world could stand such a
 fire."
 </p>
 <p>
 Within the space of five minutes the second position had become as
 untenable as was the first; the projectiles kept falling with the same
 persistency, the same deadly precision. A shell dismounted a gun,
 fracturing the chase, killing a lieutenant and two men. Not one of the
 enemy's shots failed to reach, and at each discharge they secured a still
 greater accuracy of range, so that if the battery should remain there
 another five minutes they would not have a gun or a man left. The crushing
 fire threatened to wipe them all out of existence.
 </p>
 <p>
 Again the captain's ringing voice was heard ordering up the limbers. The
 drivers dashed up at a gallop and wheeled their teams into place to allow
 the cannoneers to hook on the guns, but before Adolphe had time to get up
 Louis was struck by a fragment of shell that tore open his throat and
 broke his jaw; he fell across the trail of the carriage just as he was on
 the point of raising it. Adolphe was there instantly, and beholding his
 prostrate comrade weltering in his blood, jumped from his horse and was
 about to raise him to his saddle and bear him away. And at that moment,
 just as the battery was exposed flank to the enemy in the act of wheeling,
 offering a fair target, a crashing discharge came, and Adolphe reeled and
 fell to the ground, his chest crushed in, with arms wide extended. In his
 supreme convulsion he seized his comrade about the body, and thus they
 lay, locked in each other's arms in a last embrace, "married" even in
 death.
 </p>
 <p>
 Notwithstanding the slaughtered horses and the confusion that that
 death-dealing discharge had caused among the men, the battery had rattled
 up the slope of a hillock and taken post a few yards from the spot where
 Jean and Maurice were lying. For the third time the guns were unlimbered,
 the drivers retired to the rear and faced the enemy, and the cannoneers,
 with a gallantry that nothing could daunt, at once reopened fire.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is as if the end of all things were at hand!" said Maurice, the sound
 of whose voice was lost in the uproar.
 </p>
 <p>
 It seemed indeed as if heaven and earth were confounded in that hideous
 din. Great rocks were cleft asunder, the sun was hid from sight at times
 in clouds of sulphurous vapor. When the cataclysm was at its height the
 horses stood with drooping heads, trembling, dazed with terror. The
 captain's tall form was everywhere upon the eminence; suddenly he was seen
 no more; a shell had cut him clean in two, and he sank, as a ship's mast
 that is snapped off at the base.
 </p>
 <p>
 But it was about Honore's gun, even more than the others, that the
 conflict raged, with cool efficiency and obstinate determination. The
 non-commissioned officer found it necessary to forget his chevrons for the
 time being and lend a hand in working the piece, for he had now but three
 cannoneers left; he pointed the gun and pulled the lanyard, while the
 others brought ammunition from the caisson, loaded, and handled the rammer
 and the sponge. He had sent for men and horses from the battery reserves
 that were kept to supply the places of those removed by casualties, but
 they were slow in coming, and in the meantime the survivors must do the
 work of the dead. It was a great discouragement to all that their
 projectiles ranged short and burst almost without exception in the air,
 inflicting no injury on the powerful batteries of the foe, the fire of
 which was so efficient. And suddenly Honore let slip an oath that was
 heard above the thunder of the battle; ill-luck, ill-luck, nothing but
 ill-luck! the right wheel of his piece was smashed! <i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i>
 what a state she was in, the poor darling! stretched on her side with a
 broken paw, her nose buried in the ground, crippled and good for nothing!
 The sight brought big tears to his eyes, he laid his trembling hand upon
 the breech, as if the ardor of his love might avail to warm his dear
 mistress back to life. And the best gun of them all, the only one that had
 been able to drop a few shells among the enemy! Then suddenly he conceived
 a daring project, nothing less than to repair the injury there and then,
 under that terrible fire. Assisted by one of his men he ran back to the
 caisson and secured the spare wheel that was attached to the rear axle,
 and then commenced the most dangerous operation that can be executed on a
 battlefield. Fortunately the extra men and horses that he had sent for
 came up just then, and he had two cannoneers to lend him a hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 For the third time, however, the strength of the battery was so reduced as
 practically to disable it. To push their heroic daring further would be
 madness; the order was given to abandon the position definitely.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Make haste, comrades!" Honore exclaimed. "Even if she is fit for no
 further service we'll carry her off; those fellows shan't have her!"
 </p>
 <p>
 To save the gun, even as men risk their life to save the flag; that was
 his idea. And he had not ceased to speak when he was stricken down as by a
 thunderbolt, his right arm torn from its socket, his left flank laid open.
 He had fallen upon his gun he loved so well, and lay there as if stretched
 on a bed of honor, with head erect, his unmutilated face turned toward the
 enemy, and bearing an expression of proud defiance that made him beautiful
 in death. From his torn jacket a letter had fallen to the ground and lay
 in the pool of blood that dribbled slowly from above.
 </p>
 <p>
 The only lieutenant left alive shouted the order: "Bring up the limbers!"
 </p>
 <p>
 A caisson had exploded with a roar that rent the skies. They were obliged
 to take the horses from another caisson in order to save a gun of which
 the team had been killed. And when, for the last time, the drivers had
 brought up their smoking horses and the guns had been limbered up, the
 whole battery flew away at a gallop and never stopped until they reached
 the edge of the wood of la Garenne, nearly twelve hundred yards away.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice had seen the whole. He shivered with horror, and murmured
 mechanically, in a faint voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! poor fellow, poor fellow!"
 </p>
 <p>
 In addition to this feeling of mental distress he had a horrible sensation
 of physical suffering, as if something was gnawing at his vitals. It was
 the animal portion of his nature asserting itself; he was at the end of
 his endurance, was ready to sink with hunger. His perceptions were dimmed,
 he was not even conscious of the dangerous position the regiment was in
 now it no longer was protected by the battery. It was more than likely
 that the enemy would not long delay to attack the plateau in force.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look here," he said to Jean, "I <i>must</i> eat&mdash;if I am to be
 killed for it the next minute, I must eat."
 </p>
 <p>
 He opened his knapsack and, taking out the bread with shaking hands, set
 his teeth in it voraciously. The bullets were whistling above their heads,
 two shells exploded only a few yards away, but all was as naught to him in
 comparison with his craving hunger.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Will you have some, Jean?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The corporal was watching him with hungry eyes and a stupid expression on
 his face; his stomach was also twinging him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, I don't care if I do; this suffering is more than I can stand."
 </p>
 <p>
 They divided the loaf between them and each devoured his portion
 gluttonously, unmindful of what was going on about them so long as a crumb
 remained. And it was at that time that they saw their colonel for the last
 time, sitting his big horse, with his blood-stained boot. The regiment was
 surrounded on every side; already some of the companies had left the
 field. Then, unable longer to restrain their flight, with tears standing
 in his eyes and raising his sword above his head:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My children," cried M. de Vineuil, "I commend you to the protection of
 God, who thus far has spared us all!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He rode off down the hill, surrounded by a swarm of fugitives, and
 vanished from their sight.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, they knew not how, Maurice and Jean found themselves once more
 behind the hedge, with the remnant of their company. Some forty men at the
 outside were all that remained, with Lieutenant Rochas as their commander,
 and the regimental standard was with them; the subaltern who carried it
 had furled the silk about the staff in order to try to save it. They made
 their way along the hedge, as far as it extended, to a cluster of small
 trees upon a hillside, where Rochas made them halt and reopen fire. The
 men, dispersed in skirmishing order and sufficiently protected, could hold
 their ground, the more that an important calvary movement was in
 preparation on their right and regiments of infantry were being brought up
 to support it.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was at that moment that Maurice comprehended the full scope of that
 mighty, irresistible turning movement that was now drawing near
 completion. That morning he had watched the Prussians debouching by the
 Saint-Albert pass and had seen their advanced guard pushed forward, first
 to Saint-Menges, then to Fleigneux, and now, behind the wood of la
 Garenne, he could hear the thunder of the artillery of the Guard, could
 behold other German uniforms arriving on the scene over the hills of
 Givonne. Yet a few moments, it might be, and the circle would be complete;
 the Guard would join hands with the Vth corps, surrounding the French army
 with a living wall, girdling them about with a belt of flaming artillery.
 It was with the resolve to make one supreme, desperate effort, to try to
 hew a passage through that advancing wall, that General Margueritte's
 division of the reserve cavalry was massing behind a protecting crest
 preparatory to charging. They were about to charge into the jaws of death,
 with no possibility of achieving any useful result, solely for the glory
 of France and the French army. And Maurice, whose thoughts turned to
 Prosper, was a witness of the terrible spectacle.
 </p>
 <p>
 What between the messages that were given him to carry and their answers,
 Prosper had been kept busy since daybreak spurring up and down the plateau
 of Illy. The cavalrymen had been awakened at peep of dawn, man by man,
 without sound of trumpet, and to make their morning coffee had devised the
 ingenious expedient of screening their fires with a greatcoat so as not to
 attract the attention of the enemy. Then there came a period when they
 were left entirely to themselves, with nothing to occupy them; they seemed
 to be forgotten by their commanders. They could hear the sound of the
 cannonading, could descry the puffs of smoke, could see the distant
 movements of the infantry, but were utterly ignorant of the battle, its
 importance, and its results. Prosper, as far as he was concerned, was
 suffering from want of sleep. The cumulative fatigue induced by many
 nights of broken rest, the invincible somnolency caused by the easy gait
 of his mount, made life a burden. He dreamed dreams and saw visions; now
 he was sleeping comfortably in a bed between clean sheets, now snoring on
 the bare ground among sharpened flints. For minutes at a time he would
 actually be sound asleep in his saddle, a lifeless clod, his steed's
 intelligence answering for both. Under such circumstances comrades had
 often tumbled from their seats upon the road. They were so fagged that
 when they slept the trumpets no longer awakened them; the only way to
 rouse them from their lethargy and get them on their feet was to kick them
 soundly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But what are they going to do, what are they going to do with us?"
 Prosper kept saying to himself. It was the only thing he could think of to
 keep himself awake.
 </p>
 <p>
 For six hours the cannon had been thundering. As they climbed a hill two
 comrades, riding at his side, had been struck down by a shell, and as they
 rode onward seven or eight others had bit the dust, pierced by rifle-balls
 that came no one could say whence. It was becoming tiresome, that slow
 parade, as useless as it was dangerous, up and down the battlefield. At
 last&mdash;it was about one o'clock&mdash;he learned that it had been
 decided they were to be killed off in a somewhat more decent manner.
 Margueritte's entire division, comprising three regiments of chasseurs
 d'Afrique, one of chasseurs de France, and one of hussars, had been drawn
 in and posted in a shallow valley a little to the south of the Calvary of
 Illy. The trumpets had sounded: "Dismount!" and then the officers' command
 ran down the line to tighten girths and look to packs.
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper alighted, stretched his cramped limbs, and gave Zephyr a friendly
 pat upon the neck. Poor Zephyr! he felt the degradation of the
 ignominious, heartbreaking service they were subjected to almost as keenly
 as his master; and not only that, but he had to carry a small arsenal of
 stores and implements of various kinds: the holsters stuffed with his
 master's linen and underclothing and the greatcoat rolled above, the
 stable suit, blouse, and overalls, and the sack containing brushes,
 currycomb, and other articles of equine toilet behind the saddle, the
 haversack with rations slung at his side, to say nothing of such trifles
 as side-lines and picket-pins, the watering bucket and the wooden basin.
 The cavalryman's tender heart was stirred by a feeling of compassion, as
 he tightened up the girth and looked to see that everything was secure in
 its place.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was a trying moment. Prosper was no more a coward than the next man,
 but his mouth was intolerably dry and hot; he lit a cigarette in the hope
 that it would relieve the unpleasant sensation. When about to charge no
 man can assert with any degree of certainty that he will ride back again.
 The suspense lasted some five or six minutes; it was said that General
 Margueritte had ridden forward to reconnoiter the ground over which they
 were to charge; they were awaiting his return. The five regiments had been
 formed in three columns, each column having a depth of seven squadrons;
 enough to afford an ample meal to the hostile guns.
 </p>
 <p>
 Presently the trumpets rang out: "To horse!" and this was succeeded almost
 immediately by the shrill summons: "Draw sabers!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel of each regiment had previously ridden out and taken his
 proper position, twenty-five yards to the front, the captains were all at
 their posts at the head of their squadrons. Then there was another period
 of anxious waiting, amid a silence heavy as that of death. Not a sound,
 not a breath, there, beneath the blazing sun; nothing, save the beating of
 those brave hearts. One order more, the supreme, the decisive one, and
 that mass, now so inert and motionless, would become a resistless tornado,
 sweeping all before it.
 </p>
 <p>
 At that juncture, however, an officer appeared coming over the crest of
 the hill in front, wounded, and preserving his seat in the saddle only by
 the assistance of a man on either side. No one recognized him at first,
 but presently a deep, ominous murmur began to run from squadron to
 squadron, which quickly swelled into a furious uproar. It was General
 Margueritte, who had received a wound from which he died a few days later;
 a musket-ball had passed through both cheeks, carrying away a portion of
 the tongue and palate. He was incapable of speech, but waved his arm in
 the direction of the enemy. The fury of his men knew no bounds; their
 cries rose louder still upon the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is our general! Avenge him, avenge him!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then the colonel of the first regiment, raising aloft his saber, shouted
 in a voice of thunder:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Charge!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The trumpets sounded, the column broke into a trot and was away. Prosper
 was in the leading squadron, but almost at the extreme right of the right
 wing, a position of less danger than the center, upon which the enemy
 always naturally concentrate their hottest fire. When they had topped the
 summit of the Calvary and began to descend the slope beyond that led
 downward into the broad plain he had a distinct view, some two-thirds of a
 mile away, of the Prussian squares that were to be the object of their
 attack. Beside that vision all the rest was dim and confused before his
 eyes; he moved onward as one in a dream, with a strange ringing in his
 ears, a sensation of voidness in his mind that left him incapable of
 framing an idea. He was a part of the great engine that tore along,
 controlled by a superior will. The command ran along the line: "Keep touch
 of knees! Keep touch of knees!" in order to keep the men closed up and
 give their ranks the resistance and rigidity of a wall of granite, and as
 their trot became swifter and swifter and finally broke into a mad gallop,
 the chasseurs d'Afrique gave their wild Arab cry that excited their wiry
 steeds to the verge of frenzy. Onward they tore, faster and faster still,
 until their gallop was a race of unchained demons, their shouts the
 shrieks of souls in mortal agony; onward they plunged amid a storm of
 bullets that rattled on casque and breastplate, on buckle and scabbard,
 with a sound like hail; into the bosom of that hailstorm flashed that
 thunderbolt beneath which the earth shook and trembled, leaving behind it,
 as it passed, an odor of burned woolen and the exhalations of wild beasts.
 </p>
 <p>
 At five hundred yards the line wavered an instant, then swirled and broke
 in a frightful eddy that brought Prosper to the ground. He clutched Zephyr
 by the mane and succeeded in recovering his seat. The center had given
 way, riddled, almost annihilated as it was by the musketry fire, while the
 two wings had wheeled and ridden back a little way to renew their
 formation. It was the foreseen, foredoomed destruction of the leading
 squadron. Disabled horses covered the ground, some quiet in death, but
 many struggling violently in their strong agony; and everywhere dismounted
 riders could be seen, running as fast as their short legs would let them,
 to capture themselves another mount. Many horses that had lost their
 master came galloping back to the squadron and took their place in line of
 their own accord, to rush with their comrades back into the fire again, as
 if there was some strange attraction for them in the smell of gunpowder.
 The charge was resumed; the second squadron went forward, like the first,
 at a constantly accelerated rate of speed, the men bending upon their
 horses' neck, holding the saber along the thigh, ready for use upon the
 enemy. Two hundred yards more were gained this time, amid the thunderous,
 deafening uproar, but again the center broke under the storm of bullets;
 men and horses went down in heaps, and the piled corpses made an
 insurmountable barrier for those who followed. Thus was the second
 squadron in its turn mown down, annihilated, leaving its task to be
 accomplished by those who came after.
 </p>
 <p>
 When for the third time the men were called upon to charge and responded
 with invincible heroism, Prosper found that his companions were
 principally hussars and chasseurs de France. Regiments and squadrons, as
 organizations, had ceased to exist; their constituent elements were drops
 in the mighty wave that alternately broke and reared its crest again, to
 swallow up all that lay in its destructive path. He had long since lost
 distinct consciousness of what was going on around him, and suffered his
 movements to be guided by his mount, faithful Zephyr, who had received a
 wound in the ear that seemed to madden him. He was now in the center,
 where all about him horses were rearing, pawing the air, and falling
 backward; men were dismounted as if torn from their saddle by the blast of
 a tornado, while others, shot through some vital part, retained their seat
 and rode onward in the ranks with vacant, sightless eyes. And looking back
 over the additional two hundred yards that this effort had won for them,
 they could see the field of yellow stubble strewn thick with dead and
 dying. Some there were who had fallen headlong from their saddle and
 buried their face in the soft earth. Others had alighted on their back and
 were staring up into the sun with terror-stricken eyes that seemed
 bursting from their sockets. There was a handsome black horse, an
 officer's charger, that had been disemboweled, and was making frantic
 efforts to rise, his fore feet entangled in his entrails. Beneath the
 fire, that became constantly more murderous as they drew nearer, the
 survivors in the wings wheeled their horses and fell back to concentrate
 their strength for a fresh onset.
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally it was the fourth squadron, which, on the fourth attempt, reached
 the Prussian lines. Prosper made play with his saber, hacking away at
 helmets and dark uniforms as well as he could distinguish them, for all
 was dim before him, as in a dense mist. Blood flowed in torrents; Zephyr's
 mouth was smeared with it, and to account for it he said to himself that
 the good horse must have been using his teeth on the Prussians. The clamor
 around him became so great that he could not hear his own voice, although
 his throat seemed splitting from the yells that issued from it. But behind
 the first Prussian line there was another, and then another, and then
 another still. Their gallant efforts went for nothing; those dense masses
 of men were like a tangled jungle that closed around the horses and riders
 who entered it and buried them in its rank growths. They might hew down
 those who were within reach of their sabers; others stood ready to take
 their place, the last squadrons were lost and swallowed up in their vast
 numbers. The firing, at point-blank range, was so furious that the men's
 clothing was ignited. Nothing could stand before it, all went down; and
 the work that it left unfinished was completed by bayonet and musket butt.
 Of the brave men who rode into action that day two-thirds remained upon
 the battlefield, and the sole end achieved by that mad charge was to add
 another glorious page to history. And then Zephyr, struck by a musket-ball
 full in the chest, dropped in a heap, crushing beneath him Prosper's right
 thigh; and the pain was so acute that the young man fainted.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean, who had watched the gallant effort with burning
 interest, uttered an exclamation of rage.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> what bravery wasted!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And they resumed their firing from among the trees of the low hill where
 they were deployed in skirmishing order. Rochas himself had picked up an
 abandoned musket and was blazing away with the rest. But the plateau of
 Illy was lost to them by this time beyond hope of recovery; the Prussians
 were pouring in upon it from every quarter. It was somewhere in the
 neighborhood of two o'clock, and their great movement was accomplished;
 the Vth corps and the Guards had effected their junction, the investment
 of the French army was complete.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was suddenly brought to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am done for," he murmured.
 </p>
 <p>
 He had received what seemed to him like a smart blow of a hammer on the
 crown of his head, and his <i>kepi</i> lay behind him with a great furrow
 plowed through its top. At first he thought that the bullet had certainly
 penetrated the skull and laid bare the brain; his dread of finding a
 yawning orifice there was so great that for some seconds he dared not
 raise his hand to ascertain the truth. When finally he ventured, his
 fingers, on withdrawing them, were red with an abundant flow of blood, and
 the pain was so intense that he fainted.
 </p>
 <p>
 Just then Rochas gave the order to fall back. The Prussians had crept up
 on them and were only two or three hundred yards away; they were in danger
 of being captured.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Be cool, don't hurry; face about and give 'em another shot. Rally behind
 that low wall that you see down there."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was in despair; he knew not what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are not going to leave our corporal behind, are we, lieutenant?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "What are we to do? he has turned up his toes."
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no! he is breathing still. Take him along!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas shrugged his shoulders as if to say they could not bother
 themselves for every man that dropped. A wounded man is esteemed of little
 value on the battlefield. Then Maurice addressed his supplications to
 Lapoulle and Pache.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, give me a helping hand. I am not strong enough to carry him
 unassisted."
 </p>
 <p>
 They were deaf to his entreaties; all they could hear was the voice that
 urged them to seek safety for themselves. The Prussians were now not more
 than a hundred yards from them; already they were on their hands and
 knees, crawling as fast as they could go toward the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice, weeping tears of rage, thus left alone with his unconscious
 companion, raised him in his arms and endeavored to lug him away, but he
 found his puny strength unequal to the task, exhausted as he was by
 fatigue and the emotions of the day. At the first step he took he reeled
 and fell with his burden. If only he could catch sight of a
 stretcher-bearer! He strained his eyes, thought he had discovered one
 among the crowd of fugitives, and made frantic gestures of appeal; no one
 came, they were left behind, alone. Summoning up his strength with a
 determined effort of the will he seized Jean once more and succeeded in
 advancing some thirty paces, when a shell burst near them and he thought
 that all was ended, that he, too, was to die on the body of his comrade.
 </p>
 <p>
 Slowly, cautiously, Maurice picked himself up. He felt his body, arms, and
 legs; nothing, not a scratch. Why should he not look out for himself and
 fly, alone? There was time left still; a few bounds would take him to the
 wall and he would be saved. His horrible sensation of fear returned and
 made him frantic. He was collecting his energies to break away and run,
 when a feeling stronger than death intervened and vanquished the base
 impulse. What, abandon Jean! he could not do it. It would be like
 mutilating his own being; the brotherly affection that had bourgeoned and
 grown between him and that rustic had struck its roots down into his life,
 too deep to be slain like that. The feeling went back to the earliest
 days, was perhaps as old as the world itself; it was as if there were but
 they two upon earth, of whom one could not forsake the other without
 forsaking himself, and being doomed thenceforth to an eternity of
 solitude. Molded of the same clay, quickened by the same spirit, duty
 imperiously commanded to save himself in saving his brother.
 </p>
 <p>
 Had it not been for the crust of bread he ate an hour before under the
 Prussian shells Maurice could never have done what he did; <i>how</i> he
 did it he could never in subsequent days remember. He must have hoisted
 Jean upon his shoulders and crawled through the brush and brambles,
 falling a dozen times only to pick himself up and go on again, stumbling
 at every rut, at every pebble. His indomitable will sustained him, his
 dogged resolution would have enabled him to bear a mountain on his back.
 Behind the low wall he found Rochas and the few men that were left of the
 squad, firing away as stoutly as ever and defending the flag, which the
 subaltern held beneath his arm. It had not occurred to anyone to designate
 lines of retreat for the several army corps in case the day should go
 against them; owing to this want of foresight every general was at liberty
 to act as seemed to him best, and at this stage of the conflict they all
 found themselves being crowded back upon Sedan under the steady,
 unrelaxing pressure of the German armies. The second division of the 7th
 corps fell back in comparatively good order, while the remnants of the
 other divisions, mingled with the debris of the 1st corps, were already
 streaming into the city in terrible disorder, a roaring torrent of rage
 and fright that bore all, men and beasts, before it.
 </p>
 <p>
 But to Maurice, at that moment, was granted the satisfaction of seeing
 Jean unclose his eyes, and as he was running to a stream that flowed near
 by, for water with which to bathe his friend's face, he was surprised,
 looking down on his right into a sheltered valley that lay between rugged
 slopes, to behold the same peasant whom he had seen that morning, still
 leisurely driving the plow through the furrow with the assistance of his
 big white horse. Why should he lose a day? Men might fight, but none the
 less the corn would keep on growing; and folks must live.

 <h2>
 VI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Up on his lofty terrace, whither he had betaken himself to watch how
 affairs were shaping, Delaherche at last became impatient and was seized
 with an uncontrollable desire for news. He could see that the enemy's
 shells were passing over the city and that the few projectiles which had
 fallen on the houses in the vicinity were only responses, made at long
 intervals, to the irregular and harmless fire from Fort Palatinat, but he
 could discern nothing of the battle, and his agitation was rising to fever
 heat; he experienced an imperious longing for intelligence, which was
 constantly stimulated by the reflection that his life and fortune would be
 in danger should the army be defeated. He found it impossible to remain
 there longer, and went downstairs, leaving behind him the telescope on its
 tripod, turned on the German batteries.
 </p>
 <p>
 When he had descended, however, he lingered a moment, detained by the
 aspect of the central garden of the factory. It was near one o'clock, and
 the ambulance was crowded with wounded men; the wagons kept driving up to
 the entrance in an unbroken stream. The regular ambulance wagons of the
 medical department, two-wheeled and four-wheeled, were too few in number
 to meet the demand, and vehicles of every description from the artillery
 and other trains, <i>prolonges</i>, provision vans, everything on wheels
 that could be picked up on the battlefield, came rolling up with their
 ghastly loads; and later in the day even carrioles and market-gardeners'
 carts were pressed into the service and harnessed to horses that were
 found straying along the roads. Into these motley conveyances were huddled
 the men collected from the flying ambulances, where their hurts had
 received such hasty attention as could be afforded. It was a sight to move
 the most callous to behold the unloading of those poor wretches, some with
 a greenish pallor on their face, others suffused with the purple hue that
 denotes congestion; many were in a state of coma, others uttered piercing
 cries of anguish; some there were who, in their semi-conscious condition,
 yielded themselves to the arms of the attendants with a look of deepest
 terror in their eyes, while a few, the minute a hand was laid on them,
 died of the consequent shock. They continued to arrive in such numbers
 that soon every bed in the vast apartment would have its occupant, and
 Major Bouroche had given orders to make use of the straw that had been
 spread thickly upon the floor at one end. He and his assistants had thus
 far been able to attend to all the cases with reasonable promptness; he
 had requested Mme. Delaherche to furnish him with another table, with
 mattress and oilcloth cover, for the shed where he had established his
 operating room. The assistant would thrust a napkin saturated with
 chloroform to the patient's nostrils, the keen knife flashed in the air,
 there was the faint rasping of the saw, barely audible, the blood spurted
 in short, sharp jets that were checked immediately. As soon as one subject
 had been operated on another was brought in, and they followed one another
 in such quick succession that there was barely time to pass a sponge over
 the protecting oilcloth. At the extremity of the grass plot, screened from
 sight by a clump of lilac bushes, they had set up a kind of morgue whither
 they carried the bodies of the dead, which were removed from the beds
 without a moment's delay in order to make room for the living, and this
 receptacle also served to receive the amputated legs, and arms, whatever
 debris of flesh and bone remained upon the table.
 </p>
 <p>
 Mme. Delaherche and Gilberte, seated at the foot of one of the great
 trees, found it hard work to keep pace with the demand for bandages.
 Bouroche, who happened to be passing, his face very red, his apron white
 no longer, threw a bundle of linen to Delaherche and shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here! be doing something; make yourself useful!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the manufacturer objected. "Oh! excuse me; I must go and try to pick
 up some news. One can't tell whether his neck is safe or not." Then,
 touching his lips to his wife's hair: "My poor Gilberte, to think that a
 shell may burn us out of house and home at any moment! It is horrible."
 </p>
 <p>
 She was very pale; she raised her head and glanced about her, shuddering
 as she did so. Then, involuntarily, her unextinguishable smile returned to
 her lips.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, horrible, indeed! and all those poor men that they are cutting and
 carving. I don't see how it is that I stay here without fainting."
 </p>
 <p>
 Mme. Delaherche had watched her son as he kissed the young woman's hair.
 She made a movement as if to part them, thinking of that other man who
 must have kissed those tresses so short a time ago; then her old hands
 trembled, she murmured beneath her breath:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What suffering all about us, <i>mon Dieu!</i> It makes one forget his
 own."
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche left them, with the assurance that he would be away no longer
 than was necessary to ascertain the true condition of affairs. In the Rue
 Maqua he was surprised to observe the crowds of soldiers that were
 streaming into the city, without arms and in torn, dust-stained uniforms.
 It was in vain, however, that he endeavored to slake his thirst for news
 by questioning them; some answered with vacant, stupid looks that they
 knew nothing, while others told long rambling stories, with the maniacal
 gestures and whirling words of one bereft of reason. He therefore
 mechanically turned his steps again toward the Sous Prefecture as the
 likeliest quarter in which to look for information. As he was passing
 along the Place du College two guns, probably all that remained of some
 battery, came dashing up to the curb on a gallop, and were abandoned
 there. When at last he turned into the Grande Rue he had further evidence
 that the advanced guards of the fugitives were beginning to take
 possession, of the city; three dismounted hussars had seated themselves in
 a doorway and were sharing a loaf of bread; two others were walking their
 mounts up and down, leading them by the bridle, not knowing where to look
 for stabling for them; officers were hurrying to and fro distractedly,
 seemingly without any distinct purpose. On the Place Turenne a lieutenant
 counseled him not to loiter unnecessarily, for the shells had an
 unpleasant way of dropping there every now and then; indeed, a splinter
 had just demolished the railing about the statue of the great commander
 who overran the Palatinate. And as if to emphasize the officer's advice,
 while he was making fast time down the Rue de la Sous Prefecture he saw
 two projectiles explode, with a terrible crash, on the Pont de Meuse.
 </p>
 <p>
 He was standing in front of the janitor's lodge, debating with himself
 whether it would be best to send in his card and try to interview one of
 the aides-de-camp, when he heard a girlish voice calling him by name.
 </p>
 <p>
 "M. Delaherche! Come in here, quick; it is not safe out there."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Rose, his little operative, whose existence he had quite forgotten.
 She might be a useful ally in assisting him to gain access to
 headquarters; he entered the lodge and accepted her invitation to be
 seated.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Just think, mamma is down sick with the worry and confusion; she can't
 leave her bed, so, you see, I have to attend to everything, for papa is
 with the National Guards up in the citadel. A little while ago the Emperor
 left the building&mdash;I suppose he wanted to let people see he is not a
 coward&mdash;and succeeded in getting as far as the bridge down at the end
 of the street. A shell alighted right in front of him; one of his
 equerries had his horse killed under him. And then he came back&mdash;he
 couldn't do anything else, could he, now?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You must have heard some talk of how the battle is going. What do they
 say, those gentlemen upstairs?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She looked at him in surprise. Her pretty face was bright and smiling,
 with its fluffy golden hair and the clear, childish eyes of one who
 bestirred herself among her multifarious duties, in the midst of all those
 horrors, which she did not well understand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, I know nothing. About midday I sent up a letter for Marshal MacMahon,
 but it could not be given him right away, because the Emperor was in the
 room. They were together nearly an hour, the Marshal lying on his bed, the
 Emperor close beside him seated on a chair. That much I know for certain,
 because I saw them when the door was opened."
 </p>
 <p>
 "And then, what did they say to each other?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She looked at him again, and could not help laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, I don't know; how could you expect me to? There's not a living soul
 knows what they said to each other."
 </p>
 <p>
 She was right; he made an apologetic gesture in recognition of the
 stupidity of his question. But the thought of that fateful conversation
 haunted him; the interest there was in it for him who could have heard it!
 What decision had they arrived at?
 </p>
 <p>
 "And now," Rose added, "the Emperor is back in his cabinet again, where he
 is having a conference with two generals who have just come in from the
 battlefield." She checked herself, casting a glance at the main entrance
 of the building. "See! there is one of them, now&mdash;and there comes the
 other."
 </p>
 <p>
 He hurried from the room, and in the two generals recognized Ducrot and
 Douay, whose horses were standing before the door. He watched them climb
 into their saddles and gallop away. They had hastened into the city, each
 independently of the other, after the plateau of Illy had been captured by
 the enemy, to notify the Emperor that the battle was lost. They placed the
 entire situation distinctly before him; the army and Sedan were even then
 surrounded on every side; the result could not help but be disastrous.
 </p>
 <p>
 For some minutes the Emperor continued silently to pace the floor of his
 cabinet, with the feeble, uncertain step of an invalid. There was none
 with him save an aide-de-camp, who stood by the door, erect and mute. And
 ever, to and fro, from the window to the fireplace, from the fireplace to
 the window, the sovereign tramped wearily, the inscrutable face now drawn
 and twitching spasmodically with a nervous tic. The back was bent, the
 shoulders bowed, as if the weight of his falling empire pressed on them
 more heavily, and the lifeless eyes, veiled by their heavy lids, told of
 the anguish of the fatalist who has played his last card against destiny
 and lost. Each time, however, that his walk brought him to the half-open
 window he gave a start and lingered there a second. And during one of
 those brief stoppages he faltered with trembling lips:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! those guns, those guns, that have been going since the morning!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The thunder of the batteries on la Marfee and at Frenois seemed, indeed,
 to resound with more terrific violence there than elsewhere. It was one
 continuous, uninterrupted crash, that shook the windows, nay, the very
 walls themselves; an incessant uproar that exasperated the nerves by its
 persistency. And he could not banish the reflection from his mind that, as
 the struggle was now hopeless, further resistance would be criminal. What
 would avail more bloodshed, more maiming and mangling; why add more
 corpses to the dead that were already piled high upon that bloody field?
 They were vanquished, it was all ended; then why not stop the slaughter?
 The abomination of desolation raised its voice to heaven: let it cease.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Emperor, again before the window, trembled and raised his hands to his
 ears, as if to shut out those reproachful voices.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, those guns, those guns! Will they never be silent!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Perhaps the dreadful thought of his responsibilities arose before him,
 with the vision of all those thousands of bleeding forms with which his
 errors had cumbered the earth; perhaps, again, it was but the
 compassionate impulse of the tender-hearted dreamer, of the well-meaning
 man whose mind was stocked with humanitarian theories. At the moment when
 he beheld utter ruin staring him in the face, in that frightful whirlwind
 of destruction that broke him like a reed and scattered his fortunes in
 the dust, he could yet find tears for others. Almost crazed at the thought
 of the slaughter that was mercilessly going on so near him, he felt he had
 not strength to endure it longer; each report of that accursed cannonade
 seemed to pierce his heart and intensified a thousandfold his own private
 suffering.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, those guns, those guns! they must be silenced at once, at once!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that monarch who no longer had a throne, for he had delegated all his
 functions to the Empress regent, that chief without an army, since he had
 turned over the supreme command to Marshal Bazaine, now felt that he must
 once more take the reins in his hand and be the master. Since they left
 Chalons he had kept himself in the background, had issued no orders,
 content to be a nameless nullity without recognized position, a cumbrous
 burden carried about from place to place among the baggage of his troops,
 and it was only in their hour of defeat that the Emperor reasserted itself
 in him; the one order that he was yet to give, out of the pity of his
 sorrowing heart, was to raise the white flag on the citadel to request an
 armistice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Those guns, oh! those guns! Take a sheet, someone, a tablecloth, it
 matters not what! only hasten, hasten, and see that it is done!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The aide-de-camp hurried from the room, and with unsteady steps the
 Emperor continued to pace his beat, back and forth, between the window and
 the fireplace, while still the batteries kept thundering, shaking the
 house from garret to foundation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche was still chatting with Rose in the room below when a
 non-commissioned officer of the guard came running in and interrupted
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Mademoiselle, the house is in confusion, I cannot find a servant. Can you
 let me have something from your linen closet, a white cloth of some kind?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Will a napkin answer?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no, it would not be large enough. Half of a sheet, say."
 </p>
 <p>
 Rose, eager to oblige, was already fumbling in her closet.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I don't think I have any half-sheets. No, I don't see anything that looks
 as if it would serve your purpose. Oh, here is something; could you use a
 tablecloth?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "A tablecloth! just the thing. Nothing could be better." And he added as
 he left the room: "It is to be used as a flag of truce, and hoisted on the
 citadel to let the enemy know we want to stop the fighting. Much obliged,
 mademoiselle."
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche gave a little involuntary start of delight; they were to have a
 respite at last, then! Then he thought it might be unpatriotic to be
 joyful at such a time, and put on a long face again; but none the less his
 heart was very glad and he contemplated with much interest a colonel and
 captain, followed by the sergeant, as they hurriedly left the
 Sous-Prefecture. The colonel had the tablecloth, rolled in a bundle,
 beneath his arm. He thought he should like to follow them, and took leave
 of Rose, who was very proud that her napery was to be put to such use. It
 was then just striking two o'clock.
 </p>
 <p>
 In front of the Hotel de Ville Delaherche was jostled by a disorderly mob
 of half-crazed soldiers who were pushing their way down from the Faubourg
 de la Cassine; he lost sight of the colonel, and abandoned his design of
 going to witness the raising of the white flag. He certainly would not be
 allowed to enter the citadel, and then again he had heard it reported that
 shells were falling on the college, and a new terror filled his mind; his
 factory might have been burned since he left it. All his feverish
 agitation returned to him and he started off on a run; the rapid motion
 was a relief to him. But the streets were blocked by groups of men, at
 every crossing he was delayed by some new obstacle. It was only when he
 reached the Rue Maqua and beheld the monumental facade of his house
 intact, no smoke or sign of fire about it, that his anxiety was allayed,
 and he heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction. He entered, and from the
 doorway shouted to his mother and wife:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is all right! they are hoisting the white flag; the cannonade won't
 last much longer."
 </p>
 <p>
 He said nothing more, for the appearance presented by the ambulance was
 truly horrifying.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the vast drying-room, the wide door of which was standing open, not
 only was every bed occupied, but there was no more room upon the litter
 that had been shaken down on the floor at the end of the apartment. They
 were commencing to strew straw in the spaces between the beds, the wounded
 were crowded together so closely that they were in contact. Already there
 were more than two hundred patients there, and more were arriving
 constantly; through the lofty windows the pitiless white daylight streamed
 in upon that aggregation of suffering humanity. Now and then an unguarded
 movement elicited an involuntary cry of anguish. The death-rattle rose on
 the warm, damp air. Down the room a low, mournful wail, almost a lullaby,
 went on and ceased not. And all about was silence, intense, profound, the
 stolid resignation of despair, the solemn stillness of the death-chamber,
 broken only by the tread and whispers of the attendants. Rents in
 tattered, shell-torn uniforms disclosed gaping wounds, some of which had
 received a hasty dressing on the battlefield, while others were still raw
 and bleeding. There were feet, still incased in their coarse shoes,
 crushed into a mass like jelly; from knees and elbows, that were as if
 they had been smashed by a hammer, depended inert limbs. There were broken
 hands, and fingers almost severed, ready to drop, retained only by a strip
 of skin. Most numerous among the casualties were the fractures; the poor
 arms and legs, red and swollen, throbbed intolerably and were heavy as
 lead. But the most dangerous hurts were those in the abdomen, chest, and
 head. There were yawning fissures that laid open the entire flank, the
 knotted viscera were drawn into great hard lumps beneath the tight-drawn
 skin, while as the effect of certain wounds the patient frothed at the
 mouth and writhed like an epileptic. Here and there were cases where the
 lungs had been penetrated, the puncture now so minute as to permit no
 escape of blood, again a wide, deep orifice through which the red tide of
 life escaped in torrents; and the internal hemorrhages, those that were
 hid from sight, were the most terrible in their effects, prostrating their
 victim like a flash, making him black in the face and delirious. And
 finally the head, more than any other portion of the frame, gave evidence
 of hard treatment; a broken jaw, the mouth a pulp of teeth and bleeding
 tongue, an eye torn from its socket and exposed upon the cheek, a cloven
 skull that showed the palpitating brain beneath. Those in whose case the
 bullet had touched the brain or spinal marrow were already as dead men,
 sunk in the lethargy of coma, while the fractures and other less serious
 cases tossed restlessly on their pallets and beseechingly called for water
 to quench their thirst.
 </p>
 <p>
 Leaving the large room and passing out into the courtyard, the shed where
 the operations were going on presented another scene of horror. In the
 rush and hurry that had continued unabated since morning it was impossible
 to operate on every case that was brought in, so their attention had been
 confined to those urgent cases that imperatively demanded it. Whenever
 Bouroche's rapid judgment told him that amputation was necessary, he
 proceeded at once to perform it. In the same way he lost not a moment's
 time in probing the wound and extracting the projectile whenever it had
 lodged in some locality where it might do further mischief, as in the
 muscles of the neck, the region of the arm pit, the thigh joint, the
 ligaments of the knee and elbow. Severed arteries, too, had to be tied
 without delay. Other wounds were merely dressed by one of the hospital
 stewards under his direction and left to await developments. He had
 already with his own hand performed four amputations, the only rest that
 he allowed himself being to attend to some minor cases in the intervals
 between them, and was beginning to feel fatigue. There were but two
 tables, his own and another, presided over by one of his assistants; a
 sheet had been hung between them, to isolate the patients from each other.
 Although the sponge was kept constantly at work the tables were always
 red, and the buckets that were emptied over a bed of daisies a few steps
 away, the clear water in which a single tumbler of blood sufficed to
 redden, seemed to be buckets of unmixed blood, torrents of blood,
 inundating the gentle flowers of the parterre. Although the room was
 thoroughly ventilated a nauseating smell arose from the tables and their
 horrid burdens, mingled with the sweetly insipid odor of chloroform.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche, naturally a soft-hearted man, was in a quiver of compassionate
 emotion at the spectacle that lay before his eyes, when his attention was
 attracted by a landau that drove up to the door. It was a private
 carriage, but doubtless the ambulance attendants had found none other
 ready to their hand and had crowded their patients into it. There were
 eight of them, sitting on one another's knees, and as the last man
 alighted the manufacturer recognized Captain Beaudoin, and gave utterance
 to a cry of terror and surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my poor friend! Wait, I will call my mother and my wife."
 </p>
 <p>
 They came running up, leaving the bandages to be rolled by servants. The
 attendants had already raised the captain and brought him into the room,
 and were about to lay him down upon a pile of straw when Delaherche
 noticed, lying on a bed, a soldier whose ashy face and staring eyes
 exhibited no sign of life.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look, is he not dead, that man?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's so!" replied the attendant. "He may as well make room for someone
 else!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He and one of his mates took the body by the arms and legs and carried it
 off to the morgue that had been extemporized behind the lilac bushes. A
 dozen corpses were already there in a row, stiff and stark, some drawn out
 to their full length as if in an attempt to rid themselves of the agony
 that racked them, others curled and twisted in every attitude of
 suffering. Some seemed to have left the world with a sneer on their faces,
 their eyes retroverted till naught was visible but the whites, the
 grinning lips parted over the glistening teeth, while in others, with
 faces unspeakably sorrowful, big tears still stood on the cheeks. One, a
 mere boy, short and slight, half whose face had been shot away by a
 cannon-ball, had his two hands clasped convulsively above his heart, and
 in them a woman's photograph, one of those pale, blurred pictures that are
 made in the quarters of the poor, bedabbled with his blood. And at the
 feet of the dead had been thrown in a promiscuous pile the amputated arms
 and legs, the refuse of the knife and saw of the operating table, just as
 the butcher sweeps into a corner of his shop the offal, the worthless odds
 and ends of flesh and bone.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte shuddered as she looked on Captain Beaudoin. Good God! how pale
 he was, stretched out on his mattress, his face so white beneath the
 encrusting grime! And the thought that but a few short hours before he had
 held her in his arms, radiant in all his manly strength and beauty, sent a
 chill of terror to her heart. She kneeled beside him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What a terrible misfortune, my friend! But it won't amount to anything,
 will it?" And she drew her handkerchief from her pocket and began
 mechanically to wipe his face, for she could not bear to look at it thus
 soiled with powder, sweat, and clay. It seemed to her, too, that she would
 be helping him by cleansing him a little. "Will it? it is only your leg
 that is hurt; it won't amount to anything."
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain made an effort to rouse himself from his semi-conscious state,
 and opened his eyes. He recognized his friends and greeted them with a
 faint smile.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is only the leg. I was not even aware of being hit; I thought I
 had made a misstep and fallen&mdash;" He spoke with great difficulty. "Oh!
 I am so thirsty!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Mme. Delaherche, who was standing at the other side of the mattress,
 looking down compassionately on the young man, hastily left the room. She
 returned with a glass and a carafe of water into which a little cognac had
 been poured, and when the captain had greedily swallowed the contents of
 the glass, she distributed what remained in the carafe among the occupants
 of the adjacent beds, who begged with trembling outstretched hands and
 tearful voices for a drop. A zouave, for whom there was none left, sobbed
 like a child in his disappointment.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche was meantime trying to gain the major's ear to see if he could
 not prevail on him to take up the captain's case out of its regular turn.
 Bouroche came into the room just then, with his blood-stained apron and
 lion's mane hanging in confusion about his perspiring face, and the men
 raised their heads as he passed and endeavored to stop him, all clamoring
 at once for recognition and immediate attention: "This way, major! It's my
 turn, major!" Faltering words of entreaty went up to him, trembling hands
 clutched at his garments, but he, wrapped up in the work that lay before
 him and puffing with his laborious exertions, continued to plan and
 calculate and listened to none of them. He communed with himself aloud,
 counting them over with his finger and classifying them, assigning them
 their numbers; this one first, then that one, then that other fellow; one,
 two, three; the jaw, the arm, then the thigh; while the assistant who
 accompanied him on his round made himself all ears in his effort to
 memorize his directions.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Major," said Delaherche, plucking him by the sleeve, "there is an officer
 over here, Captain Beaudoin&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche interrupted him. "What, Beaudoin here! Ah, the poor devil!" And
 he crossed over at once to the side of the wounded man. A single glance,
 however, must have sufficed to show him that the case was a bad one, for
 he added in the same breath, without even stooping to examine the injured
 member: "Good! I will have them bring him to me at once, just as soon as I
 am through with the operation that is now in hand."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went back to the shed, followed by Delaherche, who would not lose
 sight of him for fear lest he might forget his promise.
 </p>
 <p>
 The business that lay before him now was the rescision of a shoulder-joint
 in accordance with Lisfranc's method, which surgeons never fail to speak
 of as a "very pretty" operation, something neat and expeditious, barely
 occupying forty seconds in the performance. The patient was subjected to
 the influence of chloroform, while an assistant grasped the shoulder with
 both hands, the fingers under the armpit, the thumbs on top. Bouroche,
 brandishing the long, keen knife, cried: "Raise him!" seized the deltoid
 with his left hand and with a swift movement of the right cut through the
 flesh of the arm and severed the muscle; then, with a deft rearward cut,
 he disarticulated the joint at a single stroke, and presto! the arm fell
 on the table, taken off in three motions. The assistant slipped his thumbs
 over the brachial artery in such manner as to close it. "Let him down!"
 Bouroche could not restrain a little pleased laugh as he proceeded to
 secure the artery, for he had done it in thirty-five seconds. All that was
 left to do now was to bring a flap of skin down over the wound and stitch
 it, in appearance something like a flat epaulette. It was not only
 "pretty," but exciting, on account of the danger, for a man will pump all
 the blood out of his body in two minutes through the brachial, to say
 nothing of the risk there is in bringing a patient to a sitting posture
 when under the influence of anaesthetics.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche was white as a ghost; a thrill of horror ran down his back. He
 would have turned and fled, but time was not given him; the arm was
 already off. The soldier was a new recruit, a sturdy peasant lad; on
 emerging from his state of coma he beheld a hospital attendant carrying
 away the amputated limb to conceal it behind the lilacs. Giving a quick
 downward glance at his shoulder, he saw the bleeding stump and knew what
 had been done, whereon he became furiously angry.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>nom de Dieu!</i> what have you been doing to me? It is a shame!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche was too done up to make him an immediate answer, but presently,
 in his fatherly way:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I acted for the best; I didn't want to see you kick the bucket, my boy.
 Besides, I asked you, and you told me to go ahead."
 </p>
 <p>
 "I told you to go ahead! I did? How could I know what I was saying!" His
 anger subsided and he began to weep scalding tears. "What is going to
 become of me now?"
 </p>
 <p>
 They carried him away and laid him on the straw, and gave the table and
 its covering a thorough cleansing; and the buckets of blood-red water that
 they threw out across the grass plot gave to the pale daisies a still
 deeper hue of crimson.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Delaherche had in some degree recovered his equanimity he was
 astonished to notice that the bombardment was still going on. Why had it
 not been silenced? Rose's tablecloth must have been hoisted over the
 citadel by that time, and yet it seemed as if the fire of the Prussian
 batteries was more rapid and furious than ever. The uproar was such that
 one could not hear his own voice; the sustained vibration tried the
 stoutest nerves. On both operators and patients the effect could not but
 be most unfavorable of those incessant detonations that seemed to
 penetrate the inmost recesses of one's being. The entire hospital was in a
 state of feverish alarm and apprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I supposed it was all over; what can they mean by keeping it up?"
 exclaimed Delaherche, who was nervously listening, expecting each shot
 would be the last.
 </p>
 <p>
 Returning to Bouroche to remind him of his promise and conduct him to the
 captain, he was astonished to find him seated on a bundle of straw before
 two pails of iced water, into which he had plunged both his arms, bared to
 the shoulder. The major, weary and disheartened, overwhelmed by a
 sensation of deepest melancholy and dejection, had reached one of those
 terrible moments when the practitioner becomes conscious of his own
 impotency; he had exhausted his strength, physical and moral, and taken
 this means to restore it. And yet he was not a weakling; he was steady of
 hand and firm of heart; but the inexorable question had presented itself
 to him: "What is the use?" The feeling that he could accomplish so little,
 that so much must be left undone, had suddenly paralyzed him. What was the
 use? since Death, in spite of his utmost effort, would always be
 victorious. Two attendants came in, bearing Captain Beaudoin on a
 stretcher.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Major," Delaherche ventured to say, "here is the captain."
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche opened his eyes, withdrew his arms from their cold bath, shook
 and dried them on the straw. Then, rising to his feet:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes; the next one&mdash;Well, well, the day's work is not yet done."
 And he shook the tawny locks upon his lion's head, rejuvenated and
 refreshed, restored to himself once more by the invincible habit of duty
 and the stern discipline of his profession.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good! just above the right ankle," said Bouroche, with unusual garrulity,
 intended to quiet the nerves of the patient. "You displayed wisdom in
 selecting the location of your wound; one is not much the worse for a hurt
 in that quarter. Now we'll just take a little look at it."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Beaudoin's persistently lethargic condition evidently alarmed him. He
 inspected the contrivance that had been applied by the field attendant to
 check the flow of blood, which was simply a cord passed around the leg
 outside the trousers and twisted tight with the assistance of a bayonet
 sheath, with a growling request to be informed what infernal ignoramus had
 done that. Then suddenly he saw how matters were and was silent; while
 they were bringing him in from the field in the overcrowded landau the
 improvised tourniquet had become loosened and slipped down, thus giving
 rise to an extensive hemorrhage. He relieved his feelings by storming at
 the hospital steward who was assisting him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You confounded snail, cut! Are you going to keep me here all day?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The attendant cut away the trousers and drawers, then the shoe and sock,
 disclosing to view the leg and foot in their pale nudity, stained with
 blood. Just over the ankle was a frightful laceration, into which the
 splinter of the bursting shell had driven a piece of the red cloth of the
 trousers. The muscle protruded from the lips of the gaping orifice, a roll
 of whitish, mangled tissue.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte had to support herself against one of the uprights of the shed.
 Ah! that flesh, that poor flesh that was so white; now all torn and maimed
 and bleeding! Despite the horror and terror of the sight she could not
 turn away her eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Confound it!" Bouroche exclaimed, "they have made a nice mess here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He felt the foot and found it cold; the pulse, if any, was so feeble as to
 be undistinguishable. His face was very grave, and he pursed his lips in a
 way that was habitual with him when he had a more than usually serious
 case to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Confound it," he repeated, "I don't like the looks of that foot!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain, whom his anxiety had finally aroused from his semi-somnolent
 state, asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What were you saying, major?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche's tactics, whenever an amputation became necessary, were never to
 appeal directly to the patient for the customary authorization. He
 preferred to have the patient accede to it voluntarily.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I was saying that I don't like the looks of that foot," he murmured, as
 if thinking aloud. "I am afraid we shan't be able to save it."
 </p>
 <p>
 In a tone of alarm Beaudoin rejoined: "Come, major, there is no use
 beating about the bush. What is your opinion?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "My opinion is that you are a brave man, captain, and that you are going
 to let me do what the necessity of the case demands."
 </p>
 <p>
 To Captain Beaudoin it seemed as if a sort of reddish vapor arose before
 his eyes through which he saw things obscurely. He understood. But
 notwithstanding the intolerable fear that appeared to be clutching at his
 throat, he replied, unaffectedly and bravely:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do as you think best, major."
 </p>
 <p>
 The preparations did not consume much time. The assistant had saturated a
 cloth with chloroform and was holding it in readiness; it was at once
 applied to the patient's nostrils. Then, just at the moment that the brief
 struggle set in that precedes anaesthesia, two attendants raised the
 captain and placed him on the mattress upon his back, in such a position
 that the legs should be free; one of them retained his grasp on the left
 limb, holding it flexed, while an assistant, seizing the right, clasped it
 tightly with both his hands in the region of the groin in order to
 compress the arteries.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte, when she saw Bouroche approach the victim with the glittering
 steel, could endure no more.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't! oh, don't! it is too horrible!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And she would have fallen had it not been that Mme. Delaherche put forth
 her arm to sustain her.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But why do you stay here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Both the women remained, however. They averted their eyes, not wishing to
 see the rest; motionless and trembling they stood locked in each other's
 arms, notwithstanding the little love there was between them.
 </p>
 <p>
 At no time during the day had the artillery thundered more loudly than
 now. It was three o'clock, and Delaherche declared angrily that he gave it
 up&mdash;he could not understand it. There could be no doubt about it now,
 the Prussian batteries, instead of slackening their fire, were extending
 it. Why? What had happened? It was as if all the forces of the nether
 regions had been unchained; the earth shook, the heavens were on fire. The
 ring of flame-belching mouths of bronze that encircled Sedan, the eight
 hundred guns of the German armies, that were served with such activity and
 raised such an uproar, were expending their thunders on the adjacent
 fields; had that concentric fire been focused upon the city, had the
 batteries on those commanding heights once begun to play upon Sedan, it
 would have been reduced to ashes and pulverized into dust in less than
 fifteen minutes. But now the projectiles were again commencing to fall
 upon the houses, the crash that told of ruin and destruction was heard
 more frequently. One exploded in the Rue des Voyards, another grazed the
 tall chimney of the factory, and the bricks and mortar came tumbling to
 the ground directly in front of the shed where the surgeons were at work.
 Bouroche looked up and grumbled:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are they trying to finish our wounded for us? Really, this racket is
 intolerable."
 </p>
 <p>
 In the meantime an attendant had seized the captain's leg, and the major,
 with a swift circular motion of his hand, made an incision in the skin
 below the knee and some two inches below the spot where he intended to saw
 the bone; then, still employing the same thin-bladed knife, that he did
 not change in order to get on more rapidly, he loosened the skin on the
 superior side of the incision and turned it back, much as one would peel
 an orange. But just as he was on the point of dividing the muscles a
 hospital steward came up and whispered in his ear:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Number two has just slipped his cable."
 </p>
 <p>
 The major did not hear, owing to the fearful uproar.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Speak up, can't you! My ear drums are broken with their d&mdash;&mdash;-d
 cannon."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Number two has just slipped his cable."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who is that, number two?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "The arm, you know."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, very good! Well, then, you can bring me number three, the jaw."
 </p>
 <p>
 And with wonderful dexterity, never changing his position, he cut through
 the muscles clean down to the bone with a single motion of his wrist. He
 laid bare the tibia and fibula, introduced between them an implement to
 keep them in position, drew the saw across them once, and they were
 sundered. And the foot remained in the hands of the attendant who was
 holding it.
 </p>
 <p>
 The flow of blood had been small, thanks to the pressure maintained by the
 assistant higher up the leg, at the thigh. The ligature of the three
 arteries was quickly accomplished, but the major shook his head, and when
 the assistant had removed his fingers he examined the stump, murmuring,
 certain that the patient could not hear as yet:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It looks bad; there's no blood coming from the arterioles."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he completed his diagnosis of the case by an expressive gesture:
 Another poor fellow who was soon to answer the great roll-call! while on
 his perspiring face was again seen that expression of weariness and utter
 dejection, that hopeless, unanswerable: "What is the use?" since out of
 every ten cases that they assumed the terrible responsibility of operating
 on they did not succeed in saving four. He wiped his forehead, and set to
 work to draw down the flap of skin and put in the three sutures that were
 to hold it in place.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche having told Gilberte that the operation was completed, she
 turned her gaze once more upon the table; she caught a glimpse of the
 captain's foot, however, as the attendant was carrying it away to the
 place behind the lilacs. The charnel house there continued to receive
 fresh occupants; two more corpses had recently been brought in and added
 to the ghastly array, one with blackened lips still parted wide as if
 rending the air with shrieks of anguish, the other, his form so contorted
 and contracted in the convulsions of the last agony that he was like a
 stunted, malformed boy. Unfortunately, there was beginning to be a
 scarcity of room in the little secluded corner, and the human debris had
 commenced to overflow and invade the adjacent alley. The attendant
 hesitated a moment, in doubt what to do with the captain's foot, then
 finally concluded to throw it on the general pile.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, captain, that's over with," the major said to Beaudoin when he
 regained consciousness. "You'll be all right now."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the captain did not show the cheeriness that follows a successful
 operation. He opened his eyes and made an attempt to raise himself, then
 fell back on his pillow, murmuring wearily, in a faint voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thanks, major. I'm glad it's over."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was conscious of the pain, however, when the alcohol of the dressing
 touched the raw flesh. He flinched a little, complaining that they were
 burning him. And just as they were bringing up the stretcher preparatory
 to carrying him back into the other room the factory was shaken to its
 foundations by a most terrific explosion; a shell had burst directly in
 the rear of the shed, in the small courtyard where the pump was situated.
 The glass in the windows was shattered into fragments, and a dense cloud
 of smoke came pouring into the ambulance. The wounded men, stricken with
 panic terror, arose from their bed of straw; all were clamoring with
 affright; all wished to fly at once.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche rushed from the building in consternation to see what damage
 had been done. Did they mean to burn his house down over his head? What
 did it all mean? Why did they open fire again when the Emperor had ordered
 that it should cease?
 </p>
 <p>
 "Thunder and lightning! Stir yourselves, will you!" Bouroche shouted to
 his staff, who were standing about with pallid faces, transfixed by
 terror. "Wash off the table; go and bring me in number three!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They cleansed the table; and once more the crimson contents of the buckets
 were hurled across the grass plot upon the bed of daisies, which was now a
 sodden, blood-soaked mat of flowers and verdure. And Bouroche, to relieve
 the tedium until the attendants should bring him "number three," applied
 himself to probing for a musket-ball, which, having first broken the
 patient's lower jaw, had lodged in the root of the tongue. The blood
 flowed freely and collected on his fingers in glutinous masses.
 </p>
 <p>
 Captain Beaudoin was again resting on his mattress in the large room.
 Gilberte and Mme. Delaherche had followed the stretcher when he was
 carried from the operating table, and even Delaherche, notwithstanding his
 anxiety, came in for a moment's chat.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lie here and rest a few minutes, Captain. We will have a room prepared
 for you, and you shall be our guest."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the wounded man shook off his lethargy and for a moment had command of
 his faculties.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, it is not worth while; I feel that I am going to die."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he looked at them with wide eyes, filled with the horror of death.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, Captain! why do you talk like that?" murmured Gilberte, with a
 shiver, while she forced a smile to her lips. "You will be quite well a
 month hence."
 </p>
 <p>
 He shook his head mournfully, and in the room was conscious of no presence
 save hers; on all his face was expressed his unutterable yearning for
 life, his bitter, almost craven regret that he was to be snatched away so
 young, leaving so many joys behind untasted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am going to die, I am going to die. Oh! 'tis horrible&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then suddenly he became conscious of his torn, soiled uniform and the
 grime upon his hands, and it made him feel uncomfortable to be in the
 company of women in such a state. It shamed him to show such weakness, and
 his desire to look and be the gentleman to the last restored to him his
 manhood. When he spoke again it was in a tone almost of cheerfulness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "If I have got to die, though, I would rather it should be with clean
 hands. I should count it a great kindness, madame, if you would moisten a
 napkin and let me have it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte sped away and quickly returned with the napkin, with which she
 herself cleansed the hands of the dying man. Thenceforth, desirous of
 quitting the scene with dignity, he displayed much firmness. Delaherche
 did what he could to cheer him, and assisted his wife in the small
 attentions she offered for his comfort. Old Mme. Delaherche, too, in
 presence of the man whose hours were numbered, felt her enmity subsiding.
 She would be silent, she who knew all and had sworn to impart her
 knowledge to her son. What would it avail to excite discord in the
 household, since death would soon obliterate all trace of the wrong?
 </p>
 <p>
 The end came very soon. Captain Beaudoin, whose strength was ebbing
 rapidly, relapsed into his comatose condition, and a cold sweat broke out
 and stood in beads upon his neck and forehead. He opened his eyes again,
 and began to feebly grope about him with his stiffening fingers, as if
 feeling for a covering that was not there, pulling at it with a gentle,
 continuous movement, as if to draw it up around his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is cold&mdash;Oh! it is so cold."
 </p>
 <p>
 And so he passed from life, peacefully, without a struggle; and on his
 wasted, tranquil face rested an expression of unspeakable melancholy.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche saw to it that the remains, instead of being borne away and
 placed among the common dead, were deposited in one of the outbuildings of
 the factory. He endeavored to prevail on Gilberte, who was tearful and
 disconsolate, to retire to her apartment, but she declared that to be
 alone now would be more than her nerves could stand, and begged to be
 allowed to remain with her mother-in-law in the ambulance, where the noise
 and movement would be a distraction to her. She was seen presently running
 to carry a drink of water to a chasseur d'Afrique whom his fever had made
 delirious, and she assisted a hospital steward to dress the hand of a
 little recruit, a lad of twenty, who had had his thumb shot away and come
 in on foot from the battlefield; and as he was jolly and amusing, treating
 his wound with all the levity and nonchalance of the Parisian rollicker,
 she was soon laughing and joking as merrily as he.
 </p>
 <p>
 While the captain lay dying the cannonade seemed, if that were possible,
 to have increased in violence; another shell had landed in the garden,
 shattering one of the old elms. Terror-stricken men came running in to say
 that all Sedan was in danger of destruction; a great fire had broken out
 in the Faubourg de la Cassine. If the bombardment should continue with
 such fury for any length of time there would be nothing left of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It can't be; I am going to see about it!" Delaherche exclaimed, violently
 excited.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Where are you going, pray?" asked Bouroche.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, to the Sous-Prefecture, to see what the Emperor means by fooling us
 in this way, with his talk of hoisting the white flag."
 </p>
 <p>
 For some few seconds the major stood as if petrified at the idea of defeat
 and capitulation, which presented itself to him then for the first time in
 the midst of his impotent efforts to save the lives of the poor maimed
 creatures they were bringing in to him from the field. Rage and grief were
 in his voice as he shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go to the devil, if you will! All you can do won't keep us from being
 soundly whipped!"
 </p>
 <p>
 On leaving the factory Delaherche found it no easy task to squeeze his way
 through the throng; at every instant the crowd of straggling soldiers that
 filled the streets received fresh accessions. He questioned several of the
 officers whom he encountered; not one of them had seen the white flag on
 the citadel. Finally he met a colonel, who declared that he had caught a
 momentary glimpse of it: that it had been run up and then immediately
 hauled down. That explained matters; either the Germans had not seen it,
 or seeing it appear and disappear so quickly, had inferred the distressed
 condition of the French and redoubled their fire in consequence. There was
 a story in circulation how a general officer, enraged beyond control at
 the sight of the flag, had wrested it from its bearer, broken the staff,
 and trampled it in the mud. And still the Prussian batteries continued to
 play upon the city, shells were falling upon the roofs and in the streets,
 houses were in flames; a woman had just been killed at the corner of the
 Rue Pont de Meuse and the Place Turenne.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the Sous-Prefecture Delaherche failed to find Rose at her usual station
 in the janitor's lodge. Everywhere were evidences of disorder; all the
 doors were standing open; the reign of terror had commenced. As there was
 no sentry or anyone to prevent, he went upstairs, encountering on the way
 only a few scared-looking men, none of whom made any offer to stop him. He
 had reached the first story and was hesitating what to do next when he saw
 the young girl approaching him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, M. Delaherche! isn't this dreadful! Here, quick! this way, if you
 would like to see the Emperor."
 </p>
 <p>
 On the left of the corridor a door stood ajar, and through the narrow
 opening a glimpse could be had of the sovereign, who had resumed his
 weary, anguished tramp between the fireplace and the window. Back and
 forth he shuffled with heavy, dragging steps, and ceased not, despite his
 unendurable suffering. An aide-de-camp had just entered the room&mdash;it
 was he who had failed to close the door behind him&mdash;and Delaherche
 heard the Emperor ask him in a sorrowfully reproachful voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is the reason of this continued firing, sir, after I gave orders to
 hoist the white flag?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The torture to him had become greater than he could bear, that
 never-ceasing cannonade, that seemed to grow more furious with every
 minute. Every time he approached the window it pierced him to the heart.
 More spilling of blood, more useless squandering of human life! At every
 moment the piles of corpses were rising higher on the battlefield, and his
 was the responsibility. The compassionate instincts that entered so
 largely into his nature revolted at it, and more than ten times already he
 had asked that question of those who approached him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I gave orders to raise the white flag; tell me, why do they continue
 firing?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The aide-de-camp made answer in a voice so low that Delaherche failed to
 catch its purport. The Emperor, moreover, seemed not to pause to listen,
 drawn by some irresistible attraction to that window at which, each time
 he approached it, he was greeted by that terrible salvo of artillery that
 rent and tore his being. His pallor was greater even than it had been
 before; his poor, pinched, wan face, on which were still visible traces of
 the rouge that had been applied that morning, bore witness to his anguish.
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment a short, quick-motioned man in dust-soiled uniform, whom
 Delaherche recognized as General Lebrun, hurriedly crossed the corridor
 and pushed open the door, without waiting to be announced. And scarcely
 was he in the room when again was heard the Emperor's so oft repeated
 question.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why do they continue to fire, General, when I have given orders to hoist
 the white flag?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The aide-de-camp left the apartment, shutting the door behind him, and
 Delaherche never knew what was the general's answer. The vision had faded
 from his sight.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Rose, "things are going badly; I can see that clearly enough by
 all those gentlemen's faces. It is bad for my tablecloth, too; I am afraid
 I shall never see it again; somebody told me it had been torn in pieces.
 But it is for the Emperor that I feel most sorry in all this business, for
 he is in a great deal worse condition than the marshal; he would be much
 better off in his bed than in that room, where he is wearing himself out
 with his everlasting walking."
 </p>
 <p>
 She spoke with much feeling, and on her pretty pink and white face there
 was an expression of sincere pity, but Delaherche, whose Bonapartist ardor
 had somehow cooled considerably during the last two days, said to himself
 that she was a little fool. He nevertheless remained chatting with her a
 moment in the hall below while waiting for General Lebrun to take his
 departure, and when that officer appeared and left the building he
 followed him.
 </p>
 <p>
 General Lebrun had explained to the Emperor that if it was thought best to
 apply for an armistice, etiquette demanded that a letter to that effect,
 signed by the commander-in-chief of the French forces, should be
 dispatched to the German commander-in-chief. He had also offered to write
 the letter, go in search of General de Wimpffen, and obtain his signature
 to it. He left the Sous-Prefecture with the letter in his pocket, but
 apprehensive he might not succeed in finding de Wimpffen, entirely
 ignorant as he was of the general's whereabouts on the field of battle.
 Within the ramparts of Sedan, moreover, the crowd was so dense that he was
 compelled to walk his horse, which enabled Delaherche to keep him in sight
 until he reached the Minil gate.
 </p>
 <p>
 Once outside upon the road, however, General Lebrun struck into a gallop,
 and when near Balan had the good fortune to fall in with the chief. Only a
 few minutes previous to this the latter had written to the Emperor: "Sire,
 come and put yourself at the head of your troops; they will force a
 passage through the enemy's lines for you, or perish in the attempt;"
 therefore he flew into a furious passion at the mere mention of the word
 armistice. No, no! he would sign nothing, he would fight it out! This was
 about half-past three o'clock, and it was shortly afterward that occurred
 the gallant, but mad attempt, the last serious effort of the day, to
 pierce the Bavarian lines and regain possession of Bazeilles. In order to
 put heart into the troops a ruse was resorted to: in the streets of Sedan
 and in the fields outside the walls the shout was raised: "Bazaine is
 coming up! Bazaine is at hand!" Ever since morning many had allowed
 themselves to be deluded by that hope; each time that the Germans opened
 fire with a fresh battery it was confidently asserted to be the guns of
 the army of Metz. In the neighborhood of twelve hundred men were
 collected, soldiers of all arms, from every corps, and the little column
 bravely advanced into the storm of missiles that swept the road, at double
 time. It was a splendid spectacle of heroism and endurance while it
 lasted; the numerous casualties did not check the ardor of the survivors,
 nearly five hundred yards were traversed with a courage and nerve that
 seemed almost like madness; but soon there were great gaps in the ranks,
 the bravest began to fall back. What could they do against overwhelming
 numbers? It was a mad attempt, anyway; the desperate effort of a commander
 who could not bring himself to acknowledge that he was defeated. And it
 ended by General de Wimpffen finding himself and General Lebrun alone
 together on the Bazeilles road, which they had to make up their mind to
 abandon to the enemy, for good and all. All that remained for them to do
 was to retreat and seek security under the walls of Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 Upon losing sight of the general at the Minil gate Delaherche had hurried
 back to the factory at the best speed he was capable of, impelled by an
 irresistible longing to have another look from his observatory at what was
 going on in the distance. Just as he reached his door, however, his
 progress was arrested a moment by encountering Colonel de Vineuil, who,
 with his blood-stained boot, was being brought in for treatment in a
 condition of semi-consciousness, upon a bed of straw that had been
 prepared for him on the floor of a market-gardener's wagon. The colonel
 had persisted in his efforts to collect the scattered fragments of his
 regiment until he dropped from his horse. He was immediately carried
 upstairs and put to bed in a room on the first floor, and Bouroche, who
 was summoned at once, finding the injury not of a serious character, had
 only to apply a dressing to the wound, from which he first extracted some
 bits of the leather of the boot. The worthy doctor was wrought up to a
 high pitch of excitement; he exclaimed, as he went downstairs, that he
 would rather cut off one of his own legs than continue working in that
 unsatisfactory, slovenly way, without a tithe of either the assistants or
 the appliances that he ought to have. Below in the ambulance, indeed, they
 no longer knew where to bestow the cases that were brought them, and had
 been obliged to have recourse to the lawn, where they laid them on the
 grass. There were already two long rows of them, exposed beneath the
 shrieking shells, filling the air with their dismal plaints while waiting
 for his ministrations. The number of cases brought in since noon exceeded
 four hundred, and in response to Bouroche's repeated appeals for
 assistance he had been sent one young doctor from the city. Good as was
 his will, he was unequal to the task; he probed, sliced, sawed, sewed like
 a man frantic, and was reduced to despair to see his work continually
 accumulating before him. Gilberte, satiated with sights of horror, unable
 longer to endure the sad spectacle of blood and tears, remained upstairs
 with her uncle, the colonel, leaving to Mme. Delaherche the care of
 moistening fevered lips and wiping the cold sweat from the brow of the
 dying.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rapidly climbing the stairs to his terrace, Delaherche endeavored to form
 some idea for himself of how matters stood. The city had suffered less
 injury than was generally supposed; there was one great conflagration,
 however, over in the Faubourg de la Cassine, from which dense volumes of
 smoke were rising. Fort Palatinat had discontinued its fire, doubtless
 because the ammunition was all expended; the guns mounted on the Porte de
 Paris alone continued to make themselves heard at infrequent intervals.
 But something that he beheld presently had greater interest for his eyes
 than all beside; they had run up the white flag on the citadel again, but
 it must be that it was invisible from the battlefield, for there was no
 perceptible slackening of the fire. The Balan road was concealed from his
 vision by the neighboring roofs; he was unable to make out what the troops
 were doing in that direction. Applying his eye to the telescope, however,
 which remained as he had left it, directed on la Marfee, he again beheld
 the cluster of officers that he had seen in that same place about midday.
 The master of them all, that miniature toy-soldier in lead, half finger
 high, in whom he had thought to recognize the King of Prussia, was there
 still, erect in his plain, dark uniform before the other officers, who, in
 their showy trappings, were for the most part reclining carelessly on the
 grass. Among them were officers from foreign lands, aides-de-camp,
 generals, high officials, princes; all of them with field glasses in their
 hands, with which, since early morning, they had been watching every phase
 of the death-struggle of the army of Chalons, as if they were at the play.
 And the direful drama was drawing to its end.
 </p>
 <p>
 From among the trees that clothed the summit of la Marfee King William had
 just witnessed the junction of his armies. It was an accomplished fact;
 the third army, under the leadership of his son, the Crown Prince,
 advancing by the way of Saint-Menges and Fleigneux, had secured possession
 of the plateau of Illy, while the fourth, commanded by the Crown Prince of
 Saxony, turning the wood of la Garenne and, coming up through Givonne and
 Daigny, had also reached its appointed rendezvous. There, too, the XIth
 and Vth corps had joined hands with the XIIth corps and the Guards. The
 gallant but ineffectual charge of Margueritte's division in its supreme
 effort to break through the hostile lines at the very moment when the
 circle was being rounded out had elicited from the king the exclamation:
 "Ah, the brave fellows!" Now the great movement, inexorable as fate, the
 details of which had been arranged with such mathematical precision, was
 complete, the jaws of the vise had closed, and stretching on his either
 hand far in the distance, a mighty wall of adamant surrounding the army of
 the French, were the countless men and guns that called him master. At the
 north the contracting lines maintained a constantly increasing pressure on
 the vanquished, forcing them back upon Sedan under the merciless fire of
 the batteries that lined the horizon in an array without a break. Toward
 the south, at Bazeilles, where the conflict had ceased to rage and the
 scene was one of mournful desolation, great clouds of smoke were rising
 from the ruins of what had once been happy homes, while the Bavarians, now
 masters of Balan, had advanced their batteries to within three hundred
 yards of the city gates. And the other batteries, those posted on the left
 bank at Pont Maugis, Noyers, Frenois, Wadelincourt, completing the
 impenetrable rampart of flame and bringing it around to the sovereign's
 feet on his right, that had been spouting fire uninterruptedly for nearly
 twelve hours, now thundered more loudly still.
 </p>
 <p>
 But King William, to give his tired eyes a moment's rest, dropped his
 glass to his side and continued his observations with unassisted vision.
 The sun was slanting downward to the woods on his left, about to set in a
 sky where there was not a cloud, and the golden light that lay upon the
 landscape was so transcendently clear and limpid that the most
 insignificant objects stood out with startling distinctness. He could
 almost count the houses in Sedan, whose windows flashed back the level
 rays of the departing day-star, and the ramparts and fortifications,
 outlined in black against the eastern sky, had an unwonted aspect of
 frowning massiveness. Then, scattered among the fields to right and left,
 were the pretty, smiling villages, reminding one of the toy villages that
 come packed in boxes for the little ones; to the west Donchery, seated at
 the border of her broad plain; Douzy and Carignan to the east, among the
 meadows. Shutting in the picture to the north was the forest of the
 Ardennes, an ocean of sunlit verdure, while the Meuse, loitering with
 sluggish current through the plain with many a bend and curve, was like a
 stream of purest molten gold in that caressing light. And seen from that
 height, with the sun's parting kiss resting on it, the horrible
 battlefield, with its blood and smoke, became an exquisite and highly
 finished miniature; the dead horsemen and disemboweled steeds on the
 plateau of Floing were so many splashes of bright color; on the right, in
 the direction of Givonne, those minute black specks that whirled and
 eddied with such apparent lack of aim, like motes dancing in the sunshine,
 were the retreating fragments of the beaten army; while on the left a
 Bavarian battery on the peninsula of Iges, its guns the size of matches,
 might have been taken for some mechanical toy as it performed its
 evolutions with clockwork regularity. The victory was crushing, exceeding
 all that the victor could have desired or hoped, and the King felt no
 remorse in presence of all those corpses, of those thousands of men that
 were as the dust upon the roads of that broad valley where,
 notwithstanding the burning of Bazeilles, the slaughter of Illy, the
 anguish of Sedan, impassive nature yet could don her gayest robe and put
 on her brightest smile as the perfect day faded into the tranquil evening.
 </p>
 <p>
 But suddenly Delaherche descried a French officer climbing the steep path
 up the flank of la Marfee; he was a general, wearing a blue tunic, mounted
 on a black horse, and preceded by a hussar bearing a white flag. It was
 General Reille, whom the Emperor had entrusted with this communication for
 the King of Prussia: "My brother, as it has been denied me to die at the
 head of my army, all that is left me is to surrender my sword to Your
 Majesty. I am Your Majesty's affectionate brother, Napoleon." Desiring to
 arrest the butchery and being no longer master, the Emperor yielded
 himself a prisoner, in the hope to placate the conqueror by the sacrifice.
 And Delaherche saw General Reille rein up his charger and dismount at ten
 paces from the King, then advance and deliver his letter; he was unarmed
 and merely carried a riding whip. The sun was setting in a flood of rosy
 light; the King seated himself on a chair in the midst of a grassy open
 space, and resting his hand on the back of another chair that was held in
 place by a secretary, replied that he accepted the sword and would await
 the appearance of an officer empowered to settle the terms of the
 capitulation.

 <h2>
 VII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 As when the ice breaks up and the great cakes come crashing, grinding down
 upon the bosom of the swollen stream, carrying away all before them, so
 now, from every position about Sedan that had been wrested from the
 French, from Floing and the plateau of Illy, from the wood of la Garenne,
 the valley of la Givonne and the Bazeilles road, the stampede commenced; a
 mad torrent of horses, guns, and affrighted men came pouring toward the
 city. It was a most unfortunate inspiration that brought the army under
 the walls of that fortified place. There was too much in the way of
 temptation there; the shelter that it afforded the skulker and the
 deserter, the assurance of safety that even the bravest beheld behind its
 ramparts, entailed widespread panic and demoralization. Down there behind
 those protecting walls, so everyone imagined, was safety from that
 terrible artillery that had been blazing without intermission for near
 twelve hours; duty, manhood, reason were all lost sight of; the man
 disappeared and was succeeded by the brute, and their fierce instinct sent
 them racing wildly for shelter, seeking a place where they might hide
 their head and lie down and sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice, bathing Jean's face with cool water behind the shelter of
 their bit of wall, saw his friend open his eyes once more, he uttered an
 exclamation of delight.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, poor old chap, I was beginning to fear you were done for! And don't
 think I say it to find fault, but really you are not so light as you were
 when you were a boy."
 </p>
 <p>
 It seemed to Jean, in his still dazed condition, that he was awaking from
 some unpleasant dream. Then his recollection returned to him slowly, and
 two big tears rolled down his cheeks. To think that little Maurice, so
 frail and slender, whom he had loved and petted like a child, should have
 found strength to lug him all that distance!
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let's see what damage your knowledge-box has sustained."
 </p>
 <p>
 The wound was not serious; the bullet had plowed its way through the scalp
 and considerable blood had flowed. The hair, which was now matted with the
 coagulated gore, had served to stanch the current, therefore Maurice
 refrained from applying water to the hurt, so as not to cause it to bleed
 afresh.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There, you look a little more like a civilized being, now that you have a
 clean face on you. Let's see if I can find something for you to wear on
 your head." And picking up the <i>kepi</i> of a soldier who lay dead not
 far away, he tenderly adjusted it on his comrade. "It fits you to a T. Now
 if you can only walk everyone will say we are a very good-looking couple."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean got on his legs and gave his head a shake to assure himself it was
 secure. It seemed a little heavier than usual, that was all; he thought he
 should get along well enough. A great wave of tenderness swept through his
 simple soul; he caught Maurice in his arms and hugged him to his bosom,
 while all he could find to say was:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! dear boy, dear boy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the Prussians were drawing near: it would not answer to loiter behind
 the wall. Already Lieutenant Rochas, with what few men were left him, was
 retreating, guarding the flag, which the sous-lieutenant still carried
 under his arm, rolled around the staff. Lapoulle's great height enabled
 him to fire an occasional shot at the advancing enemy over the coping of
 the wall, while Pache had slung his chassepot across his shoulder by the
 strap, doubtless considering that he had done a fair day's work and it was
 time to eat and sleep. Maurice and Jean, stooping until they were bent
 almost double, hastened to rejoin them. There was no scarcity of muskets
 and ammunition; all they had to do was stoop and pick them up. They
 equipped themselves afresh, having left everything behind, knapsacks
 included, when one lugged the other out of danger on his shoulders. The
 wall extended to the wood of la Garenne, and the little band, believing
 that now their safety was assured, made a rush for the protection afforded
 by some farm buildings, whence they readily gained the shelter of the
 trees.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Rochas, drawing a long breath, "we will remain here a moment
 and get our wind before we resume the offensive." No adversity could shake
 his unwavering faith.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had not advanced many steps before all felt that they were entering
 the valley of death, but it was useless to think of retracing their steps;
 their only line of retreat lay through the wood, and cross it they must,
 at every hazard. At that time, instead of la Garenne, its more fitting
 name would have been the wood of despair and death; the Prussians, knowing
 that the French troops were retiring in that direction, were riddling it
 with artillery and musketry. Its shattered branches tossed and groaned as
 if enduring the scourging of a mighty tempest. The shells hewed down the
 stalwart trees, the bullets brought the leaves fluttering to the earth in
 showers; wailing voices seemed to issue from the cleft trunks, sobs
 accompanied the little twigs as they fell bleeding from the parent stem.
 It might have been taken for the agony of some vast multitude, held there
 in chains and unable to flee under the pelting of that pitiless iron hail;
 the shrieks, the terror of thousands of creatures rooted to the ground.
 Never was anguish so poignant as of that bombarded forest.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean, who by this time had caught up with their companions,
 were greatly alarmed. The wood where they then were was a growth of large
 trees, and there was no obstacle to their running, but the bullets came
 whistling about their ears from every direction, making it impossible for
 them to avail themselves of the shelter of the trunks. Two men were
 killed, one of them struck in the back, the other in front. A venerable
 oak, directly in Maurice's path, had its trunk shattered by a shell, and
 sank, with the stately grace of a mailed paladin, carrying down all before
 it, and even as the young man was leaping back the top of a gigantic ash
 on his left, struck by another shell, came crashing to the ground like
 some tall cathedral spire. Where could they fly? whither bend their steps?
 Everywhere the branches were falling; it was as one who should endeavor to
 fly from some vast edifice menaced with destruction, only to find himself
 in each room he enters in succession confronted with crumbling walls and
 ceilings. And when, in order to escape being crushed by the big trees,
 they took refuge in a thicket of bushes, Jean came near being killed by a
 projectile, only it fortunately failed to explode. They could no longer
 make any progress now on account of the dense growth of the shrubbery; the
 supple branches caught them around the shoulders, the rank, tough grass
 held them by the ankles, impenetrable walls of brambles rose before them
 and blocked their way, while all the time the foliage was fluttering down
 about them, clipped by the gigantic scythe that was mowing down the wood.
 Another man was struck dead beside them by a bullet in the forehead, and
 he retained his erect position, caught in some vines between two small
 birch trees. Twenty times, while they were prisoners in that thicket, did
 they feel death hovering over them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Holy Virgin!" said Maurice, "we shall never get out of this alive."
 </p>
 <p>
 His face was ashy pale, he was shivering again with terror; and Jean,
 always so brave, who had cheered and comforted him that morning, he, also,
 was very white and felt a strange, chill sensation creeping down his
 spine. It was fear, horrible, contagious, irresistible fear. Again they
 were conscious of a consuming thirst, an intolerable dryness of the mouth,
 a contraction of the throat, painful as if someone were choking them.
 These symptoms were accompanied by nausea and qualms at the pit of the
 stomach, while maleficent goblins kept puncturing their aguish, trembling
 legs with needles. Another of the physical effects of their fear was that
 in the congested condition of the blood vessels of the retina they beheld
 thousands upon thousands of small black specks flitting past them, as if
 it had been possible to distinguish the flying bullets.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Confound the luck!" Jean stammered. "It is not worth speaking of, but
 it's vexatious all the same, to be here getting one's head broken for
 other folks, when those other folks are at home, smoking their pipe in
 comfort."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, that's so," Maurice replied, with a wild look. "Why should it be I
 rather than someone else?"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the revolt of the individual Ego, the unaltruistic refusal of the
 one to make himself a sacrifice for the benefit of the species.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And then again," Jean continued, "if a fellow could but know the rights
 of the matter; if he could be sure that any good was to come from it all."
 Then turning his head and glancing at the western sky: "Anyway, I wish
 that blamed sun would hurry up and go to roost. Perhaps they'll stop
 fighting when it's dark."
 </p>
 <p>
 With no distinct idea of what o'clock it was and no means of measuring the
 flight of time, he had long been watching the tardy declination of the
 fiery disk, which seemed to him to have ceased to move, hanging there in
 the heavens over the woods of the left bank. And this was not owing to any
 lack of courage on his part; it was simply the overmastering, ever
 increasing desire, amounting to an imperious necessity, to be relieved
 from the screaming and whistling of those projectiles, to run away
 somewhere and find a hole where he might hide his head and lose himself in
 oblivion. Were it not for the feeling of shame that is implanted in men's
 breasts and keeps them from showing the white feather before their
 comrades, every one of them would lose his head and run, in spite of
 himself, like the veriest poltroon.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean, meanwhile, were becoming somewhat more accustomed to
 their surroundings, and even when their terror was at its highest there
 came to them a sort of exalted self-unconsciousness that had in it
 something of bravery. They finally reached a point when they did not even
 hasten their steps as they made their way through the accursed wood. The
 horror of the bombardment was even greater than it had been previously
 among that race of sylvan denizens, killed at their post, struck down on
 every hand, like gigantic, faithful sentries. In the delicious twilight
 that reigned, golden-green, beneath their umbrageous branches, among the
 mysterious recesses of romantic, moss-carpeted retreats, Death showed his
 ill-favored, grinning face. The solitary fountains were contaminated; men
 fell dead in distant nooks whose depths had hitherto been trod by none
 save wandering lovers. A bullet pierced a man's chest; he had time to
 utter the one word: "hit!" and fell forward on his face, stone dead. Upon
 the lips of another, who had both legs broken by a shell, the gay laugh
 remained; unconscious of his hurt, he supposed he had tripped over a root.
 Others, injured mortally, would run on for some yards, jesting and
 conversing, until suddenly they went down like a log in the supreme
 convulsion. The severest wounds were hardly felt at the moment they were
 received; it was only at a later period that the terrible suffering
 commenced, venting itself in shrieks and hot tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, that accursed wood, that wood of slaughter and despair, where, amid
 the sobbing of the expiring trees, arose by degrees and swelled the
 agonized clamor of wounded men. Maurice and Jean saw a zouave, nearly
 disemboweled, propped against the trunk of an oak, who kept up a most
 terrific howling, without a moment's intermission. A little way beyond
 another man was actually being slowly roasted; his clothing had taken fire
 and the flames had run up and caught his beard, while he, paralyzed by a
 shot that had broken his back, was silently weeping scalding tears. Then
 there was a captain, who, one arm torn from its socket and his flank laid
 open to the thigh, was writhing on the ground in agony unspeakable,
 beseeching, in heartrending accents, the by-passers to end his suffering.
 There were others, and others, and others still, whose torments may not be
 described, strewing the grass-grown paths in such numbers that the utmost
 caution was required to avoid treading them under foot. But the dead and
 wounded had ceased to count; the comrade who fell by the way was abandoned
 to his fate, forgotten as if he had never been. No one turned to look
 behind. It was his destiny, poor devil! Next it would be someone else,
 themselves, perhaps.
 </p>
 <p>
 They were approaching the edge of the wood when a cry of distress was
 heard behind them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Help! help!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the subaltern standard-bearer, who had been shot through the left
 lung. He had fallen, the blood pouring in a stream from his mouth, and as
 no one heeded his appeal he collected his fast ebbing strength for another
 effort:
 </p>
 <p>
 "To the colors!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas turned and in a single bound was at his side. He took the flag, the
 staff of which had been broken in the fall, while the young officer
 murmured in words that were choked by the bubbling tide of blood and
 froth:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never mind me; I am a goner. Save the flag!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And they left him to himself in that charming woodland glade to writhe in
 protracted agony upon the ground, tearing up the grass with his stiffening
 fingers and praying for death, which would be hours yet ere it came to end
 his misery.
 </p>
 <p>
 At last they had left the wood and its horrors behind them. Beside Maurice
 and Jean all that were left of the little band were Lieutenant Rochas,
 Lapoulle and Pache. Gaude, who had strayed away from his companions,
 presently came running from a thicket to rejoin them, his bugle hanging
 from his neck and thumping against his back with every step he took. It
 was a great comfort to them all to find themselves once again in the open
 country, where they could draw their breath; and then, too, there were no
 longer any whistling bullets and crashing shells to harass them; the
 firing had ceased on this side of the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
 The first object they set eyes on was an officer who had reined in his
 smoking, steaming charger before a farm-yard gate and was venting his
 towering rage in a volley of Billingsgate. It was General
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles, the commander of their brigade, covered with dust
 and looking as if he was about to tumble from his horse with fatigue. The
 chagrin on his gross, high-colored, animal face told how deeply he took to
 heart the disaster that he regarded in the light of a personal misfortune.
 His command had seen nothing of him since morning. Doubtless he was
 somewhere on the battlefield, striving to rally the remnants of his
 brigade, for he was not the man to look closely to his own safety in his
 rage against those Prussian batteries that had at the same time destroyed
 the empire and the fortunes of a rising officer, the favorite of the
 Tuileries.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i>" he shouted, "is there no one of whom one can
 ask a question in this d&mdash;&mdash;-d country?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The farmer's people had apparently taken to the woods. At last a very old
 woman appeared at the door, some servant who had been forgotten, or whose
 feeble legs had compelled her to remain behind.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo, old lady, come here! Which way from here is Belgium?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She looked at him stupidly, as one who failed to catch his meaning. Then
 he lost all control of himself and effervesced, forgetful that the woman
 was only a poor peasant, bellowing that he had no idea of going back to
 Sedan to be caught like a rat in a trap; not he! he was going to make
 tracks for foreign parts, he was, and d&mdash;&mdash;-d quick, too! Some
 soldiers had come up and stood listening.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But you won't get through, General," spoke up a sergeant; "the Prussians
 are everywhere. This morning was the time for you to cut stick."
 </p>
 <p>
 There were stories even then in circulation of companies that had become
 separated from their regiments and crossed the frontier without any
 intention of doing so, and of others that, later in the day, had succeeded
 in breaking through the enemy's lines before the armies had effected their
 final junction.
 </p>
 <p>
 The general shrugged his shoulders impatiently. "What, with a few daring
 fellows of your stripe, do you mean to say we couldn't go where we please?
 I think I can find fifty daredevils to risk their skin in the attempt."
 Then, turning again to the old peasant: "<i>Eh!</i> you old mummy, answer,
 will you, in the devil's name! where is the frontier?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She understood him this time. She extended her skinny arm in the direction
 of the forest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That way, that way!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Eh? What's that you say? Those houses that we see down there, at the end
 of the field?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! farther, much farther. Down yonder, away down yonder!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The general seemed as if his anger must suffocate him. "It is too
 disgusting, an infernal country like this! one can make neither top nor
 tail of it. There was Belgium, right under our nose; we were all afraid we
 should put our foot in it without knowing it; and now that one wants to go
 there it is somewhere else. No, no! it is too much; I've had enough of it;
 let them take me prisoner if they will, let them do what they choose with
 me; I am going to bed!" And clapping spurs to his horse, bobbing up and
 down on his saddle like an inflated wine skin, he galloped off toward
 Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 A winding path conducted the party down into the Fond de Givonne, an
 outskirt of the city lying between two hills, where the single village
 street, running north and south and sloping gently upward toward the
 forest, was lined with gardens and modest houses. This street was just
 then so obstructed by flying soldiers that Lieutenant Rochas, with Pache,
 Lapoulle, and Gaude, found himself caught in the throng and unable for the
 moment to move in either direction. Maurice and Jean had some difficulty
 in rejoining them; and all were surprised to hear themselves hailed by a
 husky, drunken voice, proceeding from the tavern on the corner, near which
 they were blockaded.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My stars, if here ain't the gang! Hallo, boys, how are you? My stars, I'm
 glad to see you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They turned, and recognized Chouteau, leaning from a window of the ground
 floor of the inn. He seemed to be very drunk, and went on, interspersing
 his speech with hiccoughs:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, fellows, don't stand on ceremony if you're thirsty. There's enough
 left for the comrades." He turned unsteadily and called to someone who was
 invisible within the room: "Come here, you lazybones. Give these gentlemen
 something to drink&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet appeared in turn, advancing with a flourish and holding aloft in
 either hand a full bottle, which he waved above his head triumphantly. He
 was not so far gone as his companion; with his Parisian <i>blague</i>,
 imitating the nasal drawl of the coco-venders of the boulevards on a
 public holiday, he cried:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here you are, nice and cool, nice and cool! Who'll have a drink?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Nothing had been seen of the precious pair since they had vanished under
 pretense of taking Sergeant Sapin into the ambulance. It was sufficiently
 evident that since then they had been strolling and seeing the sights,
 taking care to keep out of the way of the shells, until finally they had
 brought up at this inn that was given over to pillage.
 </p>
 <p>
 Lieutenant Rochas was very angry. "Wait a bit, you scoundrels, just wait,
 and I'll attend to your case! deserting and getting drunk while the rest
 of your company were under fire!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Chouteau would have none of his reprimand. "See here, you old lunatic,
 I want you to understand that the grade of lieutenant is abolished; we are
 all free and equal now. Aren't you satisfied with the basting the
 Prussians gave you to-day, or do you want some more?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The others had to restrain the lieutenant to keep him from assaulting the
 socialist. Loubet himself, dandling his bottles affectionately in his
 arms, did what he could to pour oil upon the troubled waters.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Quit that, now! what's the use quarreling, when all men are brothers!"
 And catching sight of Lapoulle and Pache, his companions in the squad:
 "Don't stand there like great gawks, you fellows! Come in here and take
 something to wash the dust out of your throats."
 </p>
 <p>
 Lapoulle hesitated a moment, dimly conscious of the impropriety there was
 in the indulgence when so many poor devils were in such sore distress, but
 he was so knocked up with fatigue, so terribly hungry and thirsty! He said
 not a word, but suddenly making up his mind, gave one bound and landed in
 the room, pushing before him Pache, who, equally silent, yielded to the
 temptation he had not strength to resist. And they were seen no more.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The infernal scoundrels!" muttered Rochas. "They deserve to be shot,
 every mother's son of them!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had now remaining with him of his party only Jean, Maurice, and Gaude,
 and all four of them, notwithstanding their resistance, were gradually
 involved and swallowed up in the torrent of stragglers and fugitives that
 streamed along the road, filling its whole width from ditch to ditch. Soon
 they were at a distance from the inn. It was the routed army rolling down
 upon the ramparts of Sedan, a roily, roaring flood, such as the
 disintegrated mass of earth and boulders that the storm, scouring the
 mountainside, sweeps down into the valley. From all the surrounding
 plateaus, down every slope, up every narrow gorge, by the Floing road, by
 Pierremont, by the cemetery, by the Champ de Mars, as well as through the
 Fond de Givonne, the same sorry rabble was streaming cityward in panic
 haste, and every instant brought fresh accessions to its numbers. And who
 could reproach those wretched men, who, for twelve long, mortal hours, had
 stood in motionless array under the murderous artillery of an invisible
 enemy, against whom they could do nothing? The batteries now were playing
 on them from front, flank, and rear; as they drew nearer the city they
 presented a fairer mark for the convergent fire; the guns dealt death and
 destruction out by wholesale on that dense, struggling mass of men in that
 accursed hole, where there was no escape from the bursting shells. Some
 regiments of the 7th corps, more particularly those that had been
 stationed about Floing, had left the field in tolerably good order, but in
 the Fond de Givonne there was no longer either organization or command;
 the troops were a pushing, struggling mob, composed of debris from
 regiments of every description, zouaves, turcos, chasseurs, infantry of
 the line, most of them without arms, their uniforms soiled and torn, with
 grimy hands, blackened faces, bloodshot eyes starting from their sockets
 and lips swollen and distorted from their yells of fear or rage. At times
 a riderless horse would dash through the throng, overturning those who
 were in his path and leaving behind him a long wake of consternation. Then
 some guns went thundering by at breakneck speed, a retreating battery
 abandoned by its officers, and the drivers, as if drunk, rode down
 everything and everyone, giving no word of warning. And still the
 shuffling tramp of many feet along the dusty road went on and ceased not,
 the close-compacted column pressed on, breast to back, side to side; a
 retreat <i>en masse</i>, where vacancies in the ranks were filled as soon
 as made, all moved by one common impulse, to reach the shelter that lay
 before them and be behind a wall.
 </p>
 <p>
 Again Jean raised his head and gave an anxious glance toward the west;
 through the dense clouds of dust raised by the tramp of that great
 multitude the luminary still poured his scorching rays down upon the
 exhausted men. The sunset was magnificent, the heavens transparently,
 beautifully blue.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's a nuisance, all the same," he muttered, "that plaguey sun that stays
 up there and won't go to roost!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly Maurice became aware of the presence of a young woman whom the
 movement of the resistless throng had jammed against a wall and who was in
 danger of being injured, and on looking more attentively was astounded to
 recognize in her his sister Henriette. For near a minute he stood gazing
 at her in open-mouthed amazement, and finally it was she who spoke,
 without any appearance of surprise, as if she found the meeting entirely
 natural.
 </p>
 <p>
 "They shot him at Bazeilles&mdash;and I was there. Then, in the hope that
 they might at least let me have his body, I had an idea&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She did not mention either Weiss or the Prussians by name; it seemed to
 her that everyone must understand. Maurice did understand. It made his
 heart bleed; he gave a great sob.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor darling!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When, about two o'clock, Henriette recovered consciousness, she found
 herself at Balan, in the kitchen of some people who were strangers to her,
 her head resting on a table, weeping. Almost immediately, however, she
 dried her tears; already the heroic element was reasserting itself in that
 silent woman, so frail, so gentle, yet of a spirit so indomitable that she
 could suffer martyrdom for the faith, or the love, that was in her. She
 knew not fear; her quiet, undemonstrative courage was lofty and
 invincible. When her distress was deepest she had summoned up her
 resolution, devoting her reflections to how she might recover her
 husband's body, so as to give it decent burial. Her first project was
 neither more nor less than to make her way back to Bazeilles, but everyone
 advised her against this course, assuring her that it would be absolutely
 impossible to get through the German lines. She therefore abandoned the
 idea, and tried to think of someone among her acquaintance who would
 afford her the protection of his company, or at least assist her in the
 necessary preliminaries. The person to whom she determined she would apply
 was a M. Dubreuil, a cousin of hers, who had been assistant superintendent
 of the refinery at Chene at the time her husband was employed there; Weiss
 had been a favorite of his; he would not refuse her his assistance. Since
 the time, now two years ago, when his wife had inherited a handsome
 fortune, he had been occupying a pretty villa, called the Hermitage, the
 terraces of which could be seen skirting the hillside of a suburb of
 Sedan, on the further side of the Fond de Givonne. And thus it was toward
 the Hermitage that she was now bending her steps, compelled at every
 moment to pause before some fresh obstacle, continually menaced with being
 knocked down and trampled to death.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, to whom she briefly explained her project, gave it his approval.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Cousin Dubreuil has always been a good friend to us. He will be of
 service to you."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then an idea of another nature occurred to him. Lieutenant Rochas was
 greatly embarrassed as to what disposition he should make of the flag.
 They all were firmly resolved to save it&mdash;to do anything rather than
 allow it to fall into the hands of the Prussians. It had been suggested to
 cut it into pieces, of which each should carry one off under his shirt, or
 else to bury it at the foot of a tree, so noting the locality in memory
 that they might be able to come and disinter it at some future day; but
 the idea of mutilating the flag, or burying it like a corpse, affected
 them too painfully, and they were considering if they might not preserve
 it in some other manner. When Maurice, therefore, proposed to entrust the
 standard to a reliable person who would conceal it and, in case of
 necessity, defend it, until such day as he should restore it to them
 intact, they all gave their assent.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come," said the young man, addressing his sister, "we will go with you to
 the Hermitage and see if Dubreuil is there. Besides, I do not wish to
 leave you without protection."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was no easy matter to extricate themselves from the press, but they
 succeeded finally and entered a path that led upward on their left. They
 soon found themselves in a region intersected by a perfect labyrinth of
 lanes and narrow passages, a district where truck farms and gardens
 predominated, interspersed with an occasional villa and small holdings of
 extremely irregular outline, and these lanes and passages wound
 circuitously between blank walls, turning sharp corners at every few steps
 and bringing up abruptly in the cul-de-sac of some courtyard, affording
 admirable facilities for carrying on a guerilla warfare; there were spots
 where ten men might defend themselves for hours against a regiment.
 Desultory firing was already beginning to be heard, for the suburb
 commanded Balan, and the Bavarians were already coming up on the other
 side of the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice and Henriette, who were in the rear of the others, had turned
 once to the left, then to the right and then to the left again, following
 the course of two interminable walls, they suddenly came out before the
 Hermitage, the door of which stood wide open. The grounds, at the top of
 which was a small park, were terraced off in three broad terraces, on one
 of which stood the residence, a roomy, rectangular structure, approached
 by an avenue of venerable elms. Facing it, and separated from it by the
 deep, narrow valley, with its steeply sloping banks, were other similar
 country seats, backed by a wood.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette's anxiety was aroused at sight of the open door, "They are not
 at home," she said; "they must have gone away."
 </p>
 <p>
 The truth was that Dubreuil had decided the day before to take his wife
 and children to Bouillon, where they would be in safety from the disaster
 he felt was impending. And yet the house was not unoccupied; even at a
 distance and through the intervening trees the approaching party were
 conscious of movements going on within its walls. As the young woman
 advanced into the avenue she recoiled before the dead body of a Prussian
 soldier.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The devil!" exclaimed Rochas; "so they have already been exchanging
 civilities in this quarter!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then all hands, desiring to ascertain what was going on, hurried forward
 to the house, and there their curiosity was quickly gratified; the doors
 and windows of the <i>rez-de-chaussee</i> had been smashed in with
 musket-butts and the yawning apertures disclosed the destruction that the
 marauders had wrought in the rooms within, while on the graveled terrace
 lay various articles of furniture that had been hurled from the stoop.
 Particularly noticeable was a drawing-room suite in sky-blue satin, its
 sofa and twelve fauteuils piled in dire confusion, helter-skelter, on and
 around a great center table, the marble top of which was broken in twain.
 And there were zouaves, chasseurs, liners, and men of the infanterie de
 marine running to and fro excitedly behind the buildings and in the
 alleys, discharging their pieces into the little wood that faced them
 across the valley.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lieutenant," a zouave said to Rochas, by way of explanation, "we found a
 pack of those dirty Prussian hounds here, smashing things and raising Cain
 generally. We settled their hash for them, as you can see for yourself;
 only they will be coming back here presently, ten to our one, and that
 won't be so pleasant."
 </p>
 <p>
 Three other corpses of Prussian soldiers were stretched upon the terrace.
 As Henriette was looking at them absently, her thoughts doubtless far away
 with her husband, who, amid the blood and ashes of Bazeilles, was also
 sleeping his last sleep, a bullet whistled close to her head and struck a
 tree that stood behind her. Jean sprang forward.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Madame, don't stay there. Go inside the house, quick, quick!"
 </p>
 <p>
 His heart overflowed with pity as he beheld the change her terrible
 affliction had wrought in her, and he recalled her image as she had
 appeared to him only the day before, her face bright with the kindly smile
 of the happy, loving wife. At first he had found no word to say to her,
 hardly knowing even if she would recognize him. He felt that he could
 gladly give his life, if that would serve to restore her peace of mind.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go inside, and don't come out. At the first sign of danger we will come
 for you, and we will all escape together by way of the wood up yonder."
 </p>
 <p>
 But she apathetically replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, M. Jean, what is the use?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Her brother, however, was also urging her, and finally she ascended the
 stoop and took her position within the vestibule, whence her vision
 commanded a view of the avenue in its entire length. She was a spectator
 of the ensuing combat.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean had posted themselves behind one of the elms near the
 house. The gigantic trunks of the centenarian monarchs were amply
 sufficient to afford shelter to two men. A little way from them Gaude, the
 bugler, had joined forces with Lieutenant Rochas, who, unwilling to
 confide the flag to other hands, had rested it against the tree at his
 side while he handled his musket. And every trunk had its defenders; from
 end to end the avenue was lined with men covered, Indian fashion, by the
 trees, who only exposed their head when ready to fire.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the wood across the valley the Prussians appeared to be receiving
 re-enforcements, for their fire gradually grew warmer. There was no one to
 be seen; at most, the swiftly vanishing form now and then of a man
 changing his position. A villa, with green shutters, was occupied by their
 sharpshooters, who fired from the half-open windows of the <i>rez-de-chaussee</i>.
 It was about four o'clock, and the noise of the cannonade in the distance
 was diminishing, the guns were being silenced one by one; and there they
 were, French and Prussians, in that out-of-the-way-corner whence they
 could not see the white flag floating over the citadel, still engaged in
 the work of mutual slaughter, as if their quarrel had been a personal one.
 Notwithstanding the armistice there were many such points where the battle
 continued to rage until it was too dark to see; the rattle of musketry was
 heard in the faubourg of the Fond de Givonne and in the gardens of
 Petit-Pont long after it had ceased elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
 For a quarter of an hour the bullets flew thick and fast from one side of
 the valley to the other. Now and again someone who was so incautious as to
 expose himself went down with a ball in his head or chest. There were
 three men lying dead in the avenue. The rattling in the throat of another
 man who had fallen prone upon his face was something horrible to listen
 to, and no one thought to go and turn him on his back to ease his dying
 agony. Jean, who happened to look around just at that moment, beheld
 Henriette glide tranquilly down the steps, approach the wounded man and
 turn him over, then slip a knapsack beneath his head by way of pillow. He
 ran and seized her and forcibly brought her back behind the tree where he
 and Maurice were posted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you wish to be killed?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She appeared to be entirely unconscious of the danger to which she had
 exposed herself.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, no&mdash;but I am afraid to remain in that house, all alone. I would
 rather be outside."
 </p>
 <p>
 And so she stayed with them. They seated her on the ground at their feet,
 against the trunk of the tree, and went on expending the few cartridges
 that were left them, blazing away to right and left, with such fury that
 they quite forgot their sensations of fear and fatigue. They were utterly
 unconscious of what was going on around them, acting mechanically, with
 but one end in view; even the instinct of self-preservation had deserted
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look, Maurice," suddenly said Henriette; "that dead soldier there before
 us, does he not belong to the Prussian Guard?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had been eying attentively for the past minute or two one of the dead
 bodies that the enemy had left behind them when they retreated, a short,
 thick-set young man, with big mustaches, lying upon his side on the gravel
 of the terrace.
 </p>
 <p>
 The chin-strap had broken, releasing the spiked helmet, which had rolled
 away a few steps. And it was indisputable that the body was attired in the
 uniform of the Guard; the dark gray trousers, the blue tunic with white
 facings, the greatcoat rolled and worn, belt-wise, across the shoulder.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is the Guard uniform," she said; "I am quite certain of it. It is
 exactly like the colored plate I have at home, and then the photograph
 that Cousin Gunther sent us&mdash;" She stopped suddenly, and with her
 unconcerned, fearless air, before anyone could make a motion to detain
 her, walked up to the corpse, bent down and read the number of the
 regiment. "Ah, the Forty-third!" she exclaimed. "I knew it."
 </p>
 <p>
 And she returned to her position, while a storm of bullets whistled around
 her ears. "Yes, the Forty-third; Cousin Gunther's regiment&mdash;something
 told me it must be so. Ah! if my poor husband were only here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 After that all Jean's and Maurice's entreaties were ineffectual to make
 her keep quiet. She was feverishly restless, constantly protruding her
 head to peer into the opposite wood, evidently harassed by some anxiety
 that preyed upon her mind. Her companions continued to load and fire with
 the same blind fury, pushing her back with their knee whenever she exposed
 herself too rashly. It looked as if the Prussians were beginning to
 consider that their numbers would warrant them in attacking, for they
 showed themselves more frequently and there were evidences of preparations
 going on behind the trees. They were suffering severely, however, from the
 fire of the French, whose bullets at that short range rarely failed to
 bring down their man.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That may be your cousin," said Jean. "Look, that officer over there, who
 has just come out of the house with the green shutters."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was a captain, as could be seen by the gold braid on the collar of his
 tunic and the golden eagle on his helmet that flashed back the level ray
 of the setting sun. He had discarded his epaulettes, and carrying his
 saber in his right hand, was shouting an order in a sharp, imperative
 voice; and the distance between them was so small, a scant two hundred
 yards, that every detail of his trim, slender figure was plainly
 discernible, as well as the pinkish, stern face and slight blond mustache.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette scrutinized him with attentive eyes. "It is he," she replied,
 apparently unsurprised. "I recognize him perfectly."
 </p>
 <p>
 With a look of concentrated rage Maurice drew his piece to his shoulder
 and covered him. "The cousin&mdash;Ah! sure as there is a God in heaven he
 shall pay for Weiss."
 </p>
 <p>
 But, quivering with excitement, she jumped to her feet and knocked up the
 weapon, whose charge was wasted on the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Stop, stop! we must not kill acquaintances, relatives! It is too
 barbarous."
 </p>
 <p>
 And, all her womanly instincts coming back to her, she sank down behind
 the tree and gave way to a fit of violent weeping. The horror of it all
 was too much for her; in her great dread and sorrow she was forgetful of
 all beside.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas, meantime, was in his element. He had excited the few zouaves and
 other troops around him to such a pitch of frenzy, their fire had become
 so murderously effective at sight of the Prussians, that the latter first
 wavered and then retreated to the shelter of their wood.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Stand your ground, my boys! don't give way an inch! Aha, see 'em run, the
 cowards! we'll fix their flint for 'em!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He was in high spirits and seemed to have recovered all his unbounded
 confidence, certain that victory was yet to crown their efforts. There had
 been no defeat. The handful of men before him stood in his eyes for the
 united armies of Germany, and he was going to destroy them at his leisure.
 All his long, lean form, all his thin, bony face, where the huge nose
 curved down upon the self-willed, sensual mouth, exhaled a laughing,
 vain-glorious satisfaction, the joy of the conquering trooper who goes
 through the world with his sweetheart on his arm and a bottle of good wine
 in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Parbleu</i>, my children, what are we here for, I'd like to know, if
 not to lick 'em out of their boots? and that's the way this affair is
 going to end, just mark my words. We shouldn't know ourselves any longer
 if we should let ourselves be beaten. Beaten! come, come, that is too
 good! When the neighbors tread on our toes, or when we feel we are
 beginning to grow rusty for want of something to do, we just turn to and
 give 'em a thrashing; that's all there is to it. Come, boys, let 'em have
 it once more, and you'll see 'em run like so many jackrabbits!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He bellowed and gesticulated like a lunatic, and was such a good fellow
 withal in the comforting illusion of his ignorance that the men were
 inoculated with his confidence. He suddenly broke out again:
 </p>
 <p>
 "And we'll kick 'em, we'll kick 'em, we'll kick 'em to the frontier!
 Victory, victory!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But at that juncture, just as the enemy across the valley seemed really to
 be falling back, a hot fire of musketry came pouring in on them from the
 left. It was a repetition of the everlasting flanking movement that had
 done the Prussians such good service; a strong detachment of the Guards
 had crept around toward the French rear through the Fond de Givonne. It
 was useless to think of holding the position longer; the little band of
 men who were defending the terraces were caught between two fires and
 menaced with being cut off from Sedan. Men fell on every side, and for a
 moment the confusion was extreme; the Prussians were already scaling the
 wall of the park, and advancing along the pathways. Some zouaves rushed
 forward to repel them, and there was a fierce hand-to-hand struggle with
 the bayonet. There was one zouave, a big, handsome, brown-bearded man,
 bare-headed and with his jacket hanging in tatters from his shoulders, who
 did his work with appalling thoroughness, driving his reeking bayonet home
 through splintering bones and yielding tissues, cleansing it of the gore
 that it had contracted from one man by plunging it into the flesh of
 another; and when it broke he laid about him, smashing many a skull, with
 the butt of his musket; and when finally he made a misstep and lost his
 weapon he sprung, bare-handed, for the throat of a burly Prussian, with
 such tigerish fierceness that both men rolled over and over on the gravel
 to the shattered kitchen door, clasped in a mortal embrace. The trees of
 the park looked down on many such scenes of slaughter, and the green lawn
 was piled with corpses. But it was before the stoop, around the sky-blue
 sofa and fauteuils, that the conflict raged with greatest fury; a maddened
 mob of savages, firing at one another at point-blank range, so that hair
 and beards were set on fire, tearing one another with teeth and nails when
 a knife was wanting to slash the adversary's throat.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Gaude, with his sorrowful face, the face of a man who has had his
 troubles of which he does not care to speak, was seized with a sort of
 sudden heroic madness. At that moment of irretrievable defeat, when he
 must have known that the company was annihilated and that there was not a
 man left to answer his summons, he grasped his bugle, carried it to his
 lips and sounded the general, in so tempestuous, ear-splitting strains
 that one would have said he wished to wake the dead. Nearer and nearer
 came the Prussians, but he never stirred, only sounding the call the
 louder, with all the strength of his lungs. He fell, pierced with many
 bullets, and his spirit passed in one long-drawn, parting wail that died
 away and was lost upon the shuddering air.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rochas made no attempt to fly; he seemed unable to comprehend. Even more
 erect than usual, he waited the end, stammering:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, what's the matter? what's the matter?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Such a possibility had never entered his head as that they could be
 defeated. They were changing everything in these degenerate days, even to
 the manner of fighting; had not those fellows a right to remain on their
 own side of the valley and wait for the French to go and attack them?
 There was no use killing them; as fast as they were killed more kept
 popping up. What kind of a d&mdash;&mdash;-d war was it, anyway, where
 they were able to collect ten men against their opponent's one, where they
 never showed their face until evening, after blazing away at you all day
 with their artillery until you didn't know on which end you were standing?
 Aghast and confounded, having failed so far to acquire the first idea of
 the rationale of the campaign, he was dimly conscious of the existence of
 some mysterious, superior method which he could not comprehend, against
 which he ceased to struggle, although in his dogged stubbornness he kept
 repeating mechanically:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Courage, my children! victory is before us!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Meanwhile he had stooped and clutched the flag. That was his last, his
 only thought, to save the flag, retreating again, if necessary, so that it
 might not be defiled by contact with Prussian hands. But the staff,
 although it was broken, became entangled in his legs; he narrowly escaped
 falling. The bullets whistled past him, he felt that death was near; he
 stripped the silk from the staff and tore it into shreds, striving to
 destroy it utterly. And then it was that, stricken at once in the neck,
 chest, and legs, he sank to earth amid the bright tri-colored rags, as if
 they had been his pall. He survived a moment yet, gazing before him with
 fixed, dilated eyes, reading, perhaps, in the vision he beheld on the
 horizon the stern lesson that War conveys, the cruel, vital struggle that
 is to be accepted not otherwise than gravely, reverently, as immutable
 law. Then a slight tremor ran through his frame, and darkness succeeded to
 his infantine bewilderment; he passed away, like some poor dumb, lowly
 creature of a day, a joyous insect that mighty, impassive Nature, in her
 relentless fatality, has caught and crushed. In him died all a legend.
 </p>
 <p>
 When the Prussians began to draw near Jean and Maurice had retreated,
 retiring from tree to tree, face to the enemy, and always, as far as
 possible, keeping Henriette behind them. They did not give over firing,
 discharging their pieces and then falling back to seek a fresh cover.
 Maurice knew where there was a little wicket in the wall at the upper part
 of the park, and they were so fortunate as to find it unfastened. With
 lighter hearts when they had left it behind them, they found themselves in
 a narrow by-road that wound between two high walls, but after following it
 for some distance the sound of firing in front caused them to turn into a
 path on their left. As luck would have it, it ended in an <i>impasse</i>;
 they had to retrace their steps, running the gauntlet of the bullets, and
 take the turning to the right. When they came to exchange reminiscences in
 later days they could never agree on which road they had taken. In that
 tangled network of suburban lanes and passages there was firing still
 going on from every corner that afforded a shelter, protracted battles
 raged at the gates of farmyards, everything that could be converted into a
 barricade had its defenders, from whom the assailants tried to wrest it;
 all with the utmost fury and vindictiveness. And all at once they came out
 upon the Fond de Givonne road, not far from Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 For the third time Jean raised his eyes toward the western sky, that was
 all aflame with a bright, rosy light; and he heaved a sigh of unspeakable
 relief.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, that pig of a sun! at last he is going to bed!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And they ran with might and main, all three of them, never once stopping
 to draw breath. About them, filling the road in all its breadth, was the
 rear-guard of fugitives from the battlefield, still flowing onward with
 the irresistible momentum of an unchained mountain torrent. When they came
 to the Balan gate they had a long period of waiting in the midst of the
 impatient, ungovernable throng. The chains of the drawbridge had given
 way, and the only path across the fosse was by the foot-bridge, so that
 the guns and horses had to turn back and seek admission by the bridge of
 the chateau, where the jam was said to be even still more fearful. At the
 gate of la Cassine, too, people were trampled to death in their eagerness
 to gain admittance. From all the adjacent heights the terror-stricken
 fragments of the army came tumbling into the city, as into a cesspool,
 with the hollow roar of pent-up water that has burst its dam. The fatal
 attraction of those walls had ended by making cowards of the bravest; men
 trod one another down in their blind haste to be under cover.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice had caught Henriette in his arms, and in a voice that trembled
 with suspense:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It cannot be," he said, "that they will have the cruelty to close the
 gate and shut us out."
 </p>
 <p>
 That was what the crowd feared would be done. To right and left, however,
 upon the glacis soldiers were already arranging their bivouacs, while
 entire batteries, guns, caissons, and horses, in confusion worse
 confounded, had thrown themselves pell-mell into the fosse for safety.
 </p>
 <p>
 But now shrill, impatient bugle calls rose on the evening air, followed
 soon by the long-drawn strains of retreat. They were summoning the belated
 soldiers back to their comrades, who came running in, singly and in
 groups. A dropping fire of musketry still continued in the faubourgs, but
 it was gradually dying out. Heavy guards were stationed on the banquette
 behind the parapet to protect the approaches, and at last the gate was
 closed. The Prussians were within a hundred yards of the sally-port; they
 could be seen moving on the Balan road, tranquilly establishing themselves
 in the houses and gardens.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean, pushing Henriette before them to protect her from the
 jostling of the throng, were among the last to enter Sedan. Six o'clock
 was striking. The artillery fire had ceased nearly an hour ago. Soon the
 distant musketry fire, too, was silenced. Then, to the deafening uproar,
 to the vengeful thunder that had been roaring since morning, there
 succeeded a stillness as of death. Night came, and with it came a boding
 silence, fraught with terror.
 </p>

 VIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 At half-past five o'clock, after the closing of the gates, Delaherche, in
 his eager thirst for news, now that he knew the battle lost, had again
 returned to the Sous-Prefecture. He hung persistently about the approaches
 of the janitor's lodge, tramping up and down the paved courtyard with
 feverish impatience, for more than three hours, watching for every officer
 who came up and interviewing him, and thus it was that he had become
 acquainted, piecemeal, with the rapid series of events; how General de
 Wimpffen had tendered his resignation and then withdrawn it upon the
 peremptory refusal of Generals Ducrot and Douay to append their names to
 the articles of capitulation, how the Emperor had thereupon invested the
 General with full authority to proceed to the Prussian headquarters and
 treat for the surrender of the vanquished army on the most advantageous
 terms obtainable; how, finally, a council of war had been convened with
 the object of deciding what possibilities there were of further
 protracting the struggle successfully by the defense of the fortress.
 During the deliberations of this council, which consisted of some twenty
 officers of the highest rank and seemed to him as if it would never end,
 the cloth manufacturer climbed the steps of the huge public building at
 least twenty times, and at last his curiosity was gratified by beholding
 General de Wimpffen emerge, very red in the face and his eyelids puffed
 and swollen with tears, behind whom came two other generals and a colonel.
 They leaped into the saddle and rode away over the Pont de Meuse. The
 bells had struck eight some time before; the inevitable capitulation was
 now to be accomplished, from which there was no escape.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche, somewhat relieved in mind by what he had heard and seen,
 remembered that it was a long time since he had tasted food and resolved
 to turn his steps homeward, but the terrific crowd that had collected
 since he first came made him pause in dismay. It is no exaggeration to say
 that the streets and squares were so congested, so thronged, so densely
 packed with horses, men, and guns, that one would have declared the
 closely compacted mass could only have been squeezed and wedged in there
 thus by the effort of some gigantic mechanism. While the ramparts were
 occupied by the bivouacs of such regiments as had fallen back in good
 order, the city had been invaded and submerged by an angry, surging,
 desperate flood, the broken remnants of the various corps, stragglers and
 fugitives from all arms of the service, and the dammed-up tide made it
 impossible for one to stir foot or hand. The wheels of the guns, of the
 caissons, and the innumerable vehicles of every description, had
 interlocked and were tangled in confusion worse confounded, while the poor
 horses, flogged unmercifully by their drivers and pulled, now in this
 direction, now in that, could only dance in their bewilderment, unable to
 move a step either forward or back. And the men, deaf to reproaches and
 threats alike, forced their way into the houses, devoured whatever they
 could lay hands on, flung themselves down to sleep wherever they could
 find a vacant space, it might be in the best bedroom or in the cellar.
 Many of them had fallen in doorways, where they blocked the vestibule;
 others, without strength to go farther, lay extended on the sidewalks and
 slept the sleep of death, not even rising when some by-passer trod on them
 and bruised an arm or leg, preferring the risk of death to the fatigue of
 changing their location.
 </p>
 <p>
 These things all helped to make Delaherche still more keenly conscious of
 the necessity of immediate capitulation. There were some quarters in which
 numerous caissons were packed so close together that they were in contact,
 and a single Prussian shell alighting on one of them must inevitably have
 exploded them all, entailing the immediate destruction of the city by
 conflagration. Then, too, what could be accomplished with such an
 assemblage of miserable wretches, deprived of all their powers, mental and
 physical, by reason of their long-endured privations, and destitute of
 either ammunition or subsistence? Merely to clear the streets and reduce
 them to a condition of something like order would require a whole day. The
 place was entirely incapable of defense, having neither guns nor
 provisions.
 </p>
 <p>
 These were the considerations that had prevailed at the council among
 those more reasonable officers who, in the midst of their grief and sorrow
 for their country and the army, had retained a clear and undistorted view
 of the situation as it was; and the more hot-headed among them, those who
 cried with emotion that it was impossible for an army to surrender thus,
 had been compelled to bow their head upon their breast in silence and
 admit that they had no practicable scheme to offer whereby the conflict
 might be recommenced on the morrow.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the Place Turenne and Place du Rivage, Delaherche succeeded with the
 greatest difficulty in working his way through the press. As he passed the
 Hotel of the Golden Cross a sorrowful vision greeted his eyes, that of the
 generals seated in the dining room, gloomily silent, around the empty
 board; there was nothing left to eat in the house, not even bread. General
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles, however, who had been storming and vociferating in
 the kitchen, appeared to have found something, for he suddenly held his
 peace and ran away swiftly up the stairs, holding in his hands a large
 paper parcel of a greasy aspect. Such was the crowd assembled there, to
 stare through the lighted windows upon the guests assembled around that
 famine-stricken <i>table d'hote</i>, that the manufacturer was obliged to
 make vigorous play with his elbows, and was frequently driven back by some
 wild rush of the mob and lost all the distance, and more, that he had just
 gained. In the Grande Rue, however, the obstacles became actually
 impassable, and there was a moment when he was inclined to give up in
 despair; a complete battery seemed to have been driven in there and the
 guns and <i>materiel</i> piled, pell-mell, on top of one another. Deciding
 finally to take the bull by the horns, he leaped to the axle of a piece
 and so pursued his way, jumping from wheel to wheel, straddling the guns,
 at the imminent risk of breaking his legs, if not his neck. Afterward it
 was some horses that blocked his way, and he made himself lowly and
 stooped, creeping among the feet and underneath the bellies of the sorry
 jades, who were ready to die of inanition, like their masters. Then, when
 after a quarter of an hour's laborious effort he reached the junction of
 the Rue Saint-Michel, he was terrified at the prospect of the dangers and
 obstacles that he had still to face, and which, instead of diminishing,
 seemed to be increasing, and made up his mind to turn down the street
 above mentioned, which would take him into the Rue des Laboureurs; he
 hoped that by taking these usually quiet and deserted passages he should
 escape the crowd and reach his home in safety. As luck would have it he
 almost directly came upon a house of ill-fame to which a band of drunken
 soldiers were in process of laying siege, and considering that a stray
 shot, should one reach him in the fracas, would be equally as unpleasant
 as one intended for him, he made haste to retrace his steps. Resolving to
 have done with it he pushed on to the end of the Grande Rue, now gaining a
 few feet by balancing himself, rope-walker fashion, along the pole of some
 vehicle, now climbing over an army wagon that barred his way. At the Place
 du College he was carried along&mdash;bodily on the shoulders of the
 throng for a space of thirty paces; he fell to the ground, narrowly
 escaped a set of fractured ribs, and saved himself only by the proximity
 of a friendly iron railing, by the bars of which he pulled himself to his
 feet. And when at last he reached the Rue Maqua, inundated with
 perspiration, his clothing almost torn from his back, he found that he had
 been more than an hour in coming from the Sous-Prefecture, a distance
 which in ordinary times he was accustomed to accomplish in less than five
 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Major Bouroche, with the intention of keeping the ambulance and garden
 from being overrun with intruders, had caused two sentries to be mounted
 at the door. This measure was a source of great comfort to Delaherche, who
 had begun to contemplate the possibilities of his house being subjected to
 pillage. The sight of the ambulance in the garden, dimly lighted by a few
 candles and exhaling its fetid, feverish emanations, caused him a fresh
 constriction of the heart; then, stumbling over the body of a soldier who
 was stretched in slumber on the stone pavement of the walk, he supposed
 him to be one of the fugitives who had managed to find his way in there
 from outside, until, calling to mind the 7th corps treasure that had been
 deposited there and the sentry who had been set over it, he saw how
 matters stood: the poor fellow, stationed there since early morning, had
 been overlooked by his superiors and had succumbed to his fatigue.
 Besides, the house seemed quite deserted; the ground floor was black as
 Egypt, and the doors stood wide open. The servants were doubtless all at
 the ambulance, for there was no one in the kitchen, which was faintly
 illuminated by the light of a wretched little smoky lamp. He lit a candle
 and ascended the main staircase very softly, in order not to awaken his
 wife and mother, whom he had begged to go to bed early after a day where
 the stress, both mental and physical, had been so intense.
 </p>
 <p>
 On entering his study, however, he beheld a sight that caused his eyes to
 dilate with astonishment. Upon the sofa on which Captain Beaudoin had
 snatched a few hours' repose the day before a soldier lay outstretched;
 and he could not understand the reason of it until he had looked and
 recognized young Maurice Levasseur, Henriette's brother. He was still more
 surprised when, on turning his head, he perceived, stretched on the floor
 and wrapped in a bed quilt, another soldier, that Jean, whom he had seen
 for a moment just before the battle. It was plain that the poor fellows,
 in their distress and fatigue after the conflict, not knowing where else
 to bestow themselves, had sought refuge there; they were crushed,
 annihilated, like dead men. He did not linger there, but pushed on to his
 wife's chamber, which was the next room on the corridor. A lamp was
 burning on a table in a corner; the profound silence seemed to shudder.
 Gilberte had thrown herself crosswise on the bed, fully dressed, doubtless
 in order to be prepared for any catastrophe, and was sleeping peacefully,
 while, seated on a chair at her side with her head declined and resting
 lightly on the very edge of the mattress, Henriette was also slumbering,
 with a fitful, agitated sleep, while big tears welled up beneath her
 swollen eyelids. He contemplated them silently for a moment, strongly
 tempted to awake and question the young woman in order to ascertain what
 she knew. Had she succeeded in reaching Bazeilles? and why was it that she
 was back there? Perhaps she would be able to give him some tidings of his
 dyehouse were he to ask her? A feeling of compassion stayed him, however,
 and he was about to leave the room when his mother, ghost-like, appeared
 at the threshold of the open door and beckoned him to follow her.
 </p>
 <p>
 As they were passing through the dining room he expressed his surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, have you not been abed to-night?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She shook her head, then said below her breath:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I cannot sleep; I have been sitting in an easy-chair beside the colonel.
 He is very feverish; he awakes at every instant, almost, and then plies me
 with questions. I don't know how to answer them. Come in and see him,
 you."
 </p>
 <p>
 M. de Vineuil had fallen asleep again. His long face, now brightly red,
 barred by the sweeping mustache that fell across it like a snowy
 avalanche, was scarce distinguishable on the pillow. Mme. Delaherche had
 placed a newspaper before the lamp and that corner of the room was lost in
 semi-darkness, while all the intensity of the bright lamplight was
 concentrated on her where she sat, uncompromisingly erect, in her
 fauteuil, her hands crossed before her in her lap, her vague eyes bent on
 space, in sorrowful reverie.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I think he must have heard you," she murmured; "he is awaking again."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was so; the colonel, without moving his head, had reopened his eyes and
 bent them on Delaherche. He recognized him, and immediately asked in a
 voice that his exhausted condition made tremulous:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is all over, is it not? We have capitulated."
 </p>
 <p>
 The manufacturer, who encountered the look his mother cast on him at that
 moment, was on the point of equivocating. But what good would it do? A
 look of discouragement passed across his face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What else remained to do? A single glance at the streets of the city
 would convince you. General de Wimpffen has just set out for Prussian
 general headquarters to discuss conditions."
 </p>
 <p>
 M. de Vineuil's eyes closed again, his long frame was shaken with a
 protracted shiver of supremely bitter grief, and this deep, long-drawn
 moan escaped his lips:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! merciful God, merciful God!" And without opening his eyes he went on
 in faltering, broken accents: "Ah! the plan I spoke of yesterday&mdash;they
 should have adopted it. Yes, I knew the country; I spoke of my
 apprehensions to the general, but even him they would not listen to.
 Occupy all the heights up there to the north, from Saint-Menges to
 Fleigneux, with your army looking down on and commanding Sedan, able at
 any time to move on Vrigne-aux-Bois, mistress of Saint-Albert's pass&mdash;and
 there we are; our positions are impregnable, the Mezieres road is under
 our control&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 His speech became more confused as he proceeded; he stammered a few more
 unintelligible words, while the vision of the battle that had been born of
 his fever little by little grew blurred and dim and at last was effaced by
 slumber. He slept, and in his sleep perhaps the honest officer's dreams
 were dreams of victory.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Does the major speak favorably of his case?" Delaherche inquired in a
 whisper.
 </p>
 <p>
 Madame Delaherche nodded affirmatively.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Those wounds in the foot are dreadful things, though," he went on. "I
 suppose he is likely to be laid up for a long time, isn't he?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She made him no answer this time, as if all her being, all her faculties
 were concentrated on contemplating the great calamity of their defeat. She
 was of another age; she was a survivor of that strong old race of frontier
 burghers who defended their towns so valiantly in the good days gone by.
 The clean-cut lines of her stern, set face, with its fleshless,
 uncompromising nose and thin lips, which the brilliant light of the lamp
 brought out in high relief against the darkness of the room, told the full
 extent of her stifled rage and grief and the wound sustained by her
 antique patriotism, the revolt of which refused even to let her sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
 About that time Delaherche became conscious of a sensation of isolation,
 accompanied by a most uncomfortable feeling of physical distress. His
 hunger was asserting itself again, a griping, intolerable hunger, and he
 persuaded himself that it was debility alone that was thus robbing him of
 courage and resolution. He tiptoed softly from the room and, with his
 candle, again made his way down to the kitchen, but the spectacle he
 witnessed there was even still more cheerless; the range cold and
 fireless, the closets empty, the floor strewn with a disorderly litter of
 towels, napkins, dish-clouts and women's aprons; as if the hurricane of
 disaster had swept through that place as well, bearing away on its wings
 all the charm and cheer that appertain naturally to the things we eat and
 drink. At first he thought he was not going to discover so much as a
 crust, what was left over of the bread having all found its way to the
 ambulance in the form of soup. At last, however, in the dark corner of a
 cupboard he came across the remainder of the beans from yesterday's
 dinner, where they had been forgotten, and ate them. He accomplished his
 luxurious repast without the formality of sitting down, without the
 accompaniment of salt and butter, for which he did not care to trouble
 himself to ascend to the floor above, desirous only to get away as
 speedily as possible from that dismal kitchen, where the blinking, smoking
 little lamp perfumed the air with fumes of petroleum.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not much more than ten o'clock, and Delaherche had no other
 occupation than to speculate on the various probabilities connected with
 the signing of the capitulation. A persistent apprehension haunted him; a
 dread lest the conflict might be renewed, and the horrible thought of what
 the consequences must be in such an event, of which he could not speak,
 but which rested on his bosom like an incubus. When he had reascended to
 his study, where he found Maurice and Jean in exactly the same position he
 had left them in, it was all in vain that he settled himself comfortably
 in his favorite easy-chair; sleep would not come to him; just as he was on
 the point of losing himself the crash of a shell would arouse him with a
 great start. It was the frightful cannonade of the day, the echoes of
 which were still ringing in his ears; and he would listen breathlessly for
 a moment, then sit and shudder at the equally appalling silence by which
 he was now surrounded. As he could not sleep he preferred to move about;
 he wandered aimlessly among the rooms, taking care to avoid that in which
 his mother was sitting by the colonel's bedside, for the steady gaze with
 which she watched him as he tramped nervously up and down had finally had
 the effect of disconcerting him. Twice he returned to see if Henriette had
 not awakened, and he paused an instant to glance at his wife's pretty
 face, so calmly peaceful, on which seemed to be flitting something like
 the faint shadow of a smile. Then, knowing not what to do, he went
 downstairs again, came back, moved about from room to room, until it was
 nearly two in the morning, wearying his ears with trying to decipher some
 meaning in the sounds that came to him from without.
 </p>
 <p>
 This condition of affairs could not last. Delaherche resolved to return
 once more to the Sous-Prefecture, feeling assured that all rest would be
 quite out of the question for him so long as his ignorance continued. A
 feeling of despair seized him, however, when he went downstairs and looked
 out upon the densely crowded street, where the confusion seemed to be
 worse than ever; never would he have the strength to fight his way to the
 Place Turenne and back again through obstacles the mere memory of which
 caused every bone in his body to ache again. And he was mentally
 discussing matters, when who should come up but Major Bouroche, panting,
 perspiring, and swearing.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> I wonder if my head's on my shoulders or not!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had been obliged to visit the Hotel de Ville to see the mayor about his
 supply of chloroform, and urge him to issue a requisition for a quantity,
 for he had many operations to perform, his stock of the drug was
 exhausted, and he was afraid, he said, that he should be compelled to
 carve up the poor devils without putting them to sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well?" inquired Delaherche.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, they can't even tell whether the apothecaries have any or not!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the manufacturer was thinking of other things than chloroform. "No,
 no," he continued. "Have they brought matters to a conclusion yet? Have
 they signed the agreement with the Prussians?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The major made a gesture of impatience. "There is nothing concluded," he
 cried. "It appears that those scoundrels are making demands out of all
 reason. Ah, well; let 'em commence afresh, then, and we'll all leave our
 bones here. That will be best!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche's face grew very pale as he listened. "But are you quite sure
 these things are so?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "I was told them by those fellows of the municipal council, who are in
 permanent session at the city hall. An officer had been dispatched from
 the Sous-Prefecture to lay the whole affair before them."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went on to furnish additional details. The interview had taken
 place at the Chateau de Bellevue, near Donchery, and the participants were
 General de Wimpffen, General von Moltke, and Bismarck. A stern and
 inflexible man was that von Moltke, a terrible man to deal with! He began
 by demonstrating that he was perfectly acquainted with the hopeless
 situation of the French army; it was destitute of ammunition and
 subsistence, demoralization and disorder pervaded its ranks, it was
 utterly powerless to break the iron circle by which it was girt about;
 while on the other hand the German armies occupied commanding positions
 from which they could lay the city in ashes in two hours. Coldly,
 unimpassionedly, he stated his terms: the entire French army to surrender
 arms and baggage and be treated as prisoners of war. Bismarck took no part
 in the discussion beyond giving the general his support, occasionally
 showing his teeth, like a big mastiff, inclined to be pacific on the
 whole, but quite ready to rend and tear should there be occasion for it.
 General de Wimpffen in reply protested with all the force he had at his
 command against these conditions, the most severe that ever were imposed
 on a vanquished army. He spoke of his personal grief and ill-fortune, the
 bravery of the troops, the danger there was in driving a proud nation to
 extremity; for three hours he spoke with all the energy and eloquence of
 despair, alternately threatening and entreating, demanding that they
 should content themselves with interning their prisoners in France, or
 even in Algeria; and in the end the only concession granted was, that the
 officers might retain their swords, and those among them who should enter
 into a solemn arrangement, attested by a written parole, to serve no more
 during the war, might return to their homes. Finally, the armistice to be
 prolonged until the next morning at ten o'clock; if at that time the terms
 had not been accepted, the Prussian batteries would reopen fire and the
 city would be burned.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's stupid!" exclaimed Delaherche; "they have no right to burn a city
 that has done nothing to deserve it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The major gave him still further food for anxiety by adding that some
 officers whom he had met at the Hotel de l'Europe were talking of making a
 sortie <i>en masse</i> just before daylight. An extremely excited state of
 feeling had prevailed since the tenor of the German demands had become
 known, and measures the most extravagant were proposed and discussed. No
 one seemed to be deterred by the consideration that it would be
 dishonorable to break the truce, taking advantage of the darkness and
 giving the enemy no notification, and the wildest, most visionary schemes
 were offered; they would resume the march on Carignan, hewing their way
 through the Bavarians, which they could do in the black night; they would
 recapture the plateau of Illy by a surprise; they would raise the blockade
 of the Mezieres road, or, by a determined, simultaneous rush, would force
 the German lines and throw themselves into Belgium. Others there were,
 indeed, who, feeling the hopelessness of their position, said nothing;
 they would have accepted any terms, signed any paper, with a glad cry of
 relief, simply to have the affair ended and done with.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-night!" Bouroche said in conclusion. "I am going to try to sleep a
 couple of hours; I need it badly."
 </p>
 <p>
 When left by himself Delaherche could hardly breathe. What, could it be
 true that they were going to fight again, were going to burn and raze
 Sedan! It was certainly to be, soon as the morrow's sun should be high
 enough upon the hills to light the horror of the sacrifice. And once again
 he almost unconsciously climbed the steep ladder that led to the roofs and
 found himself standing among the chimneys, at the edge of the narrow
 terrace that overlooked the city; but at that hour of the night the
 darkness was intense and he could distinguish absolutely nothing amid the
 swirling waves of the Cimmerian sea that lay beneath him. Then the
 buildings of the factory below were the first objects which, one by one,
 disentangled themselves from the shadows and stood out before his vision
 in indistinct masses, which he had no difficulty in recognizing: the
 engine-house, the shops, the drying rooms, the storehouses, and when he
 reflected that within twenty-four hours there would remain of that
 imposing block of buildings, his fortune and his pride, naught save
 charred timbers and crumbling walls, he overflowed with pity for himself.
 He raised his glance thence once more to the horizon, and sent it
 traveling in a circuit around that profound, mysterious veil of blackness
 behind which lay slumbering the menace of the morrow. To the south, in the
 direction of Bazeilles, a few quivering little flames that rose fitfully
 on the air told where had been the site of the unhappy village, while
 toward the north the farmhouse in the wood of la Garenne, that had been
 fired late in the afternoon, was burning still, and the trees about were
 dyed of a deep red with the ruddy blaze. Beyond the intermittent flashing
 of those two baleful fires no light to be seen; the brooding silence
 unbroken by any sound save those half-heard mutterings that pass through
 the air like harbingers of evil; about them, everywhere, the unfathomable
 abyss, dead and lifeless. Off there in the distance, very far away,
 perhaps, perhaps upon the ramparts, was a sound of someone weeping. It was
 all in vain that he strained his eyes to pierce the veil, to see something
 of Liry, la Marfee, the batteries of Frenois, and Wadelincourt, that
 encircling belt of bronze monsters of which he could instinctively feel
 the presence there, with their outstretched necks and yawning, ravenous
 muzzles. And as he recalled his glance and let it fall upon the city that
 lay around and beneath him, he heard its frightened breathing. It was not
 alone the unquiet slumbers of the soldiers who had fallen in the streets,
 the blending of inarticulate sounds produced by that gathering of guns,
 men, and horses; what he fancied he could distinguish was the insomnia,
 the alarmed watchfulness of his bourgeois neighbors, who, no more than he,
 could sleep, quivering with feverish terrors, awaiting anxiously the
 coming of the day. They all must be aware that the capitulation had not
 been signed, and were all counting the hours, quaking at the thought that
 should it not be signed the sole resource left them would be to go down
 into their cellars and wait for their own walls to tumble in on them and
 crush the life from their bodies. The voice of one in sore straits came
 up, it seemed to him, from the Rue des Voyards, shouting: "Help! murder!"
 amid the clash of arms. He bent over the terrace to look, then remained
 aloft there in the murky thickness of the night where there was not a star
 to cheer him, wrapped in such an ecstasy of terror that the hairs of his
 body stood erect.
 </p>
 <p>
 Below-stairs, at early daybreak, Maurice awoke upon his sofa. He was sore
 and stiff as if he had been racked; he did not stir, but lay looking
 listlessly at the windows, which gradually grew white under the light of a
 cloudy dawn. The hateful memories of the day before all came back to him
 with that distinctness that characterizes the impressions of our first
 waking, how they had fought, fled, surrendered. It all rose before his
 vision, down to the very least detail, and he brooded with horrible
 anguish on the defeat, whose reproachful echoes seemed to penetrate to the
 inmost fibers of his being, as if he felt that all the responsibility of
 it was his. And he went on to reason on the cause of the evil, analyzing
 himself, reverting to his old habit of bitter and unavailing
 self-reproach. He would have felt so brave, so glorious had victory
 remained with them! And now, in defeat, weak and nervous as a woman, he
 once again gave way to one of those overwhelming fits of despair in which
 the entire world, seemed to him to be foundering. Nothing was left them;
 the end of France was come. His frame was shaken by a storm of sobs, he
 wept hot tears, and joining his hands, the prayers of his childhood rose
 to his lips in stammering accents.
 </p>
 <p>
 "O God! take me unto Thee! O God! take unto Thyself all those who are
 weary and heavy-laden!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, lying on the floor wrapped in his bed-quilt, began to show some
 signs of life. Finally, astonished at what he heard, he arose to a sitting
 posture.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is the matter, youngster? Are you ill?" Then, with a glimmering
 perception of how matters stood, he adopted a more paternal tone. "Come,
 tell me what the matter is. You must not let yourself be worried by such a
 little thing as this, you know."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" exclaimed Maurice, "it is all up with us, <i>va</i>! we are
 Prussians now, and we may as well make up our mind to it."
 </p>
 <p>
 As the peasant, with the hard-headedness of the uneducated, expressed
 surprise to hear him talk thus, he endeavored to make it clear to him
 that, the race being degenerate and exhausted, it must disappear and make
 room for a newer and more vigorous strain. But the other, with an
 obstinate shake of the head, would not listen to the explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What! would you try to make me believe that my bit of land is no longer
 mine? that I would permit the Prussians to take it from me while I am
 alive and my two arms are left to me? Come, come!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then painfully, in such terms as he could command, he went on to tell how
 affairs looked to him. They had received an all-fired good basting, that
 was sure as sure could be! but they were not all dead yet, he didn't
 believe; there were some left, and those would suffice to rebuild the
 house if they only behaved themselves, working hard and not drinking up
 what they earned. When a family has trouble, if its members work and put
 by a little something, they will pull through, in spite of all the bad
 luck in the world. And further, it is not such a bad thing to get a good
 cuffing once in a way; it sets one thinking. And, great heavens! if a man
 has something rotten about him, if he has gangrene in his arms or legs
 that is spreading all the time, isn't it better to take a hatchet and lop
 them off rather than die as he would from cholera?
 </p>
 <p>
 "All up, all up! Ah, no, no! no, no!" he repeated several times. "It is
 not all up with me, I know very well it is not."
 </p>
 <p>
 And notwithstanding his seedy condition and demoralized appearance, his
 hair all matted and pasted to his head by the blood that had flowed from
 his wound, he drew himself up defiantly, animated by a keen desire to
 live, to take up the tools of his trade or put his hand to the plow, in
 order, to use his own expression, to "rebuild the house." He was of the
 old soil where reason and obstinacy grow side by side, of the land of toil
 and thrift.
 </p>
 <p>
 "All the same, though," he continued, "I am sorry for the Emperor. Affairs
 seemed to be going on well; the farmers were getting a good price for
 their grain. But surely it was bad judgment on his part to allow himself
 to become involved in this business!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who was still in "the blues," spoke regretfully: "Ah, the
 Emperor! I always liked him in my heart, in spite of my republican ideas.
 Yes, I had it in the blood, on account of my grandfather, I suppose. And
 now that that limb is rotten and we shall have to lop it off, what is
 going to become of us?"
 </p>
 <p>
 His eyes began to wander, and his voice and manner evinced such distress
 that Jean became alarmed and was about to rise and go to him, when
 Henriette came into the room. She had just awakened on hearing the sound
 of voices in the room adjoining hers. The pale light of a cloudy morning
 now illuminated the apartment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You come just in time to give him a scolding," he said, with an
 affectation of liveliness. "He is not a good boy this morning."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the sight of his sister's pale, sad face and the recollection of her
 affliction had had a salutary effect on Maurice by determining a sudden
 crisis of tenderness. He opened his arms and took her to his bosom, and
 when she rested her head upon his shoulder, when he held her locked in a
 close embrace, a feeling of great gentleness pervaded him and they mingled
 their tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my poor, poor darling, why have I not more strength and courage to
 console you! for my sorrows are as nothing compared with yours. That good,
 faithful Weiss, the husband who loved you so fondly! What will become of
 you? You have always been the victim; always, and never a murmur from your
 lips. Think of the sorrow I have already caused you, and who can say that
 I shall not cause you still more in the future!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She was silencing him, placing her hand upon his mouth, when Delaherche
 came into the room, beside himself with indignation. While still on the
 terrace he had been seized by one of those uncontrollable nervous fits of
 hunger that are aggravated by fatigue, and had descended to the kitchen in
 quest of something warm to drink, where he had found, keeping company with
 his cook, a relative of hers, a carpenter of Bazeilles, whom she was in
 the act of treating to a bowl of hot wine. This person, who had been one
 of the last to leave the place while the conflagrations were at their
 height, had told him that his dyehouse was utterly destroyed, nothing left
 of it but a heap of ruins.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The robbers, the thieves! Would you have believed it, <i>hein</i>?" he
 stammered, addressing Jean and Maurice. "There is no hope left; they mean
 to burn Sedan this morning as they burned Bazeilles yesterday. I'm ruined,
 I'm ruined!" The scar that Henriette bore on her forehead attracted his
 attention, and he remembered that he had not spoken to her yet. "It is
 true, you went there, after all; you got that wound&mdash;Ah! poor Weiss!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And seeing by the young woman's tears that she was acquainted with her
 husband's fate, he abruptly blurted out the horrible bit of news that the
 carpenter had communicated to him among the rest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Poor Weiss! it seems they burned him. Yes, after shooting all the
 civilians who were caught with arms in their hands, they threw their
 bodies into the flames of a burning house and poured petroleum over them."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette was horror-stricken as she listened. Her tears burst forth, her
 frame was shaken by her sobs. My God, my God, not even the poor comfort of
 going to claim her dear dead and give him decent sepulture; his ashes were
 to be scattered by the winds of heaven! Maurice had again clasped her in
 his arms and spoke to her endearingly, calling her his poor Cinderella,
 beseeching her not to take the matter so to heart, a brave woman as she
 was.
 </p>
 <p>
 After a time, during which no word was spoken, Delaherche, who had been
 standing at the window watching the growing day, suddenly turned and
 addressed the two soldiers:
 </p>
 <p>
 "By the way, I was near forgetting. What I came up here to tell you is
 this: down in the courtyard, in the shed where the treasure chests were
 deposited, there is an officer who is about to distribute the money among
 the men, so as to keep the Prussians from getting it. You had better go
 down, for a little money may be useful to you, that is, provided we are
 all alive a few hours hence."
 </p>
 <p>
 The advice was good, and Maurice and Jean acted on it, having first
 prevailed on Henriette to take her brother's place on the sofa. If she
 could not go to sleep again, she would at least be securing some repose.
 As for Delaherche, he passed through the adjoining chamber, where Gilberte
 with her tranquil, pretty face was slumbering still as soundly as a child,
 neither the sound of conversation nor even Henriette's sobs having availed
 to make her change her position. From there he went to the apartment where
 his mother was watching at Colonel de Vineuil's bedside, and thrust his
 head through the door; the old lady was asleep in her fauteuil, while the
 colonel, his eyes closed, was like a corpse. He opened them to their full
 extent and asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, it's all over, isn't it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Irritated by the question, which detained him at the very moment when he
 thought he should be able to slip away unobserved, Delaherche gave a
 wrathful look and murmured, sinking his voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, all over! until it begins again! There is nothing signed."
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel went on in a voice scarcely higher than a whisper; delirium
 was setting in.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Merciful God, let me die before the end! I do not hear the guns. Why have
 they ceased firing? Up there at Saint-Menges, at Fleigneux, we have
 command of all the roads; should the Prussians dare turn Sedan and attack
 us, we will drive them into the Meuse. The city is there, an
 insurmountable obstacle between us and them; our positions, too, are the
 stronger. Forward! the 7th corps will lead, the 12th will protect the
 retreat&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And his fingers kept drumming on the counterpane with a measured movement,
 as if keeping time with the trot of the charger he was riding in his
 vision. Gradually the motion became slower and slower as his words became
 more indistinct and he sank off into slumber. It ceased, and he lay
 motionless and still, as if the breath had left his body.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Lie still and rest," Delaherche whispered; "when I have news I will
 return."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, having first assured himself that he had not disturbed his mother's
 slumber, he slipped away and disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean and Maurice, on descending to the shed in the courtyard, had found
 there an officer of the pay department, seated on a common kitchen chair
 behind a little unpainted pine table, who, without pen, ink, or paper,
 without taking receipts or indulging in formalities of any kind, was
 dispensing fortunes. He simply stuck his hand into the open mouth of the
 bags filled with bright gold pieces, and as the sergeants of the 7th corps
 passed in line before him he filled their <i>kepis</i>, never counting
 what he bestowed with such rapid liberality. The understanding was that
 the sergeants were subsequently to divide what they received with the
 surviving men of their half-sections. Each of them received his portion
 awkwardly, as if it had been a ration of meat or coffee, then stalked off
 in an embarrassed, self-conscious sort of way, transferring the contents
 of the <i>kepi</i> to his trousers' pockets so as not to display his
 wealth to the world at large. And not a word was spoken; there was not a
 sound to be heard but the crystalline chink and rattle of the coin as it
 was received by those poor devils, dumfounded to see the responsibility of
 such riches thrust on them when there was not a place in the city where
 they could purchase a loaf of bread or a quart of wine.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean and Maurice appeared before him the officer, who was holding
 outstretched his hand filled, as usual, with louis, drew it back.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Neither of you fellows is a sergeant. No one except sergeants is entitled
 to receive the money." Then, in haste to be done with his task, he changed
 his mind: "Never mind, though; here, you corporal, take this. Step lively,
 now. Next man!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he dropped the gold coins into the <i>kepi</i> that Jean held out to
 him. The latter, oppressed by the magnitude of the amount, nearly six
 hundred francs, insisted that Maurice should take one-half. No one could
 say what might happen; they might be parted from each other.
 </p>
 <p>
 They made the division in the garden, before the ambulance, and when they
 had concluded their financial business they entered, having recognized on
 the straw near the entrance the drummer-boy of their company, Bastian, a
 fat, good-natured little fellow, who had had the ill-luck to receive a
 spent ball in the groin about five o'clock the day before, when the battle
 was ended. He had been dying by inches for the last twelve hours.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the dim, white light of morning, at that hour of awakening, the sight
 of the ambulance sent a chill of horror through them. Three more patients
 had died during the night, without anyone being aware of it, and the
 attendants were hurriedly bearing away the corpses in order to make room
 for others. Those who had been operated on the day before opened wide
 their eyes in their somnolent, semi-conscious state, and looked with dazed
 astonishment on that vast dormitory of suffering, where the victims of the
 knife, only half-slaughtered, rested on their straw. It was in vain that
 some attempts had been made the night before to clean up the room after
 the bloody work of the operations; there were great splotches of blood on
 the ill-swept floor; in a bucket of water a great sponge was floating,
 stained with red, for all the world like a human brain; a hand, its
 fingers crushed and broken, had been overlooked and lay on the floor of
 the shed. It was the parings and trimmings of the human butcher shop, the
 horrible waste and refuse that ensues upon a day of slaughter, viewed in
 the cold, raw light of dawn.
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche, who, after a few hours of repose, had already resumed his
 duties, stopped in front of the wounded drummer-boy, Bastian, then passed
 on with an imperceptible shrug of his shoulders. A hopeless case; nothing
 to be done. The lad had opened his eyes, however, and emerging from the
 comatose state in which he had been lying, was eagerly watching a sergeant
 who, his <i>kepi</i> filled with gold in his hand, had come into the room
 to see if there were any of his men among those poor wretches. He found
 two, and to each of them gave twenty francs. Other sergeants came in, and
 the gold began to fall in showers upon the straw, among the dying men.
 Bastian, who had managed to raise himself, stretched out his two hands,
 even then shaking in the final agony.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't forget me! don't forget me!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The sergeant would have passed on and gone his way, as Bouroche had done.
 What good could money do there? Then yielding to a kindly impulse, he
 threw some coins, never stopping to count them, into the poor hands that
 were already cold.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't forget me! don't forget me!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bastian fell backward on his straw. For a long time he groped with
 stiffening fingers for the elusive gold, which seemed to avoid him. And
 thus he died.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The gentleman has blown his candle out; good-night!" said a little,
 black, wizened zouave, who occupied the next bed. "It's vexatious, when
 one has the wherewithal to pay for wetting his whistle!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He had his left foot done up in splints. Nevertheless he managed to raise
 himself on his knees and elbows and in this posture crawl over to the dead
 man, whom he relieved of all his money, forcing open his hands, rummaging
 among his clothing and the folds of his capote. When he got back to his
 place, noticing that he was observed, he simply said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "There's no use letting the stuff be wasted, is there?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, sick at heart in that atmosphere of human distress and suffering,
 had long since dragged Jean away. As they passed out through the shed
 where the operations were performed they saw Bouroche preparing to
 amputate the leg of a poor little man of twenty, without chloroform, he
 having been unable to obtain a further supply of the anaesthetic. And they
 fled, running, so as not to hear the poor boy's shrieks.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche, who came in from the street just then, beckoned to them and
 shouted:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come upstairs, come, quick! we are going to have breakfast. The cook has
 succeeded in procuring some milk, and it is well she did, for we are all
 in great need of something to warm our stomachs." And notwithstanding his
 efforts to do so, he could not entirely repress his delight and
 exultation. With a radiant countenance he added, lowering his voice: "It
 is all right this time. General de Wimpffen has set out again for the
 German headquarters to sign the capitulation."
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, how much those words meant to him, what comfort there was in them,
 what relief! his horrid nightmare dispelled, his property saved from
 destruction, his daily life to be resumed, under changed conditions, it is
 true, but still it was to go on, it was not to cease! It was little Rose
 who had told him of the occurrences of the morning at the Sous-Prefecture;
 the girl had come hastening through the streets, now somewhat less choked
 than they had been, to obtain a supply of bread from an aunt of hers who
 kept a baker's shop in the quarter; it was striking nine o'clock. As early
 as eight General de Wimpffen had convened another council of war,
 consisting of more than thirty generals, to whom he related the results
 that had been reached so far, the hard conditions imposed by the
 victorious foe, and his own fruitless efforts to secure a mitigation of
 them. His emotion was such that his hands shook like a leaf, his eyes were
 suffused with tears. He was still addressing the assemblage when a colonel
 of the German staff presented himself, on behalf of General von Moltke, to
 remind them that, unless a decision were arrived at by ten o'clock, their
 guns would open fire on the city of Sedan. With this horrible alternative
 before them the council could do nothing save authorize the general to
 proceed once more to the Chateau of Bellevue and accept the terms of the
 victors. He must have accomplished his mission by that time, and the
 entire French army were prisoners of war.
 </p>
 <p>
 When she had concluded her narrative Rose launched out into a detailed
 account of the tremendous excitement the tidings had produced in the city.
 At the Sous-Prefecture she had seen officers tear the epaulettes from
 their shoulders, weeping meanwhile like children. Cavalrymen had thrown
 their sabers from the Pont de Meuse into the river; an entire regiment of
 cuirassiers had passed, each man tossing his blade over the parapet and
 sorrowfully watching the water close over it. In the streets many soldiers
 grasped their muskets by the barrel and smashed them against a wall, while
 there were artillerymen who removed the mechanism from the mitrailleuses
 and flung it into the sewer. Some there were who buried or burned the
 regimental standards. In the Place Turenne an old sergeant climbed upon a
 gate-post and harangued the throng as if he had suddenly taken leave of
 his senses, reviling the leaders, stigmatizing them as poltroons and
 cowards. Others seemed as if dazed, shedding big tears in silence, and
 others also, it must be confessed (and it is probable that they were in
 the majority), betrayed by their laughing eyes and pleased expression the
 satisfaction they felt at the change in affairs. There was an end to their
 suffering at last; they were prisoners of war, they could not be obliged
 to fight any more! For so many days they had been distressed by those
 long, weary marches, with never food enough to satisfy their appetite! And
 then, too, they were the weaker; what use was there in fighting? If their
 chiefs had betrayed them, had sold them to the enemy, so much the better;
 it would be the sooner ended! It was such a delicious thing to think of,
 that they were to have white bread to eat, were to sleep between sheets!
 </p>
 <p>
 As Delaherche was about to enter the dining room in company with Maurice
 and Jean, his mother called to him from above.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come up here, please; I am anxious about the colonel."
 </p>
 <p>
 M. de Vineuil, with wide-open eyes, was talking rapidly and excitedly of
 the subject that filled his bewildered brain.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The Prussians have cut us off from Mezieres, but what matters it! See,
 they have outmarched us and got possession of the plain of Donchery; soon
 they will be up with the wood of la Falizette and flank us there, while
 more of them are coming up along the valley of the Givonne. The frontier
 is behind us; let us kill as many of them as we can and cross it at a
 bound. Yesterday, yes, that is what I would have advised&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment his burning eyes lighted on Delaherche. He recognized him;
 the sight seemed to sober him and dispel the hallucination under which he
 was laboring, and coming back to the terrible reality, he asked for the
 third time:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is all over, is it not?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The manufacturer explosively blurted out the expression of his
 satisfaction; he could not restrain it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes, God be praised! it is all over, completely over. The
 capitulation must be signed by this time."
 </p>
 <p>
 The colonel raised himself at a bound to a sitting posture,
 notwithstanding his bandaged foot; he took his sword from the chair by the
 bedside where it lay and made an attempt to break it, but his hands
 trembled too violently, and the blade slipped from his fingers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look out! he will cut himself!" Delaherche cried in alarm. "Take that
 thing away from him; it is dangerous!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Mme. Delaherche took possession of the sword. With a feeling of
 compassionate respect for the poor colonel's grief and despair she did not
 conceal it, as her son bade her do, but with a single vigorous effort
 snapped it across her knee, with a strength of which she herself would
 never have supposed her poor old hands capable. The colonel laid himself
 down again, casting a look of extreme gentleness upon his old friend, who
 went back to her chair and seated herself in her usual rigid attitude.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the dining room the cook had meantime served bowls of hot coffee and
 milk for the entire party. Henriette and Gilberte had awakened, the
 latter, completely restored by her long and refreshing slumber, with
 bright eyes and smiling face; she embraced most tenderly her friend, whom
 she pitied, she said, from the bottom of her heart. Maurice seated himself
 beside his sister, while Jean, who was unused to polite society, but could
 not decline the invitation that was extended to him, was Delaherche's
 right-hand neighbor. It was Mme. Delaherche's custom not to come to the
 table with the family; a servant carried her a bowl, which she drank while
 sitting by the colonel. The party of five, however, who sat down together,
 although they commenced their meal in silence, soon became cheerful and
 talkative. Why should they not rejoice and be glad to find themselves
 there, safe and sound, with food before them to satisfy their hunger, when
 the country round about was covered with thousands upon thousands of poor
 starving wretches? In the cool, spacious dining room the snow-white
 tablecloth was a delight to the eye and the steaming <i>cafe au lait</i>
 seemed delicious.
 </p>
 <p>
 They conversed, Delaherche, who had recovered his assurance and was again
 the wealthy manufacturer, the condescending patron courting popularity,
 severe only toward those who failed to succeed, spoke of Napoleon III.,
 whose face as he saw it last continued to haunt his memory. He addressed
 himself to Jean, having that simple-minded young man as his neighbor.
 "Yes, sir, the Emperor has deceived me, and I don't hesitate to say so.
 His henchmen may put in the plea of mitigating circumstances, but it won't
 go down, sir; he is evidently the first, the only cause of our
 misfortunes."
 </p>
 <p>
 He had quite forgotten that only a few months before he had been an ardent
 Bonapartist and had labored to ensure the success of the plebiscite, and
 now he who was henceforth to be known as the Man of Sedan was not even
 worthy to be pitied; he ascribed to him every known iniquity.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A man of no capacity, as everyone is now compelled to admit; but let that
 pass, I say nothing of that. A visionary, a theorist, an unbalanced mind,
 with whom affairs seemed to succeed as long as he had luck on his side.
 And there's no use, don't you see, sir, in attempting to work on our
 sympathies and excite our commiseration by telling us that he was
 deceived, that the opposition refused him the necessary grants of men and
 money. It is he who has deceived us, he whose crimes and blunders have
 landed us in the horrible muddle where we are."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who preferred to say nothing on the subject, could not help
 smiling, while Jean, embarrassed by the political turn the conversation
 had taken and fearful lest he might make some ill-timed remark, simply
 replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "They say he is a brave man, though."
 </p>
 <p>
 But those few words, modestly expressed, fairly made Delaherche jump. All
 his past fear and alarm, all the mental anguish he had suffered, burst
 from his lips in a cry of concentrated passion, closely allied to hatred.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A brave man, forsooth; and what does that amount to! Are you aware, sir,
 that my factory was struck three times by Prussian shells, and that it is
 no fault of the Emperor's that it was not burned! Are you aware that I, I
 shall lose a hundred thousand francs by this idiotic business! No, no;
 France invaded, pillaged, and laid waste, our industries compelled to shut
 down, our commerce ruined; it is a little too much, I tell you! One brave
 man like that is quite sufficient; may the Lord preserve us from any more
 of them! He is down in the blood and mire, and there let him remain!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he made a forcible gesture with his closed fist as if thrusting down
 and holding under the water some poor wretch who was struggling to save
 himself, then finished his coffee, smacking his lips like a true gourmand.
 Gilberte waited on Henriette as if she had been a child, laughing a little
 involuntary laugh when the latter made some exhibition of
 absent-mindedness. And when at last the coffee had all been drunk they
 still lingered on in the peaceful quiet of the great cool dining room.
 </p>
 <p>
 And at that same hour Napoleon III. was in the weaver's lowly cottage on
 the Donchery road. As early as five o'clock in the morning he had insisted
 on leaving the Sous-Prefecture; he felt ill at ease in Sedan, which was at
 once a menace and a reproach to him, and moreover he thought he might, in
 some measure, alleviate the sufferings of his tender heart by obtaining
 more favorable terms for his unfortunate army. His object was to have a
 personal interview with the King of Prussia. He had taken his place in a
 hired caleche and been driven along the broad highway, with its row of
 lofty poplars on either side, and this first stage of his journey into
 exile, accomplished in the chill air of early dawn, must have reminded him
 forcibly of the grandeur that had been his and that he was putting behind
 him forever. It was on this road that he had his encounter with Bismarck,
 who came hurrying to meet him in an old cap and coarse, greased boots,
 with the sole object of keeping him occupied and preventing him from
 seeing the King until the capitulation should have been signed. The King
 was still at Vendresse, some nine miles away. Where was he to go? What
 roof would afford him shelter while he waited? In his own country, so far
 away, the Palace of the Tuileries had disappeared from his sight,
 swallowed up in the bosom of a storm-cloud, and he was never to see it
 more. Sedan seemed already to have receded into the distance, leagues and
 leagues, and to be parted from him by a river of blood. In France there
 were no longer imperial chateaus, nor official residences, nor even a
 chimney-nook in the house of the humblest functionary, where he would have
 dared to enter and claim hospitality. And it was in the house of the
 weaver that he determined to seek shelter, the squalid cottage that stood
 close to the roadside, with its scanty kitchen-garden inclosed by a hedge
 and its front of a single story with little forbidding windows. The room
 above-stairs was simply whitewashed and had a tiled floor; the only
 furniture was a common pine table and two straw-bottomed chairs. He spent
 two hours there, at first in company with Bismarck, who smiled to hear him
 speak of generosity, after that alone in silent misery, flattening his
 ashy face against the panes, taking his last look at French soil and at
 the Meuse, winding in and out, so beautiful, among the broad fertile
 fields.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then the next day and the days that came after were other wretched stages
 of that journey; the Chateau of Bellevue, a pretty bourgeois retreat
 overlooking the river, where he rested that night, where he shed tears
 after his interview with King William; the sorrowful departure, that most
 miserable flight in a hired caleche over remote roads to the north of the
 city, which he avoided, not caring to face the wrath of the vanquished
 troops and the starving citizens, making a wide circuit over cross-roads
 by Floing, Fleigneux, and Illy and crossing the stream on a bridge of
 boats, laid down by the Prussians at Iges; the tragic encounter, the story
 of which has been so often told, that occurred on the corpse-cumbered
 plateau of Illy: the miserable Emperor, whose state was such that his
 horse could not be allowed to trot, had sunk under some more than usually
 violent attack of his complaint, mechanically smoking, perhaps, his
 everlasting cigarette, when a band of haggard, dusty, blood-stained
 prisoners, who were being conducted from Fleigneux to Sedan, were forced
 to leave the road to let the carriage pass and stood watching it from the
 ditch; those who were at the head of the line merely eyed him in silence;
 presently a hoarse, sullen murmur began to make itself heard, and finally,
 as the caleche proceeded down the line, the men burst out with a storm of
 yells and cat-calls, shaking their fists and calling down maledictions on
 the head of him who had been their ruler. After that came the interminable
 journey across the battlefield, as far as Givonne, amid scenes of havoc
 and devastation, amid the dead, who lay with staring eyes upturned that
 seemed to be full of menace; came, too, the bare, dreary fields, the great
 silent forest, then the frontier, running along the summit of a ridge,
 marked only by a stone, facing a wooden post that seemed ready to fall,
 and beyond the soil of Belgium, the end of all, with its road bordered
 with gloomy hemlocks descending sharply into the narrow valley.
 </p>
 <p>
 And that first night of exile, that he spent at a common inn, the Hotel de
 la Poste at Bouillon, what a night it was! When the Emperor showed himself
 at his window in deference to the throng of French refugees and
 sight-seers that filled the place, he was greeted with a storm of hisses
 and hostile murmurs. The apartment assigned him, the three windows of
 which opened on the public square and on the Semoy, was the typical tawdry
 bedroom of the provincial inn with its conventional furnishings: the
 chairs covered with crimson damask, the mahogany <i>armoire a glace</i>,
 and on the mantel the imitation bronze clock, flanked by a pair of conch
 shells and vases of artificial flowers under glass covers. On either side
 of the door was a little single bed, to one of which the wearied
 aide-de-camp betook himself at nine o'clock and was immediately wrapped in
 soundest slumber. On the other the Emperor, to whom the god of sleep was
 less benignant, tossed almost the whole night through, and if he arose to
 try to quiet his excited nerves by walking, the sole distraction that his
 eyes encountered was a pair of engravings that were hung to right and left
 of the chimney, one depicting Rouget de Lisle singing the Marseillaise,
 the other a crude representation of the Last Judgment, the dead rising
 from their graves at the sound of the Archangel's trump, the resurrection
 of the victims of the battlefield, about to appear before their God to
 bear witness against their rulers.
 </p>
 <p>
 The imperial baggage train, cause in its day of so much scandal, had been
 left behind at Sedan, where it rested in ignominious hiding behind the
 Sous-Prefet's lilac bushes. It puzzled the authorities somewhat to devise
 means for ridding themselves of what was to them a <i>bete noire</i>, for
 getting it away from the city unseen by the famishing multitude, upon whom
 the sight of its flaunting splendor would have produced much the same
 effect that a red rag does on a maddened bull. They waited until there
 came an unusually dark night, when horses, carriages, and baggage-wagons,
 with their silver stew-pans, plate, linen, and baskets of fine wines, all
 trooped out of Sedan in deepest mystery and shaped their course for
 Belgium, noiselessly, without beat of drum, over the least frequented
 roads like a thief stealing away in the night.

 </h2>
 <p>
 All the long, long day of the battle Silvine, up on Remilly hill, where
 Father Fouchard's little farm was situated, but her heart and soul absent
 with Honore amid the dangers of the conflict, never once took her eyes
 from off Sedan, where the guns were roaring. The following day, moreover,
 her anxiety was even greater still, being increased by her inability to
 obtain any definite tidings, for the Prussians who were guarding the roads
 in the vicinity refused to answer questions, as much from reasons of
 policy as because they knew but very little themselves. The bright sun of
 the day before was no longer visible, and showers had fallen, making the
 valley look less cheerful than usual in the wan light.
 </p>
 <p>
 Toward evening Father Fouchard, who was also haunted by a sensation of
 uneasiness in the midst of his studied taciturnity, was standing on his
 doorstep reflecting on the probable outcome of events. His son had no
 place in his thoughts, but he was speculating how he best might convert
 the misfortunes of others into fortune for himself, and as he revolved
 these considerations in his mind he noticed a tall, strapping young
 fellow, dressed in the peasant's blouse, who had been strolling up and
 down the road for the last minute or so, looking as if he did not know
 what to do with himself. His astonishment on recognizing him was so great
 that he called him aloud by name, notwithstanding that three Prussians
 happened to be passing at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, Prosper! Is that you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The chasseur d'Afrique imposed silence on him with an emphatic gesture;
 then, coming closer, he said in an undertone:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is I. I have had enough of fighting for nothing, and I cut my
 lucky. Say, Father Fouchard, you don't happen to be in need of a laborer
 on your farm, do you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 All the old man's prudence came back to him in a twinkling. He <i>was</i>
 looking for someone to help him, but it would be better not to say so at
 once.
 </p>
 <p>
 "A lad on the farm? faith, no&mdash;not just now. Come in, though, all the
 same, and have a glass. I shan't leave you out on the road when you're in
 trouble, that's sure."
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, in the kitchen, was setting the pot of soup on the fire, while
 little Charlot was hanging by her skirts, frolicking and laughing. She did
 not recognize Prosper at first, although they had formerly served together
 in the same household, and it was not until she came in, bringing a bottle
 of wine and two glasses, that she looked him squarely in the face. She
 uttered a cry of joy and surprise; her sole thought was of Honore.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, you were there, weren't you? Is Honore all right?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper's answer was ready to slip from his tongue; he hesitated. For the
 last two days he had been living in a dream, among a rapid succession of
 strange, ill-defined events which left behind them no precise memory, as a
 man starts, half-awakened, from a slumber peopled with fantastic visions.
 It was true, doubtless, he believed he had seen Honore lying upon a
 cannon, dead, but he would not have cared to swear to it; what use is
 there in afflicting people when one is not certain?
 </p>
 <p>
 "Honore," he murmured, "I don't know, I couldn't say."
 </p>
 <p>
 She continued to press him with her questions, looking at him steadily.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You did not see him, then?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He waved his hands before him with a slow, uncertain motion and an
 expressive shake of the head.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How can you expect one to remember! There were such lots of things, such
 lots of things. Look you, of all that d&mdash;&mdash;-d battle, if I was
 to die for it this minute, I could not tell you that much&mdash;no, not
 even the place where I was. I believe men get to be no better than idiots,
 'pon my word I do!" And tossing off a glass of wine, he sat gloomily
 silent, his vacant eyes turned inward on the dark recesses of his memory.
 "All that I remember is that it was beginning to be dark when I recovered
 consciousness. I went down while we were charging, and then the sun was
 very high. I must have been lying there for hours, my right leg caught
 under poor old Zephyr, who had received a piece of shell in the middle of
 his chest. There was nothing to laugh at in my position, I can tell you;
 the dead comrades lying around me in piles, not a living soul in sight,
 and the certainty that I should have to kick the bucket too unless someone
 came to put me on my legs again. Gently, gently, I tried to free my leg,
 but it was no use; Zephyr's weight must have been fully up to that of the
 five hundred thousand devils. He was warm still. I patted him, I spoke to
 him, saying all the pretty things I could think of, and here's a thing, do
 you see, that I shall never forget as long as I live: he opened his eyes
 and made an effort to raise his poor old head, which was resting on the
 ground beside my own. Then we had a talk together: 'Poor old fellow,' says
 I, 'I don't want to say a word to hurt your feelings, but you must want to
 see me croak with you, you hold me down so hard.' Of course he didn't say
 he did; he couldn't, but for all that I could read in his great sorrowful
 eyes how bad he felt to have to part with me. And I can't say how the
 thing happened, whether he intended it or whether it was part of the death
 struggle, but all at once he gave himself a great shake that sent him
 rolling away to one side. I was enabled to get on my feet once more, but
 ah! in what a pickle; my leg was swollen and heavy as a leg of lead. Never
 mind, I took Zephyr's head in my arms and kept on talking to him, telling
 him all the kind thoughts I had in my heart, that he was a good horse,
 that I loved him dearly, that I should never forget him. He listened to
 me, he seemed to be so pleased! Then he had another long convulsion, and
 so he died, with his big vacant eyes fixed on me till the last. It is very
 strange, though, and I don't suppose anyone will believe me; still, it is
 the simple truth that great, big tears were standing in his eyes. Poor old
 Zephyr, he cried just like a man&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 At this point Prosper's emotion got the better of him; tears choked his
 utterance and he was obliged to break off. He gulped down another glass of
 wine and went on with his narrative in disjointed, incomplete sentences.
 It kept growing darker and darker, until there was only a narrow streak of
 red light on the horizon at the verge of the battlefield; the shadows of
 the dead horses seemed to be projected across the plain to an infinite
 distance. The pain and stiffness in his leg kept him from moving; he must
 have remained for a long time beside Zephyr. Then, with his fears as an
 incentive, he had managed to get on his feet and hobble away; it was an
 imperative necessity to him not to be alone, to find comrades who would
 share his fears with him and make them less. Thus from every nook and
 corner of the battlefield, from hedges and ditches and clumps of bushes,
 the wounded who had been left behind dragged themselves painfully in
 search of companionship, forming when possible little bands of four or
 five, finding it less hard to agonize and die in the company of their
 fellow-beings. In the wood of la Garenne Prosper fell in with two men of
 the 43d regiment; they were not wounded, but had burrowed in the
 underbrush like rabbits, waiting for the coming of the night. When they
 learned that he was familiar with the roads they communicated to him their
 plan, which was to traverse the woods under cover of the darkness and make
 their escape into Belgium. At first he declined to share their
 undertaking, for he would have preferred to proceed direct to Remilly,
 where he was certain to find a refuge, but where was he to obtain the
 blouse and trousers that he required as a disguise? to say nothing of the
 impracticability of getting past the numerous Prussian pickets and
 outposts that filled the valley all the way from la Garenne to Remilly. He
 therefore ended by consenting to act as guide to the two comrades. His leg
 was less stiff than it had been, and they were so fortunate as to secure a
 loaf of bread at a farmhouse. Nine o'clock was striking from the church of
 a village in the distance as they resumed their way. The only point where
 they encountered any danger worth mentioning was at la Chapelle, where
 they fell directly into the midst of a Prussian advanced post before they
 were aware of it; the enemy flew to arms and blazed away into the
 darkness, while they, throwing themselves on the ground and alternately
 crawling and running until the fire slackened, ultimately regained the
 shelter of the trees. After that they kept to the woods, observing the
 utmost vigilance. At a bend in the road, they crept up behind an out-lying
 picket and, leaping on his back, buried a knife in his throat. Then the
 road was free before them and they no longer had to observe precaution;
 they went ahead, laughing and whistling. It was about three in the morning
 when they reached a little Belgian village, where they knocked up a worthy
 farmer, who at once opened his barn to them; they snuggled among the hay
 and slept soundly until morning.
 </p>
 <p>
 The sun was high in the heavens when Prosper awoke. As he opened his eyes
 and looked about him, while the two comrades were still snoring, he beheld
 their entertainer engaged in hitching a horse to a great carriole loaded
 with bread, rice, coffee, sugar, and all sorts of eatables, the whole
 concealed under sacks of charcoal, and a little questioning elicited from
 the good man the fact that he had two married daughters living at
 Raucourt, in France, whom the passage of the Bavarian troops had left
 entirely destitute, and that the provisions in the carriole were intended
 for them. He had procured that very morning the safe-conduct that was
 required for the journey. Prosper was immediately seized by an
 uncontrollable desire to take a seat in that carriole and return to the
 country that he loved so and for which his heart was yearning with such a
 violent nostalgia. It was perfectly simple; the farmer would have to pass
 through Remilly to reach Raucourt; he would alight there. The matter was
 arranged in three minutes; he obtained a loan of the longed-for blouse and
 trousers, and the farmer gave out, wherever they stopped, that he was his
 servant; so that about six o'clock he got down in front of the church, not
 having been stopped more than two or three times by the German outposts.
 </p>
 <p>
 They were all silent for a while, then: "No, I had enough of it!" said
 Prosper. "If they had but set us at work that amounted to something, as
 out there in Africa! but this going up the hill only to come down again,
 the feeling that one is of no earthly use to anyone, that is no kind of a
 life at all. And then I should be lonely, now that poor Zephyr is dead;
 all that is left me to do is to go to work on a farm. That will be better
 than living among the Prussians as a prisoner, don't you think so? You
 have horses, Father Fouchard; try me, and see whether or not I will love
 them and take good care of them."
 </p>
 <p>
 The old fellow's eyes gleamed, but he touched glasses once more with the
 other and concluded the arrangement without any evidence of eagerness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well; I wish to be of service to you as far as lies in my power; I
 will take you. As regards the question of wages, though, you must not
 speak of it until the war is over, for really I am not in need of anyone
 and the times are too hard."
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, who had remained seated with Charlot on her lap, had never once
 taken her eyes from Prosper's face. When she saw him rise with the
 intention of going to the stable and making immediate acquaintance with
 its four-footed inhabitants, she again asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Then you say you did not see Honore?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The question repeated thus abruptly made him start, as if it had suddenly
 cast a flood of light in upon an obscure corner of his memory. He
 hesitated for a little, but finally came to a decision and spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, I did not wish to grieve you just now, but I don't believe
 Honore will ever come back."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never come back&mdash;what do you mean?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, I believe that the Prussians did his business for him. I saw him
 lying across his gun, his head erect, with a great wound just beneath the
 heart."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was silence in the room. Silvine's pallor was frightful to behold,
 while Father Fouchard displayed his interest in the narrative by replacing
 upon the table his glass, into which he had just poured what wine remained
 in the bottle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you quite certain?" she asked in a choking voice.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>! as certain as one can be of a thing he has seen with his own
 two eyes. It was on a little hillock, with three trees in a group right
 beside it; it seems to me I could go to the spot blindfolded."
 </p>
 <p>
 If it was true she had nothing left to live for. That lad who had been so
 good to her, who had forgiven her her fault, had plighted his troth and
 was to marry her when he came home at the end of the campaign! and they
 had robbed her of him, they had murdered him, and he was lying out there
 on the battlefield with a wound under the heart! She had never known how
 strong her love for him had been, and now the thought that she was to see
 him no more, that he who was hers was hers no longer, aroused her almost
 to a pitch of madness and made her forget her usual tranquil resignation.
 She set Charlot roughly down upon the floor, exclaiming:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good! I shall not believe that story until I see the evidence of it,
 until I see it with my own eyes. Since you know the spot you shall conduct
 me to it. And if it is true, if we find him, we will bring him home with
 us."
 </p>
 <p>
 Her tears allowed her to say no more; she bowed her head upon the table,
 her frame convulsed by long-drawn, tumultuous sobs that shook her from
 head to foot, while the child, not knowing what to make of such unusual
 treatment at his mother's hands, also commenced to weep violently. She
 caught him up and pressed him to her heart, with distracted, stammering
 words:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My poor child! my poor child!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Consternation was depicted on old Fouchard's face. Appearances
 notwithstanding, he did love his son, after a fashion of his own. Memories
 of the past came back to him, of days long vanished, when his wife was
 still living and Honore was a boy at school, and two big tears appeared in
 his small red eyes and trickled down his old leathery cheeks. He had not
 wept before in more than ten years. In the end he grew angry at the
 thought of that son who was his and upon whom he was never to set eyes
 again; he rapped out an oath or two.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> it is provoking all the same, to have only one boy,
 and that he should be taken from you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When their agitation had in a measure subsided, however, Fouchard was
 annoyed that Silvine still continued to talk of going to search for
 Honore's body out there on the battlefield. She made no further noisy
 demonstration, but harbored her purpose with the dogged silence of
 despair, and he failed to recognize in her the docile, obedient servant
 who was wont to perform her daily tasks without a murmur; her great,
 submissive eyes, in which lay the chief beauty of her face, had assumed an
 expression of stern determination, while beneath her thick brown hair her
 cheeks and brow wore a pallor that was like death. She had torn off the
 red kerchief that was knotted about her neck, and was entirely in black,
 like a widow in her weeds. It was all in vain that he tried to impress on
 her the difficulties of the undertaking, the dangers she would be
 subjected to, the little hope there was of recovering the corpse; she did
 not even take the trouble to answer him, and he saw clearly that unless he
 seconded her in her plan she would start out alone and do some unwise
 thing, and this aspect of the case worried him on account of the
 complications that might arise between him and the Prussian authorities.
 He therefore finally decided to go and lay the matter before the mayor of
 Remilly, who was a kind of distant cousin of his, and they two between
 them concocted a story: Silvine was to pass as the actual widow of Honore,
 Prosper became her brother, so that the Bavarian colonel, who had his
 quarters in the Hotel of the Maltese Cross down in the lower part of the
 village, made no difficulty about granting a pass which authorized the
 brother and sister to bring home the body of the husband, provided they
 could find it. By this time it was night; the only concession that could
 be obtained from the young woman was that she would delay starting on her
 expedition until morning.
 </p>
 <p>
 When morning came old Fouchard could not be prevailed on to allow one of
 his horses to be taken, fearing he might never set eyes on it again. What
 assurance had he that the Prussians would not confiscate the entire
 equipage? At last he consented, though with very bad grace, to loan her
 the donkey, a little gray animal, and his cart, which, though small, would
 be large enough to hold a dead man. He gave minute instructions to
 Prosper, who had had a good night's sleep, but was anxious and thoughtful
 at the prospect of the expedition now that, being rested and refreshed, he
 attempted to remember something of the battle. At the last moment Silvine
 went and took the counterpane from her own bed, folding and spreading it
 on the floor of the cart. Just as she was about to start she came running
 back to embrace Charlot.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I entrust him to your care, Father Fouchard; keep an eye on him and see
 that he doesn't get hold of the matches."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes; never fear!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They were late in getting off; it was near seven o'clock when the little
 procession, the donkey, hanging his head and drawing the narrow cart,
 leading, descended the steep hill of Remilly. It had rained heavily during
 the night, and the roads were become rivers of mud; great lowering clouds
 hung in the heavens, imparting an air of cheerless desolation to the
 scene.
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper, wishing to save all the distance he could, had determined on
 taking the route that lay through the city of Sedan, but before they
 reached Pont-Maugis a Prussian outpost halted the cart and held it for
 over an hour, and finally, after their pass had been referred, one after
 another, to four or five officials, they were told they might resume their
 journey, but only on condition of taking the longer, roundabout route by
 way of Bazeilles, to do which they would have to turn into a cross-road on
 their left. No reason was assigned; their object was probably to avoid
 adding to the crowd that encumbered the streets of the city. When Silvine
 crossed the Meuse by the railroad bridge, that ill-starred bridge that the
 French had failed to destroy and which, moreover, had been the cause of
 such slaughter among the Bavarians, she beheld the corpse of an
 artilleryman floating lazily down with the sluggish current. It caught
 among some rushes near the bank, hung there a moment, then swung clear and
 started afresh on its downward way.
 </p>
 <p>
 Bazeilles, through which they passed from end to end at a slow walk,
 afforded a spectacle of ruin and desolation, the worst that war can
 perpetrate when it sweeps with devastating force, like a cyclone, through
 a land. The dead had been removed; there was not a single corpse to be
 seen in the village streets, and the rain had washed away the blood; pools
 of reddish water were to be seen here and there in the roadway, with
 repulsive, frowzy-looking debris, matted masses that one could not help
 associating in his mind with human hair. But what shocked and saddened one
 more than all the rest was the ruin that was visible everywhere; that
 charming village, only three days before so bright and smiling, with its
 pretty houses standing in their well-kept gardens, now razed, demolished,
 annihilated, nothing left of all its beauties save a few smoke-stained
 walls. The church was burning still, a huge pyre of smoldering beams and
 girders, whence streamed continually upward a column of dense black smoke
 that, spreading in the heavens, overshadowed the city like a gigantic
 funeral pall. Entire streets had been swept away, not a house left on
 either side, nor any trace that houses had ever been there, save the
 calcined stone-work lying in the gutter in a pasty mess of soot and ashes,
 the whole lost in the viscid, ink-black mud of the thoroughfare. Where
 streets intersected the corner houses were razed down to their
 foundations, as if they had been carried away bodily by the fiery blast
 that blew there. Others had suffered less; one in particular, owing to
 some chance, had escaped almost without injury, while its neighbors on
 either hand, literally torn to pieces by the iron hail, were like gaunt
 skeletons. An unbearable stench was everywhere, noticeable, the nauseating
 odor that follows a great fire, aggravated by the penetrating smell of
 petroleum, that had been used without stint upon floors and walls. Then,
 too, there was the pitiful, mute spectacle of the household goods that the
 people had endeavored to save, the poor furniture that had been thrown
 from windows and smashed upon the sidewalk, crazy tables with broken legs,
 presses with cloven sides and split doors, linen, also, torn and soiled,
 that was trodden under foot; all the sorry crumbs, the unconsidered
 trifles of the pillage, of which the destruction was being completed by
 the dissolving rain. Through the breach in a shattered house-front a clock
 was visible, securely fastened high up on the wall above the mantel-shelf,
 that had miraculously escaped intact.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The beasts! the pigs!" growled Prosper, whose blood, though he was no
 longer a soldier, ran hot at the sight of such atrocities.
 </p>
 <p>
 He doubled his fists, and Silvine, who was white as a ghost, had to exert
 the influence of her glance to calm him every time they encountered a
 sentry on their way. The Bavarians had posted sentinels near all the
 houses that were still burning, and it seemed as if those men, with loaded
 muskets and fixed bayonets, were guarding the fires in order that the
 flames might finish their work. They drove away the mere sightseers who
 strolled about in the vicinity, and the persons who had an interest there
 as well, employing first a menacing gesture, and in case that was not
 sufficient, uttering a single brief, guttural word of command. A young
 woman, her hair streaming about her shoulders, her gown plastered with
 mud, persisted in hanging about the smoking ruins of a little house, of
 which she desired to search the hot ashes, notwithstanding the prohibition
 of the sentry. The report ran that the woman's little baby had been burned
 with the house. And all at once, as the Bavarian was roughly thrusting her
 aside with his heavy hand, she turned on him, vomiting in his face all her
 despair and rage, lashing him with taunts and insults that were redolent
 of the gutter, with obscene words which likely afforded her some
 consolation in her grief and distress. He could not have understood her,
 for he drew back a pace or two, eying her with apprehension. Three
 comrades came running up and relieved him of the fury, whom they led away
 screaming at the top of her voice. Before the ruins of another house a man
 and two little girls, all three so weary and miserable that they could not
 stand, lay on the bare ground, sobbing as if their hearts would break;
 they had seen their little all go up in smoke and flame, and had no place
 to go, no place to lay their head. But just then a patrol went by,
 dispersing the knots of idlers, and the street again assumed its deserted
 aspect, peopled only by the stern, sullen sentries, vigilant to see that
 their iniquitous instructions were enforced.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The beasts! the pigs!" Prosper repeated in a stifled voice. "How I should
 like, oh! how I should like to kill a few of them!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine again made him be silent. She shuddered. A dog, shut up in a
 carriage-house that the flames had spared and forgotten there for the last
 two days, kept up an incessant, continuous howling, in a key so
 inexpressibly mournful that a brooding horror seemed to pervade the low,
 leaden sky, from which a drizzling rain had now begun to fall. They were
 then just abreast of the park of Montivilliers, and there they witnessed a
 most horrible sight. Three great covered carts, those carts that pass
 along the streets in the early morning before it is light and collect the
 city's filth and garbage, stood there in a row, loaded with corpses; and
 now, instead of refuse, they were being filled with dead, stopping
 wherever there was a body to be loaded, then going on again with the heavy
 rumbling of their wheels to make another stop further on, threading
 Bazeilles in its every nook and corner until their hideous cargo
 overflowed. They were waiting now upon the public road to be driven to the
 place of their discharge, the neighboring potter's field. Feet were seen
 projecting from the mass into the air. A head, half-severed from its
 trunk, hung over the side of the vehicle. When the three lumbering vans
 started again, swaying and jolting over the inequalities of the road, a
 long, white hand was hanging outward from one of them; the hand caught
 upon the wheel, and little by little the iron tire destroyed it, eating
 through skin and flesh clean down to the bones.
 </p>
 <p>
 By the time they reached Balan the rain had ceased, and Prosper prevailed
 on Silvine to eat a bit of the bread he had had the foresight to bring
 with them. When they were near Sedan, however, they were brought to a halt
 by another Prussian post, and this time the consequences threatened to be
 serious; the officer stormed at them, and even refused to restore their
 pass, which he declared, in excellent French, to be a forgery. Acting on
 his orders some soldiers had run the donkey and the little cart under a
 shed. What were they to do? were they to be forced to abandon their
 undertaking? Silvine was in despair, when all at once she thought of M.
 Dubreuil, Father Fouchard's relative, with whom she had some slight
 acquaintance and whose place, the Hermitage, was only a few hundred yards
 distant, on the summit of the eminence that overlooked the faubourg.
 Perhaps he might have some influence with the military, seeing that he was
 a citizen of the place. As they were allowed their freedom, conditionally
 upon abandoning their equipage, she left the donkey and cart under the
 shed and bade Prosper accompany her. They ascended the hill on a run,
 found the gate of the Hermitage standing wide open, and on turning into
 the avenue of secular elms beheld a spectacle that filled them with
 amazement.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The devil!" said Prosper; "there are a lot of fellows who seem to be
 taking things easy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 On the fine-crushed gravel of the terrace, at the bottom of the steps that
 led to the house, was a merry company. Arranged in order around a
 marble-topped table were a sofa and some easy-chairs in sky-blue satin,
 forming a sort of fantastic open-air drawing-room, which must have been
 thoroughly soaked by the rain of the preceding day. Two zouaves, seated in
 a lounging attitude at either end of the sofa, seemed to be laughing
 boisterously. A little infantryman, who occupied one of the fauteuils, his
 head bent forward, was apparently holding his sides to keep them from
 splitting. Three others were seated in a negligent pose, their elbows
 resting on the arms of their chairs, while a chasseur had his hand
 extended as if in the act of taking a glass from the table. They had
 evidently discovered the location of the cellar, and were enjoying
 themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
 "But how in the world do they happen to be here?" murmured Prosper, whose
 stupefaction increased as he drew nearer to them. "Have the rascals
 forgotten there are Prussians about?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Silvine, whose eyes had dilated far beyond their natural size,
 suddenly uttered an exclamation of horror. The soldiers never moved hand
 or foot; they were stone dead. The two zouaves were stiff and cold; they
 both had had the face shot away, the nose was gone, the eyes were torn
 from their sockets. If there appeared to be a laugh on the face of him who
 was holding his sides, it was because a bullet had cut a great furrow
 through the lower portion of his countenance, smashing all his teeth. The
 spectacle was an unimaginably horrible one, those poor wretches laughing
 and conversing in their attitude of manikins, with glassy eyes and open
 mouths, when Death had laid his icy hand on them and they were never more
 to know the warmth and motion of life. Had they dragged themselves, still
 living, to that place, so as to die in one another's company? or was it
 not rather a ghastly prank of the Prussians, who had collected the bodies
 and placed them in a circle about the table, out of derision for the
 traditional gayety of the French nation?
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's a queer start, though, all the same," muttered Prosper, whose face
 was very pale. And casting a look at the other dead who lay scattered
 about the avenue, under the trees and on the turf, some thirty brave
 fellows, among them Lieutenant Rochas, riddled with wounds and surrounded
 still by the shreds of the flag, he added seriously and with great
 respect: "There must have been some very pretty fighting about here! I
 don't much believe we shall find the bourgeois for whom you are looking."
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine entered the house, the doors and windows of which had been
 battered in and afforded admission to the damp, cold air from without. It
 was clear enough that there was no one there; the masters must have taken
 their departure before the battle. She continued to prosecute her search,
 however, and had entered the kitchen, when she gave utterance to another
 cry of terror. Beneath the sink were two bodies, fast locked in each
 other's arms in mortal embrace, one of them a zouave, a handsome,
 brown-bearded man, the other a huge Prussian with red hair. The teeth of
 the former were set in the latter's cheek, their arms, stiff in death, had
 not relaxed their terrible hug, binding the pair with such a bond of
 everlasting hate and fury that ultimately it was found necessary to bury
 them in a common grave.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Prosper made haste to lead Silvine away, since they could accomplish
 nothing in that house where Death had taken up his abode, and upon their
 return, despairing, to the post where the donkey and cart had been
 detained, it so chanced that they found, in company with the officer who
 had treated them so harshly, a general on his way to visit the
 battlefield. This gentleman requested to be allowed to see the pass, which
 he examined attentively and restored to Silvine; then, with an expression
 of compassion on his face, he gave directions that the poor woman should
 have her donkey returned to her and be allowed to go in quest of her
 husband's body. Stopping only long enough to thank her benefactor, she and
 her companion, with the cart trundling after them, set out for the Fond de
 Givonne, obedient to the instructions that were again given them not to
 pass through Sedan.
 </p>
 <p>
 After that they bent their course to the left in order to reach the
 plateau of Illy by the road that crosses the wood of la Garenne, but here
 again they were delayed; twenty times they nearly abandoned all hope of
 getting through the wood, so numerous were the obstacles they encountered.
 At every step their way was barred by huge trees that had been laid low by
 the artillery fire, stretched on the ground like mighty giants fallen. It
 was the part of the forest that had suffered so severely from the
 cannonade, where the projectiles had plowed their way through the secular
 growths as they might have done through a square of the Old Guard, meeting
 in either case with the sturdy resistance of veterans. Everywhere the
 earth was cumbered with gigantic trunks, stripped of their leaves and
 branches, pierced and mangled, even as mortals might have been, and this
 wholesale destruction, the sight of the poor limbs, maimed, slaughtered
 and weeping tears of sap, inspired the beholder with the sickening horror
 of a human battlefield. There were corpses of men there, too; soldiers,
 who had stood fraternally by the trees and fallen with them. A lieutenant,
 from whose mouth exuded a bloody froth, had been tearing up the grass by
 handfuls in his agony, and his stiffened fingers were still buried in the
 ground. A little farther on a captain, prone on his stomach, had raised
 his head to vent his anguish in yells and screams, and death had caught
 and fixed him in that strange attitude. Others seemed to be slumbering
 among the herbage, while a zouave; whose blue sash had taken fire, had had
 his hair and beard burned completely from his head. And several times it
 happened, as they traversed those woodland glades, that they had to remove
 a body from the path before the donkey could proceed on his way. Presently
 they came to a little valley, where the sights of horror abruptly ended.
 The battle had evidently turned at this point and expended its force in
 another direction, leaving this peaceful nook of nature untouched. The
 trees were all uninjured; the carpet of velvety moss was undefiled by
 blood. A little brook coursed merrily among the duckweed, the path that
 ran along its bank was shaded by tall beeches. A penetrating charm, a
 tender peacefulness pervaded the solitude of the lovely spot, where the
 living waters gave up their coolness to the air and the leaves whispered
 softly in the silence.
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper had stopped to let the donkey drink from the stream.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, how pleasant it is here!" he involuntarily exclaimed in his delight.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine cast an astonished look about her, as if wondering how it was that
 she, too, could feel the influence of the peaceful scene. Why should there
 be repose and happiness in that hidden nook, when surrounding it on every
 side were sorrow and affliction? She made a gesture of impatience.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Quick, quick, let us be gone. Where is the spot? Where did you tell me
 you saw Honore?"
 </p>
 <p>
 And when, at some fifty paces from there, they at last came out on the
 plateau of Illy, the level plain unrolled itself in its full extent before
 their vision. It was the real, the true battlefield that they beheld now,
 the bare fields stretching away to the horizon under the wan, cheerless
 sky, whence showers were streaming down continually. There were no piles
 of dead visible; all the Prussians must have been buried by this time, for
 there was not a single one to be seen among the corpses of the French that
 were scattered here and there, along the roads and in the fields, as the
 conflict had swayed in one direction or another. The first that they
 encountered was a sergeant, propped against a hedge, a superb man, in the
 bloom of his youthful vigor; his face was tranquil and a smile seemed to
 rest on his parted lips. A hundred paces further on, however, they beheld
 another, lying across the road, who had been mutilated most frightfully,
 his head almost entirely shot away, his shoulders covered with great
 splotches of brain matter. Then, as they advanced further into the field,
 after the single bodies, distributed here and there, they came across
 little groups; they saw seven men aligned in single rank, kneeling and
 with their muskets at the shoulder in the position of aim, who had been
 hit as they were about to fire, while close beside them a subaltern had
 also fallen as he was in the act of giving the word of command. After that
 the road led along the brink of a little ravine, and there they beheld a
 spectacle that aroused their horror to the highest pitch as they looked
 down into the chasm, into which an entire company seemed to have been
 blown by the fiery blast; it was choked with corpses, a landslide, an
 avalanche of maimed and mutilated men, bent and twisted in an inextricable
 tangle, who with convulsed fingers had caught at the yellow clay of the
 bank to save themselves in their descent, fruitlessly. And a dusky flock
 of ravens flew away, croaking noisily, and swarms of flies, thousands upon
 thousands of them, attracted by the odor of fresh blood, were buzzing over
 the bodies and returning incessantly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Where is the spot?" Silvine asked again.
 </p>
 <p>
 They were then passing a plowed field that was completely covered with
 knapsacks. It was manifest that some regiment had been roughly handled
 there, and the men, in a moment of panic, had relieved themselves of their
 burdens. The debris of every sort with which the ground was thickly strewn
 served to explain the episodes of the conflict. There was a stubble field
 where the scattered <i>kepis</i>, resembling huge poppies, shreds of
 uniforms, epaulettes, and sword-belts told the story of one of those
 infrequent hand-to-hand contests in the fierce artillery duel that had
 lasted twelve hours. But the objects that were encountered most
 frequently, at every step, in fact, were abandoned weapons, sabers,
 bayonets, and, more particularly, chassepots; and so numerous were they
 that they seemed to have sprouted from the earth, a harvest that had
 matured in a single ill-omened day. Porringers and buckets, also, were
 scattered along the roads, together with the heterogeneous contents of
 knapsacks, rice, brushes, clothing, cartridges. The fields everywhere
 presented an uniform scene of devastation: fences destroyed, trees
 blighted as if they had been struck by lightning, the very soil itself
 torn by shells, compacted and hardened by the tramp of countless feet, and
 so maltreated that it seemed as if seasons must elapse before it could
 again become productive. Everything had been drenched and soaked by the
 rain of the preceding day; an odor arose and hung in the air persistently,
 that odor of the battlefield that smells like fermenting straw and burning
 cloth, a mixture of rottenness and gunpowder.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, who was beginning to weary of those fields of death over which
 she had tramped so many long miles, looked about her with increasing
 distrust and uneasiness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Where is the spot? where is it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Prosper made no answer; he also was becoming uneasy. What distressed
 him even more than the sights of suffering among his fellow-soldiers was
 the dead horses, the poor brutes that lay outstretched upon their side,
 that were met with in great numbers. Many of them presented a most pitiful
 spectacle, in all sorts of harrowing attitudes, with heads torn from the
 body, with lacerated flanks from which the entrails protruded. Many were
 resting on their back, with their four feet elevated in the air like
 signals of distress. The entire extent of the broad plain was dotted with
 them. There were some that death had not released after their two days'
 agony; at the faintest sound they would raise their head, turning it
 eagerly from right to left, then let it fall again upon the ground, while
 others lay motionless and momentarily gave utterance to that shrill scream
 which one who has heard it can never forget, the lament of the dying
 horse, so piercingly mournful that earth and heaven seemed to shudder in
 unison with it. And Prosper, with a bleeding heart, thought of poor
 Zephyr, and told himself that perhaps he might see him once again.
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly he became aware that the ground was trembling under the
 thundering hoof-beats of a headlong charge. He turned to look, and had
 barely time to shout to his companion:
 </p>
 <p>
 "The horses, the horses! Get behind that wall!"
 </p>
 <p>
 From the summit of a neighboring eminence a hundred riderless horses, some
 of them still bearing the saddle and master's kit, were plunging down upon
 them at break-neck speed. They were cavalry mounts that had lost their
 masters and remained on the battlefield, and instinct had counseled them
 to associate together in a band. They had had neither hay nor oats for two
 days, and had cropped the scanty grass from off the plain, shorn the
 hedge-rows of leaves and twigs, gnawed the bark from the trees, and when
 they felt the pangs of hunger pricking at their vitals like a keen spur,
 they started all together at a mad gallop and charged across the deserted,
 silent fields, crushing the dead out of all human shape, extinguishing the
 last spark of life in the wounded.
 </p>
 <p>
 The band came on like a whirlwind; Silvine had only time to pull the
 donkey and cart to one side where they would be protected by the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> we shall be killed!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But the horses had taken the obstacle in their stride and were already
 scouring away in the distance on the other side with a rumble like that of
 a receding thunder-storm; striking into a sunken road they pursued it as
 far as the corner of a little wood, behind which they were lost to sight.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, when she had brought the cart back into the road, insisted that
 Prosper should answer her question before they proceeded further.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, where is it? You told me you could find the spot with your eyes
 bandaged; where is it? We have reached the ground."
 </p>
 <p>
 He, drawing himself up and anxiously scanning the horizon in every
 direction, seemed to become more and more perplexed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There were three trees, I must find those three trees in the first place.
 Ah, <i>dame</i>! see here, one's sight is not of the clearest when he is
 fighting, and it is no such easy matter to remember afterward the roads
 one has passed over!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then perceiving people to his left, two men and a woman, it occurred to
 him to question them, but the woman ran away at his approach and the men
 repulsed him with threatening gestures; and he saw others of the same
 stripe, clad in sordid rags, unspeakably filthy, with the ill-favored
 faces of thieves and murderers, and they all shunned him, slinking away
 among the corpses like jackals or other unclean, creeping beasts. Then he
 noticed that wherever these villainous gentry passed the dead behind them
 were shoeless, their bare, white feet exposed, devoid of covering, and he
 saw how it was: they were the tramps and thugs who followed the German
 armies for the sake of plundering the dead, the detestable crew who
 followed in the wake of the invasion in order that they might reap their
 harvest from the field of blood. A tall, lean fellow arose in front of him
 and scurried away on a run, a sack slung across his shoulder, the watches
 and small coins, proceeds of his robberies, jingling in his pockets.
 </p>
 <p>
 A boy about fourteen or fifteen years old, however, allowed Prosper to
 approach him, and when the latter, seeing him to be French, rated him
 soundly, the boy spoke up in his defense. What, was it wrong for a poor
 fellow to earn his living? He was collecting chassepots, and received five
 sous for every chassepot he brought in. He had run away from his village
 that morning, having eaten nothing since the day before, and engaged
 himself to a contractor from Luxembourg, who had an arrangement with the
 Prussians by virtue of which he was to gather the muskets from the field
 of battle, the Germans fearing that should the scattered arms be collected
 by the peasants of the frontier, they might be conveyed into Belgium and
 thence find their way back to France. And so it was that there was quite a
 flock of poor devils hunting for muskets and earning their five sous,
 rummaging among the herbage, like the women who may be seen in the
 meadows, bent nearly double, gathering dandelions.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's a dirty business," Prosper growled.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What would you have! A chap must eat," the boy replied. "I am not robbing
 anyone."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, as he did not belong to that neighborhood and could not give the
 information that Prosper wanted, he pointed out a little farmhouse not far
 away where he had seen some people stirring.
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper thanked him and was moving away to rejoin Silvine when he caught
 sight of a chassepot, partially buried in a furrow. His first thought was
 to say nothing of his discovery; then he turned about suddenly and
 shouted, as if he could not help it:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo! here's one; that will make five sous more for you."
 </p>
 <p>
 As they approached the farmhouse Silvine noticed other peasants engaged
 with spades and picks in digging long trenches; but these men were under
 the direct command of Prussian officers, who, with nothing more formidable
 than a light walking-stick in their hands, stood by, stiff and silent, and
 superintended the work. They had requisitioned the inhabitants of all the
 villages of the vicinity in this manner, fearing that decomposition might
 be hastened, owing to the rainy weather. Two cart-loads of dead bodies
 were standing near, and a gang of men was unloading them, laying the
 corpses side by side in close contiguity to one another, not searching
 them, not even looking at their faces, while two men followed after,
 equipped with great shovels, and covered the row with a layer of earth, so
 thin that the ground had already begun to crack beneath the showers. The
 work was so badly and hastily done that before two weeks should have
 elapsed each of those fissures would be breathing forth pestilence.
 Silvine could not resist the impulse to pause at the brink of the trench
 and look at those pitiful corpses as they were brought forward, one after
 another. She was possessed by a horrible fear that in each fresh body the
 men brought from the cart she might recognize Honore. Was not that he,
 that poor wretch whose left eye had been destroyed? No! Perhaps that one
 with the fractured jaw was he? The one thing certain to her mind was that
 if she did not make haste to find him, wherever he might be on that
 boundless, indeterminate plateau, they would pick him up and bury him in a
 common grave with the others. She therefore hurried to rejoin Prosper, who
 had gone on to the farmhouse with the cart.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> how is it that you are not better informed? Where is the
 place? Ask the people, question them."
 </p>
 <p>
 There were none but Prussians at the farm, however, together with a woman
 servant and her child, just come in from the woods, where they had been
 near perishing of thirst and hunger. The scene was one of patriarchal
 simplicity and well-earned repose after the fatigues of the last few days.
 Some of the soldiers had hung their uniforms from a clothes-line and were
 giving them a thorough brushing, another was putting a patch on his
 trousers, with great neatness and dexterity, while the cook of the
 detachment had built a great fire in the middle of the courtyard on which
 the soup was boiling in a huge pot from which ascended a most appetizing
 odor of cabbage and bacon. There is no denying that the Prussians
 generally displayed great moderation toward the inhabitants of the country
 after the conquest, which was made the easier to them by the spirit of
 discipline that prevailed among the troops. These men might have been
 taken for peaceable citizens just come in from their daily avocations,
 smoking their long pipes. On a bench beside the door sat a stout,
 red-bearded man, who had taken up the servant's child, a little urchin
 five or six years old, and was dandling it and talking baby-talk to it in
 German, delighted to see the little one laugh at the harsh syllables which
 it could not understand.
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper, fearing there might be more trouble in store for them, had turned
 his back on the soldiers immediately on entering, but those Prussians were
 really good fellows; they smiled at the little donkey, and did not even
 trouble themselves to ask for a sight of the pass.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then ensued a wild, aimless scamper across the bosom of the great,
 sinister plain. The sun, now sinking rapidly toward the horizon, showed
 its face for a moment from between two clouds. Was night to descend and
 surprise them in the midst of that vast charnel-house? Another shower came
 down; the sun was obscured, the rain and mist formed an impenetrable
 barrier about them, so that the country around, roads, fields, trees, was
 shut out from their vision. Prosper knew not where they were; he was lost,
 and admitted it: his memory was all astray, he could recall nothing
 precise of the occurrences of that terrible day but one before. Behind
 them, his head lowered almost to the ground, the little donkey trotted
 along resignedly, dragging the cart, with his customary docility. First
 they took a northerly course, then they returned toward Sedan. They had
 lost their bearings and could not tell in which direction they were going;
 twice they noticed that they were passing localities that they had passed
 before and retraced their steps. They had doubtless been traveling in a
 circle, and there came a moment when in their exhaustion and despair they
 stopped at a place where three roads met, without courage to pursue their
 search further, the rain pelting down on them, lost and utterly miserable
 in the midst of a sea of mud.
 </p>
 <p>
 But they heard the sound of groans, and hastening to a lonely little house
 on their left, found there, in one of the bedrooms, two wounded men. All
 the doors were standing open; the two unfortunates had succeeded in
 dragging themselves thus far and had thrown themselves on the beds, and
 for the two days that they had been alternately shivering and burning,
 their wounds having received no attention, they had seen no one, not a
 living soul. They were tortured by a consuming thirst, and the beating of
 the rain against the window-panes added to their torment, but they could
 not move hand or foot. Hence, when they heard Silvine approaching, the
 first word that escaped their lips was: "Drink! Give us to drink!" that
 longing, pathetic cry, with which the wounded always pursue the by-passer
 whenever the sound of footsteps arouses them from their lethargy. There
 were many cases similar to this, where men were overlooked in remote
 corners, whither they had fled for refuge. Some were picked up even five
 and six days later, when their sores were filled with maggots and their
 sufferings had rendered them delirious.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Silvine had given the wretched men a drink Prosper, who, in the more
 sorely injured of the twain, had recognized a comrade of his regiment, a
 chasseur d'Afrique, saw that they could not be far from the ground over
 which Margueritte's division had charged, inasmuch as the poor devil had
 been able to drag himself to that house. All the information he could get
 from him, however, was of the vaguest; yes, it was over that way; you
 turned to the left, after passing a big field of potatoes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Immediately she was in possession of this slender clue Silvine insisted on
 starting out again. An inferior officer of the medical department chanced
 to pass with a cart just then, collecting the dead; she hailed him and
 notified him of the presence of the wounded men, then, throwing the
 donkey's bridle across her arm, urged him along over the muddy road, eager
 to reach the designated spot, beyond the big potato field. When they had
 gone some distance she stopped, yielding to her despair.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God, where is the place! Where can it be?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper looked about him, taxing his recollection fruitlessly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I told you, it is close beside the place where we made our charge. If
 only I could find my poor Zephyr&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he cast a wistful look on the dead horses that lay around them. It had
 been his secret hope, his dearest wish, during the entire time they had
 been wandering over the plateau, to see his mount once more, to bid him a
 last farewell.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It ought to be somewhere in this vicinity," he suddenly said. "See! over
 there to the left, there are the three trees. You see the wheel-tracks?
 And, look, over yonder is a broken-down caisson. We have found the spot;
 we are here at last!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Quivering with emotion, Silvine darted forward and eagerly scanned the
 faces of two corpses, two artillerymen who had fallen by the roadside.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He is not here! He is not here! You cannot have seen aright. Yes, that is
 it; some delusion must have cheated your eyes." And little by little an
 air-drawn hope, a wild delight crept into her mind. "If you were mistaken,
 if he should be alive! And be sure he is alive, since he is not here!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly she gave utterance to a low, smothered cry. She had turned, and
 was standing on the very position that the battery had occupied. The scene
 was most frightful, the ground torn and fissured as by an earthquake and
 covered with wreckage of every description, the dead lying as they had
 fallen in every imaginable attitude of horror, arms bent and twisted, legs
 doubled under them, heads thrown back, the lips parted over the white
 teeth as if their last breath had been expended in shouting defiance to
 the foe. A corporal had died with his hands pressed convulsively to his
 eyes, unable longer to endure the dread spectacle. Some gold coins that a
 lieutenant carried in a belt about his body had been spilled at the same
 time as his life-blood, and lay scattered among his entrails. There were
 Adolphe, the driver, and the gunner, Louis, clasped in each other's arms
 in a fierce embrace, their sightless orbs starting from their sockets,
 mated even in death. And there, at last, was Honore, recumbent on his
 disabled gun as on a bed of honor, with the great rent in his side that
 had let out his young life, his face, unmutilated and beautiful in its
 stern anger, still turned defiantly toward the Prussian batteries.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! my friend," sobbed Silvine, "my friend, my friend&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had fallen to her knees on the damp, cold ground, her hands joined as
 if in prayer, in an outburst of frantic grief. The word friend, the only
 name by which it occurred to her to address him, told the story of the
 tender affection she had lost in that man, so good, so loving, who had
 forgiven her, had meant to make her his wife, despite the ugly past. And
 now all hope was dead within her bosom, there was nothing left to make
 life desirable. She had never loved another; she would put away her love
 for him at the bottom of her heart and hold it sacred there. The rain had
 ceased; a flock of crows that circled above the three trees, croaking
 dismally, affected her like a menace of evil. Was he to be taken from her
 again, her cherished dead, whom she had recovered with such difficulty?
 She dragged herself along upon her knees, and with a trembling hand
 brushed away the hungry flies that were buzzing about her friend's
 wide-open eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 She caught sight of a bit of blood-stained paper between Honore's
 stiffened fingers. It troubled her; she tried to gain possession of the
 paper, pulling at it gently, but the dead man would not surrender it,
 seemingly tightening his hold on it, guarding it so jealously that it
 could not have been taken from him without tearing it in bits. It was the
 letter she had written him, that he had always carried next his heart, and
 that he had taken from its hiding place in the moment of his supreme
 agony, as if to bid her a last farewell. It seemed so strange, was such a
 revelation, that he should have died thinking of her; when she saw what it
 was a profound delight filled her soul in the midst of her affliction.
 Yes, surely, she would leave it with him, the letter that was so dear to
 him! she would not take it from him, since he was so bent on carrying it
 with him to the grave. Her tears flowed afresh, but they were beneficent
 tears this time, and brought healing and comfort with them. She arose and
 kissed his hands, kissed him on the forehead, uttering meanwhile but that
 one word, which was in itself a prolonged caress:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My friend! my friend&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Meantime the sun was declining; Prosper had gone and taken the counterpane
 from the cart, and between them they raised Honore's body, slowly,
 reverently, and laid it on the bed-covering, which they had stretched upon
 the ground; then, first wrapping him in its folds, they bore him to the
 cart. It was threatening to rain again, and they had started on their
 return, forming, with the donkey, a sorrowful little cortege on the broad
 bosom of the accursed plain, when a deep rumbling as of thunder was heard
 in the distance. Prosper turned his head and had only time to shout:
 </p>
 <p>
 "The horses! the horses!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was the starving, abandoned cavalry mounts making another charge. They
 came up this time in a deep mass across a wide, smooth field, manes and
 tails streaming in the wind, froth flying from their nostrils, and the
 level rays of the fiery setting sun sent the shadow of the infuriated herd
 clean across the plateau. Silvine rushed forward and planted herself
 before the cart, raising her arms above her head as if her puny form might
 have power to check them. Fortunately the ground fell off just at that
 point, causing them to swerve to the left; otherwise they would have
 crushed donkey, cart, and all to powder. The earth trembled, and their
 hoofs sent a volley of clods and small stones flying through the air, one
 of which struck the donkey on the head and wounded him. The last that was
 seen of them they were tearing down a ravine.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's hunger that starts them off like that," said Prosper. "Poor beasts!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, having bandaged the donkey's ear with her handkerchief, took him
 again by the bridle, and the mournful little procession began to retrace
 its steps across the plateau, to cover the two leagues that lay between it
 and Remilly. Prosper had turned and cast a look on the dead horses, his
 heart heavy within him to leave the field without having seen Zephyr.
 </p>
 <p>
 A little below the wood of la Garenne, as they were about to turn off to
 the left to take the road that they had traversed that morning, they
 encountered another German post and were again obliged to exhibit their
 pass. And the officer in command, instead of telling them to avoid Sedan,
 ordered them to keep straight on their course and pass through the city;
 otherwise they would be arrested. This was the most recent order; it was
 not for them to question it. Moreover, their journey would be shortened by
 a mile and a quarter, which they did not regret, weary and foot-sore as
 they were.
 </p>
 <p>
 When they were within Sedan, however, they found their progress retarded
 owing to a singular cause. As soon as they had passed the fortifications
 their nostrils were saluted by such a stench, they were obliged to wade
 through such a mass of abominable filth, reaching almost to their knees,
 as fairly turned their stomachs. The city, where for three days a hundred
 thousand men had lived without the slightest provision being made for
 decency or cleanliness, had become a cesspool, a foul sewer, and this
 devil's broth was thickened by all sorts of solid matter, rotting hay and
 straw, stable litter, and the excreta of animals. The carcasses of the
 horses, too, that were knocked on the head, skinned, and cut up in the
 public squares, in full view of everyone, had their full share in
 contaminating the atmosphere; the entrails lay decaying in the hot
 sunshine, the bones and heads were left lying on the pavement, where they
 attracted swarms of flies. Pestilence would surely break out in the city
 unless they made haste to rid themselves of all that carrion, of that
 stratum of impurity, which, in the Rue de Minil, the Rue Maqua, and even
 on the Place Turenne, reached a depth of twelve inches. The Prussian
 authorities had taken the matter up, and their placards were to be seen
 posted about the city, requisitioning the inhabitants, irrespective of
 rank, laborers, merchants, bourgeois, magistrates, for the morrow; they
 were ordered to assemble, armed with brooms and shovels, and apply
 themselves to the task, and were warned that they would be subjected to
 heavy penalties if the city was not clean by night. The President of the
 Tribunal had taken time by the forelock, and might even then be seen
 scraping away at the pavement before his door and loading the results of
 his labors upon a wheelbarrow with a fire-shovel.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine and Prosper, who had selected the Grande Rue as their route for
 traversing the city, advanced but slowly through that lake of malodorous
 slime. In addition to that the place was in a state of ferment and
 agitation that made it necessary for them to pull up almost at every
 moment. It was the time that the Prussians had selected for searching the
 houses in order to unearth those soldiers, who, determined that they would
 not give themselves up, had hidden themselves away. When, at about two
 o'clock of the preceding day, General de Wimpffen had returned from the
 chateau of Bellevue after signing the capitulation, the report immediately
 began to circulate that the surrendered troops were to be held under guard
 in the peninsula of Iges until such time as arrangements could be
 perfected for sending them off to Germany. Some few officers had expressed
 their intention of taking advantage of that stipulation which accorded
 them their liberty conditionally on their signing an agreement not to
 serve again during the campaign. Only one general, so it was said,
 Bourgain-Desfeuilles, alleging his rheumatism as a reason, had bound
 himself by that pledge, and when, that very morning, his carriage had
 driven up to the door of the Hotel of the Golden Cross and he had taken
 his seat in it to leave the city, the people had hooted and hissed him
 unmercifully. The operation of disarming had been going on since break of
 day; the manner of its performance was, the troops defiled by battalions
 on the Place Turenne, where each man deposited his musket and bayonet on
 the pile, like a mountain of old iron, which kept rising higher and
 higher, in a corner of the place. There was a Prussian detachment there
 under the command of a young officer, a tall, pale youth, wearing a
 sky-blue tunic and a cap adorned with a cock's feather, who superintended
 operations with a lofty but soldier-like air, his hands encased in white
 gloves. A zouave, in a fit of insubordination, having refused to give up
 his chassepot, the officer ordered that he be taken away, adding, in the
 same even tone of voice: "And let him be shot forthwith!" The rest of the
 battalion continued to defile with a sullen and dejected air, throwing
 down their arms mechanically, as if in haste to have the ceremony ended.
 But who could estimate the number of those who had disarmed themselves
 voluntarily, those whose muskets lay scattered over the country, out
 yonder on the field of battle? And how many, too, within the last
 twenty-four hours had concealed themselves, flattering themselves with the
 hope that they might escape in the confusion that reigned everywhere!
 There was scarcely a house but had its crew of those headstrong idiots who
 refused to respond when called on, hiding away in corners and shamming
 death; the German patrols that were sent through the city even discovered
 them stowed away under beds. And as many, even after they were unearthed,
 stubbornly persisted in remaining in the cellars whither they had fled for
 shelter, the patrols were obliged to fire on them through the coal-holes.
 It was a man-hunt, a brutal and cruel battue, during which the city
 resounded with rifle-shots and outlandish oaths.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the Pont du Meuse they found a throng which the donkey was unable to
 penetrate and were brought to a stand-still. The officer commanding the
 guard at the bridge, suspecting they were endeavoring to carry on an
 illicit traffic in bread or meat, insisted on seeing with his own eyes
 what was contained in the cart; drawing aside the covering, he gazed for
 an instant on the corpse with a feeling expression, then motioned them to
 go their way. Still, however, they were unable to get forward, the crowd
 momentarily grew denser and denser; one of the first detachments of French
 prisoners was being conducted to the peninsula of Iges under escort of a
 Prussian guard. The sorry band streamed on in long array, the men in their
 tattered, dirty uniforms crowding one another, treading on one another's
 heels, with bowed heads and sidelong, hang-dog looks, the dejected gait
 and bearing of the vanquished to whom had been left not even so much as a
 knife with which to cut their throat. The harsh, curt orders of the guard
 urging them forward resounded like the cracking of a whip in the silence,
 which was unbroken save for the plashing of their coarse shoes through the
 semi-liquid mud. Another shower began to fall, and there could be no more
 sorrowful sight than that band of disheartened soldiers, shuffling along
 through the rain, like beggars and vagabonds on the public highway.
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once Prosper, whose heart was beating as if it would burst his
 bosom with repressed sorrow and indignation, nudged Silvine and called her
 attention to two soldiers who were passing at the moment. He had
 recognized Maurice and Jean, trudging along with their companions, like
 brothers, side by side. They were near the end of the line, and as there
 was now no impediment in their way, he was enabled to keep them in view as
 far as the Faubourg of Torcy, as they traversed the level road which leads
 to Iges between gardens and truck farms.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" murmured Silvine, distressed by what she had just seen, fixing her
 eyes on Honore's body, "it may be that the dead have the better part!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Night descended while they were at Wadelincourt, and it was pitchy dark
 long before they reached Remilly. Father Fouchard was greatly surprised to
 behold the body of his son, for he had felt certain that it would never be
 recovered. He had been attending to business during the day, and had
 completed an excellent bargain; the market price for officers' chargers
 was twenty francs, and he had bought three for forty-five francs.

 II.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The crush was so great as the column of prisoners was leaving Torcy that
 Maurice, who had stopped a moment to buy some tobacco, was parted from
 Jean, and with all his efforts was unable thereafter to catch up with his
 regiment through the dense masses of men that filled the road. When he at
 last reached the bridge that spans the canal which intersects the
 peninsula of Iges at its base, he found himself in a mixed company of
 chasseurs d'Afrique and troops of the infanterie de marine.
 </p>
 <p>
 There were two pieces of artillery stationed at the bridge, their muzzles
 turned upon the interior of the peninsula; it was a place easy of access,
 but from which exit would seem to be attended with some difficulties.
 Immediately beyond the canal was a comfortable house, where the Prussians
 had established a post, commanded by a captain, upon which devolved the
 duty of receiving and guarding the prisoners. The formalities observed
 were not excessive; they merely counted the men, as if they had been
 sheep, as they came streaming in a huddle across the bridge, without
 troubling themselves overmuch about uniforms or organizations, after which
 the prisoners were free of the fields and at liberty to select their
 dwelling-place wherever chance and the road they were on might direct.
 </p>
 <p>
 The first thing that Maurice did was to address a question to a Bavarian
 officer, who was seated astride upon a chair, enjoying a tranquil smoke.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The 106th of the line, sir, can you tell me where I shall find it?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Either the officer was unlike most German officers and did not understand
 French, or thought it a good joke to mystify a poor devil of a soldier. He
 smiled and raised his hand, indicating by his motion that the other was to
 keep following the road he was pursuing.
 </p>
 <p>
 Although Maurice had spent a good part of his life in the neighborhood he
 had never before been on the peninsula; he proceeded to explore his new
 surroundings, as a mariner might do when cast by a tempest on the shore of
 a desolate island. He first skirted the Tour a Glaire, a very handsome
 country-place, whose small park, situated as it was on the bank of the
 Meuse, possessed a peculiarly attractive charm. After that the road ran
 parallel with the river, of which the sluggish current flowed on the right
 hand at the foot of high, steep banks. The way from there was a gradually
 ascending one, until it wound around the gentle eminence that occupied the
 central portion of the peninsula, and there were abandoned quarries there
 and excavations in the ground, in which a network of narrow paths had
 their termination. A little further on was a mill, seated on the border of
 the stream. Then the road curved and pursued a descending course until it
 entered the village of Iges, which was built on the hillside and connected
 by a ferry with the further shore, just opposite the rope-walk at
 Saint-Albert. Last of all came meadows and cultivated fields, a broad
 expanse of level, treeless country, around which the river swept in a
 wide, circling bend. In vain had Maurice scrutinized every inch of uneven
 ground on the hillside; all he could distinguish there was cavalry and
 artillery, preparing their quarters for the night. He made further
 inquiries, applying among others to a corporal of chasseurs d'Afrique, who
 could give him no information. The prospect for finding his regiment
 looked bad; night was coming down, and, leg-weary and disheartened, he
 seated himself for a moment on a stone by the wayside.
 </p>
 <p>
 As he sat there, abandoning himself to the sensation of loneliness and
 despair that crept over him, he beheld before him, across the Meuse, the
 accursed fields where he had fought the day but one before. Bitter
 memories rose to his mind, in the fading light of that day of gloom and
 rain, as he surveyed the saturated, miry expanse of country that rose from
 the river's bank and was lost on the horizon. The defile of Saint-Albert,
 the narrow road by which the Prussians had gained their rear, ran along
 the bend of the stream as far as the white cliffs of the quarries of
 Montimont. The summits of the trees in the wood of la Falizette rose in
 rounded, fleecy masses over the rising ground of Seugnon. Directly before
 his eyes, a little to the left, was Saint-Menges, the road from which
 descended by a gentle slope and ended at the ferry; there, too, were the
 mamelon of Hattoy in the center, and Illy, in the far distance, in the
 background, and Fleigneux, almost hidden in its shallow vale, and Floing,
 less remote, on the right. He recognized the plateau where he had spent
 interminable hours among the cabbages, and the eminences that the reserve
 artillery had struggled so gallantly to hold, where he had seen Honore
 meet his death on his dismounted gun. And it was as if the baleful scene
 were again before him with all its abominations, steeping his mind in
 horror and disgust, until he was sick at heart.
 </p>
 <p>
 The reflection that soon it would be quite dark and it would not do to
 loiter there, however, caused him to resume his researches. He said to
 himself that perhaps the regiment was encamped somewhere beyond the
 village on the low ground, but the only ones he encountered there were
 some prowlers, and he decided to make the circuit of the peninsula,
 following the bend of the stream. As he was passing through a field of
 potatoes he was sufficiently thoughtful to dig a few of the tubers and put
 them in his pockets; they were not ripe, but he had nothing better, for
 Jean, as luck would have it, had insisted on carrying both the two loaves
 of bread that Delaherche had given them when they left his house. He was
 somewhat surprised at the number of horses he met with, roaming about the
 uncultivated lands, that fell off in an easy descent from the central
 elevation to the Meuse, in the direction of Donchery. Why should they have
 brought all those animals with them? how were they to be fed? And now it
 was night in earnest, and quite dark, when he came to a small piece of
 woods on the water's brink, in which he was surprised to find the
 cent-gardes of the Emperor's escort, providing for their creature comforts
 and drying themselves before roaring fires. These gentlemen, who had a
 separate encampment to themselves, had comfortable tents; their kettles
 were boiling merrily, there was a milch cow tied to a tree. It did not
 take Maurice long to see that he was not regarded with favor in that
 quarter, poor devil of an infantryman that he was, with his ragged,
 mud-stained uniform. They graciously accorded him permission to roast his
 potatoes in the ashes of their fires, however, and he withdrew to the
 shelter of a tree, some hundred yards away, to eat them. It was no longer
 raining; the sky was clear, the stars were shining brilliantly in the dark
 blue vault. He saw that he should have to spend the night in the open air
 and defer his researches until the morrow. He was so utterly used up that
 he could go no further; the trees would afford him some protection in case
 it came on to rain again.
 </p>
 <p>
 The strangeness of his situation, however, and the thought of his vast
 prison house, open to the winds of heaven, would not let him sleep. It had
 been an extremely clever move on the part of the Prussians to select that
 place of confinement for the eighty thousand men who constituted the
 remnant of the army of Chalons. The peninsula was approximately three
 miles long by one wide, affording abundant space for the broken fragments
 of the vanquished host, and Maurice could not fail to observe that it was
 surrounded on every side by water, the bend of the Meuse encircling it on
 the north, east and west, while on the south, at the base, connecting the
 two arms of the loop at the point where they drew together most closely,
 was the canal. Here alone was an outlet, the bridge, that was defended by
 two guns; wherefore it may be seen that the guarding of the camp was a
 comparatively easy task, notwithstanding its great extent. He had already
 taken note of the chain of sentries on the farther bank, a soldier being
 stationed by the waterside at every fifty paces, with orders to fire on
 any man who should attempt to escape by swimming. In the rear the
 different posts were connected by patrols of uhlans, while further in the
 distance, scattered over the broad fields, were the dark lines of the
 Prussian regiments; a threefold living, moving wall, immuring the captive
 army.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, in his sleeplessness, lay gazing with wide-open eyes into the
 blackness of the night, illuminated here and there by the smoldering
 watch-fires; the motionless forms of the sentinels were dimly visible
 beyond the pale ribbon of the Meuse. Erect they stood, duskier spots
 against the dusky shadows, beneath the faint light of the twinkling stars,
 and at regular intervals their guttural call came to his ears, a menacing
 watch-cry that was drowned in the hoarse murmur of the river in the
 distance. At sound of those unmelodious phrases in a foreign tongue,
 rising on the still air of a starlit night in the sunny land of France,
 the vision of the past again rose before him: all that he had beheld in
 memory an hour before, the plateau of Illy cumbered still with dead, the
 accursed country round about Sedan that had been the scene of such dire
 disaster; and resting on the ground in that cool, damp corner of a wood,
 his head pillowed on a root, he again yielded to the feeling of despair
 that had overwhelmed him the day before while lying on Delaherche's sofa.
 And that which, intensifying the suffering of his wounded pride, now
 harassed and tortured him, was the question of the morrow, the feverish
 longing to know how deep had been their fall, how great the wreck and ruin
 sustained by their world of yesterday. The Emperor had surrendered his
 sword to King William; was not, therefore, the abominable war ended? But
 he recalled the remark he had heard made by two of the Bavarians of the
 guard who had escorted the prisoners to Iges: "We're all in France, we're
 all bound for Paris!" In his semi-somnolent, dreamy state the vision of
 what was to be suddenly rose before his eyes: the empire overturned and
 swept away amid a howl of universal execration, the republic proclaimed
 with an outburst of patriotic fervor, while the legend of '92 would incite
 men to emulate the glorious past, and, flocking to the standards, drive
 from the country's soil the hated foreigner with armies of brave
 volunteers. He reflected confusedly upon all the aspects of the case, and
 speculations followed one another in swift succession through his poor
 wearied brain: the harsh terms imposed by the victors, the bitterness of
 defeat, the determination of the vanquished to resist even to the last
 drop of blood, the fate of those eighty thousand men, his companions, who
 were to be captives for weeks, months, years, perhaps, first on the
 peninsula and afterward in German fortresses. The foundations were giving
 way, and everything was going down, down to the bottomless depths of
 perdition.
 </p>
 <p>
 The call of the sentinels, now loud, now low, seemed to sound more faintly
 in his ears and to be receding in the distance, when suddenly, as he
 turned on his hard couch, a shot rent the deep silence. A hollow groan
 rose on the calm air of night, there was a splashing in the water, the
 brief struggle of one who sinks to rise no more. It was some poor wretch
 who had attempted to escape by swimming the Meuse and had received a
 bullet in his brain.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next morning Maurice was up and stirring with the sun. The sky was
 cloudless; he was desirous to rejoin Jean and his other comrades of the
 company with the least possible delay. For a moment he had an idea of
 going to see what there was in the interior of the peninsula, then
 resolved he would first complete its circuit. And on reaching the canal
 his eyes were greeted with the sight of the 106th&mdash;or rather what was
 left of it&mdash;a thousand men, encamped along the river bank among some
 waste lands, with no protection save a row of slender poplars. If he had
 only turned to the left the night before instead of pursuing a straight
 course he could have been with his regiment at once. And he noticed that
 almost all the line regiments were collected along that part of the bank
 that extends from the Tour a Glaire to the Chateau of Villette&mdash;another
 bourgeois country place, situated more in the direction of Donchery and
 surrounded by a few hovels&mdash;all of them having selected their bivouac
 near the bridge, sole issue from their prison, as sheep will instinctively
 huddle together close to the door of their fold, knowing that sooner or
 later it will be opened for them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean uttered a cry of pleasure. "Ah, so it's you, at last! I had begun to
 think you were in the river."
 </p>
 <p>
 He was there with what remained of the squad, Pache and Lapoulle, Loubet
 and Chouteau. The last named had slept under doorways in Sedan until the
 attention of the Prussian provost guard had finally restored them to their
 regiment. The corporal, moreover, was the only surviving officer of the
 company, death having taken away Sergeant Sapin, Lieutenant Rochas and
 Captain Beaudoin, and although the victors had abolished distinction of
 rank among the prisoners, deciding that obedience was due to the German
 officers alone, the four men had, nevertheless, rallied to him, knowing
 him to be a leader of prudence and experience, upon whom they could rely
 in circumstances of difficulty. Thus it was that peace and harmony reigned
 among them that morning, notwithstanding the stupidity of some and the
 evil designs of others. In the first place, the night before he had found
 them a place to sleep in that was comparatively dry, where they had
 stretched themselves on the ground, the only thing they had left in the
 way of protection from the weather being the half of a shelter-tent. After
 that he had managed to secure some wood and a kettle, in which Loubet made
 coffee for them, the comforting warmth of which had fortified their
 stomachs. The rain had ceased, the day gave promise of being bright and
 warm, they had a small supply of biscuit and bacon left, and then, as
 Chouteau said, it was a comfort to have no orders to obey, to have their
 fill of loafing. They were prisoners, it was true, but there was plenty of
 room to move about. Moreover, they would be away from there in two or
 three days. Under these circumstances the day, which was Sunday, the 4th,
 passed pleasantly enough.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, whose courage had returned to him now that he was with the
 comrades once more, found nothing to annoy him except the Prussian bands,
 which played all the afternoon beyond the canal. Toward evening there was
 vocal music, and the men sang in chorus. They could be seen outside the
 chain of sentries, walking to and fro in little groups and singing solemn
 melodies in a loud, ringing voice in honor of the Sabbath.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Confound those bands!" Maurice at last impatiently exclaimed. "They will
 drive me wild!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, whose nerves were less susceptible, shrugged his shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>! they have reason to feel good; and then perhaps they think
 it affords us pleasure. It hasn't been such a bad day; don't let's find
 fault."
 </p>
 <p>
 As night approached, however, the rain began to fall again. Some of the
 men had taken possession of what few unoccupied houses there were on the
 peninsula, others were provided with tents that they erected, but by far
 the greater number, without shelter of any sort, destitute of blankets
 even, were compelled to pass the night in the open air, exposed to the
 pouring rain.
 </p>
 <p>
 About one o'clock Maurice, who had been sleeping soundly as a result of
 his fatigue, awoke and found himself in the middle of a miniature lake.
 The trenches, swollen by the heavy downpour, had overflowed and inundated
 the ground where he lay. Chouteau's and Loubet's wrath vented itself in a
 volley of maledictions, while Pache shook Lapoulle, who, unmindful of his
 ducking, slept through it all as if he was never to wake again. Then Jean,
 remembering the row of poplars on the bank of the canal, collected his
 little band and ran thither for shelter; and there they passed the
 remainder of that wretched night, crouching with their backs to the trees,
 their legs doubled under them, so as to expose as little of their persons
 as might be to the big drops.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next day, and the day succeeding it, the weather was truly detestable,
 what with the continual showers, that came down so copiously and at such
 frequent intervals that the men's clothing had not time to dry on their
 backs. They were threatened with famine, too; there was not a biscuit left
 in camp, and the coffee and bacon were exhausted. During those two days,
 Monday and Tuesday, they existed on potatoes that they dug in the adjacent
 fields, and even those vegetables had become so scarce toward the end of
 the second day that those soldiers who had money paid as high as five sous
 apiece for them. It was true that the bugles sounded the call for
 "distribution"; the corporal had nearly run his legs off trying to be the
 first to reach a great shed near the Tour a Glaire, where it was reported
 that rations of bread were to be issued, but on the occasion of a first
 visit he had waited there three hours and gone away empty-handed, and on a
 second had become involved in a quarrel with a Bavarian. It was well known
 that the French officers were themselves in deep distress and powerless to
 assist their men; had the German staff driven the vanquished army out
 there in the mud and rain with the intention of letting them starve to
 death? Not the first step seemed to have been taken, not an effort had
 been made, to provide for the subsistence of those eighty thousand men in
 that hell on earth that the soldiers subsequently christened Camp Misery,
 a name that the bravest of them could never hear mentioned in later days
 without a shudder.
 </p>
 <p>
 On his return from his wearisome and fruitless expedition to the shed,
 Jean forgot his usual placidity and gave way to anger.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What do they mean by calling us up when there's nothing for us? I'll be
 hanged if I'll put myself out for them another time!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And yet, whenever there was a call, he hurried off again. It was inhuman
 to sound the bugles thus, merely because regulations prescribed certain
 calls at certain hours, and it had another effect that was near breaking
 Maurice's heart. Every time that the trumpets sounded the French horses,
 that were running free on the other side of the canal, came rushing up and
 dashed into the water to rejoin their squadron, as excited at the
 well-known sound as they would be at the touch of the spur; but in their
 exhausted condition they were swept away by the current and few attained
 the shore. It was a cruel sight to see their struggles; they were drowned
 in great numbers, and their bodies, decomposing and swelling in the hot
 sunshine, drifted on the bosom of the canal. As for those of them that got
 to land, they seemed as if stricken with sudden madness, galloping wildly
 off and hiding among the waste places of the peninsula.
 </p>
 <p>
 "More bones for the crows to pick!" sorrowfully said Maurice, remembering
 the great droves of horses that he had encountered on a previous occasion.
 "If we remain here a few days we shall all be devouring one another. Poor
 brutes!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The night between Tuesday and Wednesday was most terrible of all, and
 Jean, who was beginning to feel seriously alarmed for Maurice's feverish
 state, made him wrap himself in an old blanket that they had purchased
 from a zouave for ten francs, while he, with no protection save his
 water-soaked capote, cheerfully took the drenching of the deluge which
 that night pelted down without cessation. Their position under the poplars
 had become untenable; it was a streaming river of mud, the water rested in
 deep puddles on the surface of the saturated ground. What was worst of all
 was that they had to suffer on an empty stomach, the evening meal of the
 six men having consisted of two beets which they had been compelled to eat
 raw, having no dry wood to make a fire with, and the sweet taste and
 refreshing coolness of the vegetables had quickly been succeeded by an
 intolerable burning sensation. Some cases of dysentery had appeared among
 the men, caused by fatigue, improper food and the persistent humidity of
 the atmosphere. More than ten times that night did Jean stretch forth his
 hand to see that Maurice had not uncovered himself in the movements of his
 slumber, and thus he kept watch and ward over his friend&mdash;his back
 supported by the same tree-trunk, his legs in a pool of water&mdash;with
 tenderness unspeakable. Since the day that on the plateau of Illy his
 comrade had carried him off in his arms and saved him from the Prussians
 he had repaid the debt a hundred-fold. He stopped not to reason on it; it
 was the free gift of all his being, the total forgetfulness of self for
 love of the other, the finest, most delicate, grandest exhibition of
 friendship possible, and that, too, in a peasant, whose lot had always
 been the lowly one of a tiller of the soil and who had never risen far
 above the earth, who could not find words to express what he felt, acting
 purely from instinct, in all simplicity of soul. Many a time already he
 had taken the food from his mouth, as the men of the squad were wont to
 say; now he would have divested himself of his skin if with it he might
 have covered the other, to protect his shoulders, to warm his feet. And in
 the midst of the savage egoism that surrounded them, among that
 aggregation of suffering humanity whose worst appetites were inflamed and
 intensified by hunger, he perhaps owed it to his complete abnegation of
 self that he had preserved thus far his tranquillity of mind and his
 vigorous health, for he among them all, his great strength unimpaired,
 alone maintained his composure and something like a level head.
 </p>
 <p>
 After that distressful night Jean determined to carry into execution a
 plan that he had been reflecting over since the day previous.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, little one, we can get nothing to eat, and everyone seems to
 have forgotten us here in this beastly hole; now unless we want to die the
 death of dogs, it behooves us to stir about a bit. How are your legs?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The sun had come out again, fortunately, and Maurice was warmed and
 comforted.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, my legs are all right!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Then we'll start off on an exploring expedition. We've money in our
 pockets, and the deuce is in it if we can't find something to buy. And we
 won't bother our heads about the others; they don't deserve it. Let them
 take care of themselves."
 </p>
 <p>
 The truth was that Loubet and Chouteau had disgusted him by their
 trickiness and low selfishness, stealing whatever they could lay hands on
 and never dividing with their comrades, while no good was to be got out of
 Lapoulle, the brute, and Pache, the sniveling devotee.
 </p>
 <p>
 The pair, therefore, Maurice and Jean, started out by the road along the
 Meuse which the former had traversed once before, on the night of his
 arrival. At the Tour a Glaire the park and dwelling-house presented a
 sorrowful spectacle of pillage and devastation, the trim lawns cut up and
 destroyed, the trees felled, the mansion dismantled. A ragged, dirty crew
 of soldiers, with hollow cheeks and eyes preternaturally bright from
 fever, had taken possession of the place and were living like beasts in
 the filthy chambers, not daring to leave their quarters for a moment lest
 someone else might come along and occupy them. A little further on they
 passed the cavalry and artillery, encamped on the hillsides, once so
 conspicuous by reason of the neatness and jauntiness of their appearance,
 now run to seed like all the rest, their organization gone, demoralized by
 that terrible, torturing hunger that drove the horses wild and sent the
 men straggling through the fields in plundering bands. Below them, to the
 right, they beheld an apparently interminable line of artillerymen and
 chasseurs d'Afrique defiling slowly before the mill; the miller was
 selling them flour, measuring out two handfuls into their handkerchiefs
 for a franc. The prospect of the long wait that lay before them, should
 they take their place at the end of the line, determined them to pass on,
 in the hope that some better opportunity would present itself at the
 village of Iges; but great was their consternation when they reached it to
 find the little place as bare and empty as an Algerian village through
 which has passed a swarm of locusts; not a crumb, not a fragment of
 anything eatable, neither bread, nor meat, nor vegetables, the wretched
 inhabitants utterly destitute. General Lebrun was said to be there,
 closeted with the mayor. He had been endeavoring, ineffectually, to
 arrange for an issue of bonds, redeemable at the close of the war, in
 order to facilitate the victualing of the troops. Money had ceased to have
 any value when there was nothing that it could purchase. The day before
 two francs had been paid for a biscuit, seven francs for a bottle of wine,
 a small glass of brandy was twenty sous, a pipeful of tobacco ten sous.
 And now officers, sword in hand, had to stand guard before the general's
 house and the neighboring hovels, for bands of marauders were constantly
 passing, breaking down doors and stealing even the oil from the lamps and
 drinking it.
 </p>
 <p>
 Three zouaves invited Maurice and Jean to join them. Five would do the
 work more effectually than three.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come along. There are horses dying in plenty, and if we can but get some
 dry wood&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then they fell to work on the miserable cabin of a poor peasant, smashing
 the closet doors, tearing the thatch from the roof. Some officers, who
 came up on a run, threatened them with their revolvers and put them to
 flight.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, who saw that the few villagers who had remained at Iges were no
 better off than the soldiers, perceived he had made a mistake in passing
 the mill without buying some flour.
 </p>
 <p>
 "There may be some left; we had best go back."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice was so reduced from inanition and was beginning to suffer so
 from fatigue that he left him behind in a sheltered nook among the
 quarries, seated on a fragment of rock, his face turned upon the wide
 horizon of Sedan. He, after waiting in line for two long hours, finally
 returned with some flour wrapped in a piece of rag. And they ate it
 uncooked, dipping it up in their hands, unable to devise any other way. It
 was not so very bad; It had no particular flavor, only the insipid taste
 of dough. Their breakfast, such as it was, did them some good, however.
 They were even so fortunate as to discover a little pool of rain-water,
 comparatively pure, in a hollow of a rock, at which they quenched their
 thirst with great satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
 But when Jean proposed that they should spend the remainder of the
 afternoon there, Maurice negatived the motion with a great display of
 violence.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; not here! I should be ill if I were to have that scene before my
 eyes for any length of time&mdash;" With a hand that trembled he pointed
 to the remote horizon, the hill of Hattoy, the plateaux of Floing and
 Illy, the wood of la Garenne, those abhorred, detested fields of slaughter
 and defeat. "While you were away just now I was obliged to turn my back on
 it, else I should have broken out and howled with rage. Yes, I should have
 howled like a dog tormented by boys&mdash;you can't imagine how it hurts
 me; it drives me crazy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean looked at him in surprise; he could not understand that pride,
 sensitive as a raw sore, that made defeat so bitter to him; he was alarmed
 to behold in his eyes that wandering, flighty look that he had seen there
 before. He affected to treat the matter lightly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good! we'll seek another country; that's easy enough to do."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then they wandered as long as daylight lasted, wherever the paths they
 took conducted them. They visited the level portion of the peninsula in
 the hope of finding more potatoes there, but the artillerymen had obtained
 a plow and turned up the ground, and not a single potato had escaped their
 sharp eyes. They retraced their steps, and again they passed through
 throngs of listless, glassy-eyed, starving soldiers, strewing the ground
 with their debilitated forms, falling by hundreds in the bright sunshine
 from sheer exhaustion. They were themselves many times overcome by fatigue
 and forced to sit down and rest; then their deep-seated sensation of
 suffering would bring them to their feet again and they would recommence
 their wandering, like animals impelled by instinct to move on perpetually
 in quest of pasturage. It seemed to them to last for years, and yet the
 moments sped by rapidly. In the more inland region, over Donchery way,
 they received a fright from the horses and sought the protection of a
 wall, where they remained a long time, too exhausted to rise, watching
 with vague, lack-luster eyes the wild course of the crazed beasts as they
 raced athwart the red western sky where the sun was sinking.
 </p>
 <p>
 As Maurice had foreseen, the thousands of horses that shared the captivity
 of the army, and for which it was impossible to provide forage,
 constituted a peril that grew greater day by day. At first they had
 nibbled the vegetation and gnawed the bark off trees, then had attacked
 the fences and whatever wooden structures they came across, and now they
 seemed ready to devour one another. It was a frequent occurrence to see
 one of them throw himself upon another and tear out great tufts from his
 mane or tail, which he would grind between his teeth, slavering meanwhile
 at the mouth profusely. But it was at night that they became most
 terrible, as if they were visited by visions of terror in the darkness.
 They collected in droves, and, attracted by the straw, made furious rushes
 upon what few tents there were, overturning and demolishing them. It was
 to no purpose that the men built great fires to keep them away; the device
 only served to madden them the more. Their shrill cries were so full of
 anguish, so dreadful to the ear, that they might have been mistaken for
 the howls of wild beasts. Were they driven away, they returned, more
 numerous and fiercer than before. Scarce a moment passed but out in the
 darkness could be heard the shriek of anguish of some unfortunate soldier
 whom the crazed beasts had crushed in their wild stampede.
 </p>
 <p>
 The sun was still above the horizon when Jean and Maurice, on their way
 back to the camp, were astonished by meeting with the four men of the
 squad, lurking in a ditch, apparently for no good purpose. Loubet hailed
 them at once, and Chouteau constituted himself spokesman:
 </p>
 <p>
 "We are considering ways and means for dining this evening. We shall die
 if we go on this way; it is thirty-six hours since we have had anything to
 put in our stomach&mdash;so, as there are horses plenty, and horse-meat
 isn't such bad eating&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You'll join us, won't you, corporal?" said Loubet, interrupting, "for,
 with such a big, strong animal to handle, the more of us there are the
 better it will be. See, there is one, off yonder, that we've been keeping
 an eye on for the last hour; that big bay that is in such a bad way. He'll
 be all the easier to finish."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he pointed to a horse that was dying of starvation, on the edge of
 what had once been a field of beets. He had fallen on his flank, and every
 now and then would raise his head and look about him pleadingly, with a
 deep inhalation that sounded like a sigh.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, how long we have to wait!" grumbled Lapoulle, who was suffering
 torment from his fierce appetite. "I'll go and kill him&mdash;shall I?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Loubet stopped him. Much obliged! and have the Prussians down on them,
 who had given notice that death would be the penalty for killing a horse,
 fearing that the carcass would breed a pestilence. They must wait until it
 was dark. And that was the reason why the four men were lurking in the
 ditch, waiting, with glistening, hungry eyes fixed on the dying brute.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Corporal," asked Pache, in a voice that faltered a little, "you have lots
 of ideas in your head; couldn't you kill him painlessly?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean refused the cruel task with a gesture of disgust. What, kill that
 poor beast that was even then in its death agony! oh, no, no! His first
 impulse had been to fly and take Maurice with him, that neither of them
 might be concerned in the revolting butchery; but looking at his companion
 and beholding him so pale and faint, he reproached himself for such an
 excess of sensibility. What were animals created for after all, <i>mon
 Dieu</i>, unless to afford sustenance to man! They could not allow
 themselves to starve when there was food within reach. And it rejoiced him
 to see Maurice cheer up a little at the prospect of eating; he said in his
 easy, good-natured way:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Faith, you're wrong there; I've no ideas in my head, and if he has got to
 be killed without pain&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! that's all one to me," interrupted Lapoulle. "I'll show you."
 </p>
 <p>
 The two newcomers seated themselves in the ditch and joined the others in
 their expectancy. Now and again one of the men would rise and make certain
 that the horse was still there, its neck outstretched to catch the cool
 exhalations of the Meuse and the last rays of the setting sun, as if
 bidding farewell to life. And when at last twilight crept slowly o'er the
 scene the six men were erect upon their feet, impatient that night was so
 tardy in its coming, casting furtive, frightened looks about them to see
 they were not observed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>zut</i>!" exclaimed Chouteau, "the time is come!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Objects were still discernible in the fields by the uncertain, mysterious
 light "between dog and wolf," and Lapoulle went forward first, followed by
 the five others. He had taken from the ditch a large, rounded boulder,
 and, with it in his two brawny hands, rushing upon the horse, commenced to
 batter at his skull as with a club. At the second blow, however, the
 horse, stung by the pain, attempted to get on his feet. Chouteau and
 Loubet had thrown themselves across his legs and were endeavoring to hold
 him down, shouting to the others to help them. The poor brute's cries were
 almost human in their accent of terror and distress; he struggled
 desperately to shake off his assailants, and would have broken them like a
 reed had he not been half dead with inanition. The movements of his head
 prevented the blows from taking effect; Lapoulle was unable to despatch
 him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> how hard his bones are! Hold him, somebody, until I
 finish him."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean and Maurice stood looking at the scene in silent horror; they heard
 not Chouteau's appeals for assistance; were powerless to raise a hand. And
 Pache, in a sudden outburst of piety and pity, dropped on his knees,
 joined his hands, and began to mumble the prayers that are repeated at the
 bedside of the dying.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Merciful God, have pity on him. Let him, good Lord, depart in peace&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Again Lapoulle struck ineffectually, with no other effect than to destroy
 an ear of the wretched creature, that threw back its head and gave
 utterance to a loud, shrill scream.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hold on!" growled Chouteau; "this won't do; he'll get us all in the
 lockup. We must end the matter. Hold him fast, Loubet."
 </p>
 <p>
 He took from his pocket a penknife, a small affair of which the blade was
 scarcely longer than a man's finger, and casting himself prone on the
 animal's body and passing an arm about its neck, began to hack away at the
 live flesh, cutting away great morsels, until he found and severed the
 artery. He leaped quickly to one side; the blood spurted forth in a
 torrent, as when the plug is removed from a fountain, while the feet
 stirred feebly and convulsive movements ran along the skin, succeeding one
 another like waves of the sea. It was near five minutes before the horse
 was dead. His great eyes, dilated wide and filled with melancholy and
 affright, were fixed upon the wan-visaged men who stood waiting for him to
 die; then they grew dim and the light died from out them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Merciful God," muttered Pache, still on his knees, "keep him in thy holy
 protection&mdash;succor him, Lord, and grant him eternal rest."
 </p>
 <p>
 Afterward, when the creature's movements had ceased, they were at a loss
 to know where the best cut lay and how they were to get at it. Loubet, who
 was something of a Jack-of-all-trades, showed them what was to be done in
 order to secure the loin, but as he was a tyro at the butchering business
 and, moreover, had only his small penknife to work with, he quickly lost
 his way amid the warm, quivering flesh. And Lapoulle, in his impatience,
 having attempted to be of assistance by making an incision in the belly,
 for which there was no necessity whatever, the scene of bloodshed became
 truly sickening. They wallowed in the gore and entrails that covered the
 ground about them, like a pack of ravening wolves collected around the
 carcass of their prey, fleshing their keen fangs in it.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I don't know what cut that may be," Loubet said at last, rising to his
 feet with a huge lump of meat in his hands, "but by the time we've eaten
 it, I don't believe any of us will be hungry."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean and Maurice had averted their eyes in horror from the disgusting
 spectacle; still, however, the pangs of hunger were gnawing at their
 vitals, and when the band slunk rapidly away, so as not to be caught in
 the vicinity of the incriminating carcass, they followed it. Chouteau had
 discovered three large beets, that had somehow been overlooked by previous
 visitors to the field, and carried them off with him. Loubet had loaded
 the meat on Lapoulle's shoulders so as to have his own arms free, while
 Pache carried the kettle that belonged to the squad, which they had
 brought with them on the chance of finding something to cook in it. And
 the six men ran as if their lives were at stake, never stopping to take
 breath, as if they heard the pursuers at their heels.
 </p>
 <p>
 Suddenly Loubet brought the others to a halt.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's idiotic to run like this; let's decide where we shall go to cook the
 stuff."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, who was beginning to recover his self-possession, proposed the
 quarries. They were only three hundred yards distant, and in them were
 secret recesses in abundance where they could kindle a fire without being
 seen. When they reached the spot, however, difficulties of every
 description presented themselves. First, there was the question of wood;
 fortunately a laborer, who had been repairing the road, had gone home and
 left his wheelbarrow behind him; Lapoulle quickly reduced it to fragments
 with the heel of his boot. Then there was no water to be had that was fit
 to drink; the hot sunshine had dried up all the pools of rain-water. True
 there was a pump at the Tour a Glaire, but that was too far away, and
 besides it was never accessible before midnight; the men forming in long
 lines with their bowls and porringers, only too happy when, after waiting
 for hours, they could escape from the jam with their supply of the
 precious fluid unspilled. As for the few wells in the neighborhood, they
 had been dry for the last two days, and the bucket brought up nothing save
 mud and slime. Their sole resource appeared to be the water of the Meuse,
 which was parted from them by the road.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I'll take the kettle and go and fill it," said Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 The others objected.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no! We don't want to be poisoned; it is full of dead bodies!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They spoke the truth. The Meuse was constantly bringing down corpses of
 men and horses; they could be seen floating with the current at any moment
 of the day, swollen and of a greenish hue, in the early stages of
 decomposition. Often they were caught in the weeds and bushes on the bank,
 where they remained to poison the atmosphere, swinging to the tide with a
 gentle, tremulous motion that imparted to them a semblance of life. Nearly
 every soldier who had drunk that abominable water had suffered from nausea
 and colic, often succeeded afterward by dysentery. It seemed as if they
 must make up their mind to use it, however, as there was no other; Maurice
 explained that there would be no danger in drinking it after it was
 boiled.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well, then; I'll go," said Jean. And he started, taking Lapoulle
 with him to carry the kettle.
 </p>
 <p>
 By the time they got the kettle filled and on the fire it was quite dark.
 Loubet had peeled the beets and thrown them into the water to cook&mdash;a
 feast fit for the gods, he declared it would be&mdash;and fed the fire
 with fragments of the wheelbarrow, for they were all suffering so from
 hunger that they could have eaten the meat before the pot began to boil.
 Their huge shadows danced fantastically in the firelight on the rocky
 walls of the quarry. Then they found it impossible longer to restrain
 their appetite, and threw themselves upon the unclean mess, tearing the
 flesh with eager, trembling fingers and dividing it among them, too
 impatient even to make use of the knife. But, famishing as they were,
 their stomachs revolted; they felt the want of salt, they could not
 swallow that tasteless, sickening broth, those chunks of half-cooked,
 viscid meat that had a taste like clay. Some among them had a fit of
 vomiting. Pache was very ill. Chouteau and Loubet heaped maledictions on
 that infernal old nag, that had caused them such trouble to get him to the
 pot and then given them the colic. Lapoulle was the only one among them
 who ate abundantly, but he was in a very bad way that night when, with his
 three comrades, he returned to their resting-place under the poplars by
 the canal.
 </p>
 <p>
 On their way back to camp Maurice, without uttering a word, took advantage
 of the darkness to seize Jean by the arm and drag him into a by-path.
 Their comrades inspired him with unconquerable disgust; he thought he
 should like to go and sleep in the little wood where he had spent his
 first night on the peninsula. It was a good idea, and Jean commended it
 highly when he had laid himself down on the warm, dry ground, under the
 shelter of the dense foliage. They remained there until the sun was high
 in the heavens, and enjoyed a sound, refreshing slumber, which restored to
 them something of their strength.
 </p>
 <p>
 The following day was Thursday, but they had ceased to note the days; they
 were simply glad to observe that the weather seemed to be coming off fine
 again. Jean overcame Maurice's repugnance and prevailed on him to return
 to the canal, to see if their regiment was not to move that day. Not a day
 passed now but detachments of prisoners, a thousand to twelve hundred
 strong, were sent off to the fortresses in Germany. The day but one before
 they had seen, drawn up in front of the Prussian headquarters, a column of
 officers of various grades, who were going to Pont-a-Mousson, there to
 take the railway. Everyone was possessed with a wild, feverish longing to
 get away from that camp where they had seen such suffering. Ah! if it but
 might be their turn! And when they found the 106th still encamped on the
 bank of the canal, in the inevitable disorder consequent upon such
 distress, their courage failed them and they despaired.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean and Maurice that day thought they saw a prospect of obtaining
 something to eat. All the morning a lively traffic had been going on
 between the prisoners and the Bavarians on the other side of the canal;
 the former would wrap their money in a handkerchief and toss it across to
 the opposite shore, the latter would return the handkerchief with a loaf
 of coarse brown bread, or a plug of their common, damp tobacco. Even
 soldiers who had no money were not debarred from participating in this
 commerce, employing, instead of currency, their white uniform gloves, for
 which the Germans appeared to have a weakness. For two hours packages were
 flying across the canal in its entire length under this primitive system
 of exchanges. But when Maurice dispatched his cravat with a five-franc
 piece tied in it to the other bank, the Bavarian who was to return him a
 loaf of bread gave it, whether from awkwardness or malice, such an
 ineffectual toss that it fell in the water. The incident elicited shouts
 of laughter from the Germans. Twice again Maurice repeated the experiment,
 and twice his loaf went to feed the fishes. At last the Prussian officers,
 attracted by the uproar, came running up and prohibited their men from
 selling anything to the prisoners, threatening them with dire penalties
 and punishments in case of disobedience. The traffic came to a sudden end,
 and Jean had hard work to pacify Maurice, who shook his fists at the
 scamps, shouting to them to give him back his five-franc pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
 This was another terrible day, notwithstanding the warm, bright sunshine.
 Twice the bugle sounded and sent Jean hurrying off to the shed whence
 rations were supposed to be issued, but on each occasion he only got his
 toes trod on and his ribs racked in the crush. The Prussians, whose
 organization was so wonderfully complete, continued to manifest the same
 brutal inattention to the necessities of the vanquished army. On the
 representations of Generals Douay and Lebrun, they had indeed sent in a
 few sheep as well as some wagon-loads of bread, but so little care was
 taken to guard them that the sheep were carried off bodily and the wagons
 pillaged as soon as they reached the bridge, the consequence of which was
 that the troops who were encamped a hundred yards further on were no
 better off than before; it was only the worst element, the plunderers and
 bummers, who benefited by the provision trains. And thereon Jean, who, as
 he said, saw how the trick was done, brought Maurice with him to the
 bridge to keep an eye on the victuals.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was four o'clock, and they had not had a morsel to eat all that
 beautiful bright Thursday, when suddenly their eyes were gladdened by the
 sight of Delaherche. A few among the citizens of Sedan had with infinite
 difficulty obtained permission to visit the prisoners, to whom they
 carried provisions, and Maurice had on several occasions expressed his
 surprise at his failure to receive any tidings of his sister. As soon as
 they recognized Delaherche in the distance, carrying a large basket and
 with a loaf of bread under either arm, they darted forward fast as their
 legs could carry them, but even thus they were too late; a crowding,
 jostling mob closed in, and in the confusion the dazed manufacturer was
 relieved of his basket and one of his loaves, which vanished from his
 sight so expeditiously that he was never able to tell the manner of their
 disappearance.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my poor friends!" he stammered, utterly crestfallen in his
 bewilderment and stupefaction, he who but a moment before had come through
 the gate with a smile on his lips and an air of good-fellowship,
 magnanimously forgetting his superior advantages in his desire for
 popularity.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean had taken possession of the remaining loaf and saved it from the
 hungry crew, and while he and Maurice, seated by the roadside, were making
 great inroads in it, Delaherche opened his budget of news for their
 benefit. His wife, the Lord be praised! was very well, but he was greatly
 alarmed for the colonel, who had sunk into a condition of deep
 prostration, although his mother continued to bear him company from
 morning until night.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And my sister?" Maurice inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes! your sister; true. She insisted on coming with me; it was she
 who brought the two loaves of bread. She had to remain over yonder,
 though, on the other side of the canal; the sentries wouldn't let her pass
 the gate. You know the Prussians have strictly prohibited the presence of
 women in the peninsula."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then he spoke of Henriette, and of her fruitless attempts to see her
 brother and come to his assistance. Once in Sedan chance had brought her
 face to face with Cousin Gunther, the man who was captain in the Prussian
 Guards. He had passed her with his haughty, supercilious air, pretending
 not to recognize her. She, also, with a sensation of loathing, as if she
 were in the presence of one of her husband's murderers, had hurried on
 with quickened steps; then, with a sudden change of purpose for which she
 could not account, had turned back and told him all the manner of Weiss's
 death, in harsh accents of reproach. And he, thus learning how horribly a
 relative had met his fate, had taken the matter coolly; it was the fortune
 of war; the same thing might have happened to himself. His face, rendered
 stoically impassive by the discipline of the soldier, had barely betrayed
 the faintest evidence of interest. After that, when she informed him that
 her brother was a prisoner and besought him to use his influence to obtain
 for her an opportunity of seeing him, he had excused himself on the ground
 that he was powerless in the matter; the instructions were explicit and
 might not be disobeyed. He appeared to place the regimental orderly book
 on a par with the Bible. She left him with the clearly defined impression
 that he believed he was in the country for the sole purpose of sitting in
 judgment on the French people, with all the intolerance and arrogance of
 the hereditary enemy, swollen by his personal hatred for the nation whom
 it had devolved on him to chastise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And now," said Delaherche in conclusion, "you won't have to go to bed
 supperless to-night; you have had a little something to eat. The worst is
 that I am afraid I shall not be able to secure another pass."
 </p>
 <p>
 He asked them if there was anything he could do for them outside, and
 obligingly consented to take charge of some pencil-written letters
 confided to him by other soldiers, for the Bavarians had more than once
 been seen to laugh as they lighted their pipes with missives which they
 had promised to forward. Then, when Jean and Maurice had accompanied him
 to the gate, he exclaimed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look! over yonder, there's Henriette! Don't you see her waving her
 handkerchief?"
 </p>
 <p>
 True enough, among the crowd beyond the line of sentinels they
 distinguished a little, thin, pale face, a white dot that trembled in the
 sunshine. Both were deeply affected, and, with moist eyes, raising their
 hands above their head, answered her salutation by waving them frantically
 in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 The following day was Friday, and it was then that Maurice felt that his
 cup of horror was full to overflowing. After another night of tranquil
 slumber in the little wood he was so fortunate as to secure another meal,
 Jean having come across an old woman at the Chateau of Villette who was
 selling bread at ten francs the pound. But that day they witnessed a
 spectacle of which the horror remained imprinted on their minds for many
 weeks and months.
 </p>
 <p>
 The day before Chouteau had noticed that Pache had ceased complaining and
 was going about with a careless, satisfied air, as a man might do who had
 dined well. He immediately jumped at the conclusion that the sly fox must
 have a concealed treasure somewhere, the more so that he had seen him
 absent himself for near an hour that morning and come back with a smile
 lurking on his face and his mouth filled with unswallowed food. It must be
 that he had had a windfall, had probably joined some marauding party and
 laid in a stock of provisions. And Chouteau labored with Loubet and
 Lapoulle to stir up bad feeling against the comrade, with the latter more
 particularly. <i>Hein!</i> wasn't he a dirty dog, if he had something to
 eat, not to go snacks with the comrades! He ought to have a lesson that he
 would remember, for his selfishness.
 </p>
 <p>
 "To-night we'll keep a watch on him, don't you see. We'll learn whether he
 dares to stuff himself on the sly, when so many poor devils are starving
 all around him."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, that's the talk! we'll follow him," Lapoulle angrily declared.
 "We'll see about it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He doubled his fists; he was like a crazy man whenever the subject of
 eating was mentioned in his presence. His enormous appetite caused him to
 suffer more than the others; his torment at times was such that he had
 been known to stuff his mouth with grass. For more than thirty-six hours,
 since the night when they had supped on horseflesh and he had contracted a
 terrible dysentery in consequence, he had been without food, for he was so
 little able to look out for himself that, notwithstanding his bovine
 strength, whenever he joined the others in a marauding raid he never got
 his share of the booty. He would have been willing to give his blood for a
 pound of bread.
 </p>
 <p>
 As it was beginning to be dark Pache stealthily made his way to the Tour a
 Glaire and slipped into the park, while the three others cautiously
 followed him at a distance.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It won't do to let him suspect anything," said Chouteau. "Be on your
 guard in case he should look around."
 </p>
 <p>
 But when he had advanced another hundred paces Pache evidently had no idea
 there was anyone near, for he began to hurry forward at a swift gait, not
 so much as casting a look behind. They had no difficulty in tracking him
 to the adjacent quarries, where they fell on him as he was in the act of
 removing two great flat stones, to take from the cavity beneath part of a
 loaf of bread. It was the last of his store; he had enough left for one
 more meal.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You dirty, sniveling priest's whelp!" roared Lapoulle, "so that is why
 you sneak away from us! Give me that; it's my share!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Why should he give his bread? Weak and puny as he was, his slight form
 dilated with anger, while he clutched the loaf against his bosom with all
 the strength he could master. For he also was hungry.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let me alone. It's mine."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, at sight of Lapoulle's raised fist, he broke away and ran, sliding
 down the steep banks of the quarries, making his way across the bare
 fields in the direction of Donchery, the three others after him in hot
 pursuit. He gained on them, however, being lighter than they, and
 possessed by such overmastering fear, so determined to hold on to what was
 his property, that his speed seemed to rival the wind. He had already
 covered more than half a mile and was approaching the little wood on the
 margin of the stream when he encountered Jean and Maurice, who were on
 their way back to their resting-place for the night. He addressed them an
 appealing, distressful cry as he passed; while they, astounded by the wild
 hunt that went fleeting by, stood motionless at the edge of a field, and
 thus it was that they beheld the ensuing tragedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 As luck would have it, Pache tripped over a stone and fell. In an instant
 the others were on top of him&mdash;shouting, swearing, their passion
 roused to such a pitch of frenzy that they were like wolves that had run
 down their prey.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Give me that," yelled Lapoulle, "or by G-d I'll kill you!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he had raised his fist again when Chouteau, taking from his pocket the
 penknife with which he had slaughtered the horse and opening it, placed it
 in his hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here, take it! the knife!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Jean meantime had come hurrying up, desirous to prevent the mischief
 he saw brewing, losing his wits like the rest of them, indiscreetly
 speaking of putting them all in the guardhouse; whereon Loubet, with an
 ugly laugh, told him he must be a Prussian, since they had no longer any
 commanders, and the Prussians were the only ones who issued orders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" Lapoulle repeated, "will you give me that?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Despite the terror that blanched his cheeks Pache hugged the bread more
 closely to his bosom, with the obstinacy of the peasant who never cedes a
 jot or tittle of that which is his.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then in a second all was over; the brute drove the knife into the other's
 throat with such violence that the wretched man did not even utter a cry.
 His arms relaxed, the bread fell to the ground, into the pool of blood
 that had spurted from the wound.
 </p>
 <p>
 At sight of the imbecile, uncalled-for murder, Maurice, who had until then
 been a silent spectator of the scene, appeared as if stricken by a sudden
 fit of madness. He raved and gesticulated, shaking his fist in the face of
 the three men and calling them murderers, assassins, with a violence that
 shook his frame from head to foot. But Lapoulle seemed not even to hear
 him. Squatted on the ground beside the corpse, he was devouring the
 bloodstained bread, an expression of stupid ferocity on his face, with a
 loud grinding of his great jaws, while Chouteau and Loubet, seeing him
 thus terrible in the gratification of his wild-beast appetite, did not
 even dare claim their portion.
 </p>
 <p>
 By this time night had fallen, a pleasant night with a clear sky thick-set
 with stars, and Maurice and Jean, who had regained the shelter of their
 little wood, presently perceived Lapoulle wandering up and down the river
 bank. The two others had vanished, had doubtless returned to the
 encampment by the canal, their mind troubled by reason of the corpse they
 left behind them. He, on the other hand, seemed to dread going to rejoin
 the comrades. When he was more himself and his brutish, sluggish intellect
 showed him the full extent of his crime, he had evidently experienced a
 twinge of anguish that made motion a necessity, and not daring to return
 to the interior of the peninsula, where he would have to face the body of
 his victim, had sought the bank of the stream, where he was now tramping
 to and fro with uneven, faltering steps. What was going on within the
 recesses of that darkened mind that guided the actions of that creature,
 so degraded as to be scarce higher than the animal? Was it the awakening
 of remorse? or only the fear lest his crime might be discovered? He could
 not remain there; he paced his beat as a wild beast shambles up and down
 its cage, with a sudden and ever-increasing longing to fly, a longing that
 ached and pained like a physical hurt, from which he felt he should die,
 could he do nothing to satisfy it. Quick, quick, he must fly, must fly at
 once, from that prison where he had slain a fellow-being. And yet, the
 coward in him, it may be, gaining the supremacy, he threw himself on the
 ground, and for a long time lay crouched among the herbage.
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice said to Jean in his horror and disgust:
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, I cannot remain longer in this place; I tell you plainly I
 should go mad. I am surprised that the physical part of me holds out as it
 does; my bodily health is not so bad, but the mind is going; yes! it is
 going, I am certain of it. If you leave me another day in this hell I am
 lost. I beg you, let us go away, let us start at once!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went on to propound the wildest schemes for getting away. They
 would swim the Meuse, would cast themselves on the sentries and strangle
 them with a cord he had in his pocket, or would beat out their brains with
 rocks, or would buy them over with the money they had left and don their
 uniform to pass through the Prussian lines.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My dear boy, be silent!" Jean sadly answered; "it frightens me to hear
 you talk so wildly. Is there any reason in what you say, are any of your
 plans feasible? Wait; to-morrow we'll see about it. Be silent!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He, although his heart, no less than his friend's, was wrung by the
 horrors that surrounded them on every side, had preserved his mental
 balance amid the debilitating effects of famine, among the grisly visions
 of that existence than which none could approach more nearly the depth of
 human misery. And as his companion's frenzy continued to increase and he
 talked of casting himself into the Meuse, he was obliged to restrain him,
 even to the point of using violence, scolding and supplicating, tears
 standing in his eyes. Then suddenly he said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "See! look there!"
 </p>
 <p>
 A splash was heard coming from the river, and they saw it was Lapoulle,
 who had finally decided to attempt to escape by the stream, first removing
 his capote in order that it might not hinder his movements; and his white
 shirt made a spot of brightness that was distinctly visible upon the dusky
 bosom of the moving water. He was swimming up-stream with a leisurely
 movement, doubtless on the lookout for a place where he might land with
 safety, while on the opposite shore there was no difficulty in discerning
 the shadowy forms of the sentries, erect and motionless in the
 semi-obscurity. There came a sudden flash that tore the black veil of
 night, a report that went with bellowing echoes and spent itself among the
 rocks of Montimont. The water boiled and bubbled for an instant, as it
 does under the wild efforts of an unpracticed oarsman. And that was all;
 Lapoulle's body, the white spot on the dusky stream, floated away,
 lifeless, upon the tide.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next day, which was Saturday, Jean aroused Maurice as soon as it was
 day and they returned to the camp of the 106th, with the hope that they
 might move that day, but there were no orders; it seemed as though the
 regiment's existence were forgotten. Many of the troops had been sent
 away, the peninsula was being depopulated, and sickness was terribly
 prevalent among those who were left behind. For eight long days disease
 had been germinating in that hell on earth; the rains had ceased, but the
 blazing, scorching sunlight had only wrought a change of evils. The
 excessive heat completed the exhaustion of the men and gave to the
 numerous cases of dysentery an alarmingly epidemic character. The excreta
 of that army of sick poisoned the air with their noxious emanations. No
 one could approach the Meuse or the canal, owing to the overpowering
 stench that rose from the bodies of drowned soldiers and horses that lay
 festering among the weeds. And the horses, that dropped in the fields from
 inanition, were decomposing so rapidly and forming such a fruitful source
 of pestilence that the Prussians, commencing to be alarmed on their own
 account, had provided picks and shovels and forced the prisoners to bury
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 That day, however, was the last on which they suffered from famine. As
 their numbers were so greatly reduced and provisions kept pouring in from
 every quarter, they passed at a single bound from the extreme of
 destitution to the most abundant plenty. Bread, meat, and wine, even, were
 to be had without stint; eating went on from morning till night, until
 they were ready to drop. Darkness descended, and they were eating still;
 in some quarters the gorging was continued until the next morning. To many
 it proved fatal.
 </p>
 <p>
 That whole day Jean made it his sole business to keep watch over Maurice,
 who he saw was ripe for some rash action. He had been drinking; he spoke
 of his intention of cuffing a Prussian officer in order that he might be
 sent away. And at night Jean, having discovered an unoccupied corner in
 the cellar of one of the outbuildings at the Tour a Glaire, thought it
 advisable to go and sleep there with his companion, thinking that a good
 night's rest would do him good, but it turned out to be the worst night in
 all their experience, a night of terror during which neither of them
 closed an eye. The cellar was inhabited by other soldiers; lying in the
 same corner were two who were dying of dysentery, and as soon as it was
 fairly dark they commenced to relieve their sufferings by moans and
 inarticulate cries, a hideous death-rattle that went on uninterruptedly
 until morning. These sounds finally became so horrific there in the
 intense darkness, that the others who were resting there, wishing to
 sleep, allowed their anger to get the better of them and shouted to the
 dying men to be silent. They did not hear; the rattle went on, drowning
 all other sounds, while from without came the drunken clamor of those who
 were eating and drinking still, with insatiable appetite.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then commenced for Maurice a period of agony unspeakable. He would have
 fled from the awful sounds that brought the cold sweat of anguish in great
 drops to his brow, but when he arose and attempted to grope his way out he
 trod on the limbs of those extended there, and finally fell to the ground,
 a living man immured there in the darkness with the dying. He made no
 further effort to escape from this last trial. The entire frightful
 disaster arose before his mind, from the time of their departure from
 Rheims to the crushing defeat of Sedan. It seemed to him that in that
 night, in the inky blackness of that cellar, where the groans of two dying
 soldiers drove sleep from the eyelids of their comrades, the ordeal of the
 army of Chalons had reached its climax. At each of the stations of its
 passion the army of despair, the expiatory band, driven forward to the
 sacrifice, had spent its life-blood in atonement for the faults of others;
 and now, unhonored amid disaster, covered with contumely, it was enduring
 martyrdom in that cruel scourging, the severity of which it had done
 nothing to deserve. He felt it was too much; he was heartsick with rage
 and grief, hungering for justice, burning with a fierce desire to be
 avenged on destiny.
 </p>
 <p>
 When daylight appeared one of the soldiers was dead, the other was
 lingering on in protracted agony.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come along, little one," Jean gently said; "we'll go and get a breath of
 fresh air; it will do us good."
 </p>
 <p>
 But when the pair emerged into the pure, warm morning air and, pursuing
 the river bank, were near the village of Iges, Maurice grew flightier
 still, and extending his hand toward the vast expanse of sunlit
 battlefield, the plateau of Illy in front of them, Saint-Menges to the
 left, the wood of la Garenne to the right, he cried:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, I cannot, I cannot bear to look on it! The sight pierces my heart and
 drives me mad. Take me away, oh! take me away, at once, at once!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Sunday once more; the bells were pealing from the steeples of
 Sedan, while the music of a German military band floated on the air in the
 distance. There were still no orders for their regiment to move, and Jean,
 alarmed to see Maurice's deliriousness increasing, determined to attempt
 the execution of a plan that he had been maturing in his mind for the last
 twenty-four hours. On the road before the tents of the Prussians another
 regiment, the 5th of the line, was drawn up in readiness for departure.
 Great confusion prevailed in the column, and an officer, whose knowledge
 of the French language was imperfect, had been unable to complete the
 roster of the prisoners. Then the two friends, having first torn from
 their uniform coat the collar and buttons in order that the number might
 not betray their identity, quietly took their place in the ranks and soon
 had the satisfaction of crossing the bridge and leaving the chain of
 sentries behind them. The same idea must have presented itself to Loubet
 and Chouteau, for they caught sight of them somewhat further to the rear,
 peering anxiously about them with the guilty eyes of murderers.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, what comfort there was for them in that first blissful moment! Outside
 their prison the sunlight was brighter, the air more bracing; it was like
 a resurrection, a bright renewal of all their hopes. Whatever evil fortune
 might have in store for them, they dreaded it not; they snapped their
 fingers at it in their delight at having seen the last of the horrors of
 Camp Misery.

 <h2>
 III.
 </h2>
 <p>
 That morning Maurice and Jean listened for the last time to the gay,
 ringing notes of the French bugles, and now they were on their way to
 Pont-a-Mousson, marching in the ranks of the convoy of prisoners, which
 was guarded front and rear by platoons of Prussian infantry, while a file
 of men with fixed bayonets flanked the column on either side. Whenever
 they came to a German post they heard only the lugubrious, ear-piercing
 strains of the Prussian trumpets.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice was glad to observe that the column took the left-hand road and
 would pass through Sedan; perhaps he would have an opportunity of seeing
 his sister Henriette. All the pleasure, however, that he had experienced
 at his release from that foul cesspool where he had spent nine days of
 agony was dashed to the ground and destroyed during the three-mile march
 from the peninsula of Iges to the city. It was but another form of his old
 distress to behold that array of prisoners, shuffling timorously through
 the dust of the road, like a flock of sheep with the dog at their heels.
 There is no spectacle in all the world more pitiful than that of a column
 of vanquished troops being marched off into captivity under guard of their
 conquerors, without arms, their empty hands hanging idly at their sides;
 and these men, clad in rags and tatters, besmeared with the filth in which
 they had lain for more than a week, gaunt and wasted after their long
 fast, were more like vagabonds than soldiers; they resembled loathsome,
 horribly dirty tramps, whom the gendarmes would have picked up along the
 highways and consigned to the lockup. As they passed through the Faubourg
 of Torcy, where men paused on the sidewalks and women came to their doors
 to regard them with mournful, compassionate interest, the blush of shame
 rose to Maurice's cheek, he hung his head and a bitter taste came to his
 mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, whose epidermis was thicker and mind more practical, thought only of
 their stupidity in not having brought off with them a loaf of bread
 apiece. In the hurry of their abrupt departure they had even gone off
 without breakfasting, and hunger soon made its presence felt by the
 nerveless sensation in their legs. Others among the prisoners appeared to
 be in the same boat, for they held out money, begging the people of the
 place to sell them something to eat. There was one, an extremely tall man,
 apparently very ill, who displayed a gold piece, extending it above the
 heads of the soldiers of the escort; and he was almost frantic that he
 could purchase nothing. Just at that time Jean, who had been keeping his
 eyes open, perceived a bakery a short distance ahead, before which were
 piled a dozen loaves of bread; he immediately got his money ready and, as
 the column passed, tossed the baker a five-franc piece and endeavored to
 secure two of the loaves; then, when the Prussian who was marching at his
 side pushed him back roughly into the ranks, he protested, demanding that
 he be allowed to recover his money from the baker. But at that juncture
 the captain commanding the detachment, a short, bald-headed man with a
 brutal expression of face, came hastening up; he raised his revolver over
 Jean's head as if about to strike him with the butt, declaring with an
 oath that he would brain the first man that dared to lift a finger. And
 the rest of the captives continued to shamble on, stirring up the dust of
 the road with their shuffling feet, with eyes averted and shoulders bowed,
 cowed and abjectly submissive as a drove of cattle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! how good it would seem to slap the fellow's face just once!" murmured
 Maurice, as if he meant it. "How I should like to let him have just one
 from the shoulder, and drive his teeth down his dirty throat!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And during the remainder of their march he could not endure to look on
 that captain, with his ugly, supercilious face.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had entered Sedan and were crossing the Pont de Meuse, and the scenes
 of violence and brutality became more numerous than ever. A woman darted
 forward and would have embraced a boyish young sergeant&mdash;likely she
 was his mother&mdash;and was repulsed with a blow from a musket-butt that
 felled her to the ground. On the Place Turenne the guards hustled and
 maltreated some citizens because they cast provisions to the prisoners. In
 the Grande Rue one of the convoy fell in endeavoring to secure a bottle
 that a lady extended to him, and was assisted to his feet with kicks. For
 a week now Sedan had witnessed the saddening spectacle of the defeated
 driven like cattle through its streets, and seemed no more accustomed to
 it than at the beginning; each time a fresh detachment passed the city was
 stirred to its very depths by a movement of pity and indignation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean had recovered his equanimity; his thoughts, like Maurice's, reverted
 to Henriette, and the idea occurred to him that they might see Delaherche
 somewhere among the throng. He gave his friend a nudge of the elbow.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Keep your eyes open if we pass through their street presently, will you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 They had scarce more than struck into the Rue Maqua, indeed, when they
 became aware of several pairs of eyes turned on the column from one of the
 tall windows of the factory, and as they drew nearer recognized Delaherche
 and his wife Gilberte, their elbows resting on the railing of the balcony,
 and behind them the tall, rigid form of old Madame Delaherche. They had a
 supply of bread with them, and the manufacturer was tossing the loaves
 down into the hands that were upstretched with tremulous eagerness to
 receive them. Maurice saw at once that his sister was not there, while
 Jean anxiously watched the flying loaves, fearing there might none be left
 for them. They both had raised their arms and were waving them frantically
 above their head, shouting meanwhile with all the force of their lungs:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here we are! This way, this way!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The Delaherches seemed delighted to see them in the midst of their
 surprise. Their faces, pallid with emotion, suddenly brightened, and they
 displayed by the warmth of their gestures the pleasure they experienced in
 the encounter. There was one solitary loaf left, which Gilberte insisted
 on throwing with her own hands, and pitched it into Jean's extended arms
 in such a charmingly awkward way that she gave a winsome laugh at her own
 expense. Maurice, unable to stop on account of the pressure from the rear,
 turned his head and shouted, in a tone of anxious inquiry:
 </p>
 <p>
 "And Henriette? Henriette?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche replied with a long farrago, but his voice was inaudible in the
 shuffling tramp of so many feet. He seemed to understand that the young
 man had failed to catch his meaning, for he gesticulated like a semaphore;
 there was one gesture in particular that he repeated several times,
 extending his arm with a sweeping motion toward the south, apparently
 intending to convey the idea of some point in the remote distance: Off
 there, away off there. Already the head of the column was wheeling into
 the Rue du Minil, the facade of the factory was lost to sight, together
 with the kindly faces of the three Delaherches; the last the two friends
 saw of them was the fluttering of the white handkerchief with which
 Gilberte waved them a farewell.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What did he say?" asked Jean.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, in a fever of anxiety, was still looking to the rear where there
 was nothing to be seen. "I don't know; I could not understand him; I shall
 have no peace of mind until I hear from her."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the trailing, shambling line crept slowly onward, the Prussians urging
 on the weary men with the brutality of conquerors; the column left the
 city by the Minil gate in straggling, long-drawn array, hastening their
 steps, like sheep at whose heels the dogs are snapping.
 </p>
 <p>
 When they passed through Bazeilles Jean and Maurice thought of Weiss, and
 cast their eyes about in an effort to distinguish the site of the little
 house that had been defended with such bravery. While they were at Camp
 Misery they had heard the woeful tale of slaughter and conflagration that
 had blotted the pretty village from existence, and the abominations that
 they now beheld exceeded all they had dreamed of or imagined. At the
 expiration of twelve days the ruins were smoking still; the tottering
 walls had fallen in, there were not ten houses standing. It afforded them
 some small comfort, however, to meet a procession of carts and
 wheelbarrows loaded with Bavarian helmets and muskets that had been
 collected after the conflict. That evidence of the chastisement that had
 been inflicted on those murderers and incendiaries went far toward
 mitigating the affliction of defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
 The column was to halt at Douzy to give the men an opportunity to eat
 breakfast. It was not without much suffering that they reached that place;
 already the prisoners' strength was giving out, exhausted as they were by
 their ten days of fasting. Those who the day before had availed of the
 abundant supplies to gorge themselves were seized with vertigo, their
 enfeebled legs refused to support their weight, and their gluttony, far
 from restoring their lost strength, was a further source of weakness to
 them. The consequence was that, when the train was halted in a meadow to
 the left of the village, these poor creatures flung themselves upon the
 ground with no desire to eat. Wine was wanting; some charitable women who
 came, bringing a few bottles, were driven off by the sentries. One of them
 in her affright fell and sprained her ankle, and there ensued a painful
 scene of tears and hysterics, during which the Prussians confiscated the
 bottles and drank their contents amid jeers and insulting laughter. This
 tender compassion of the peasants for the poor soldiers who were being led
 away into captivity was manifested constantly along the route, while it
 was said the harshness they displayed toward the generals amounted almost
 to cruelty. At that same Douzy, only a few days previously, the villagers
 had hooted and reviled a number of paroled officers who were on their way
 to Pont-a-Mousson. The roads were not safe for general officers; men
 wearing the blouse&mdash;escaped soldiers, or deserters, it may be&mdash;fell
 on them with pitch-forks and endeavored to take their life as traitors,
 credulously pinning their faith to that legend of bargain and sale which,
 even twenty years later, was to continue to shed its opprobrium upon those
 leaders who had commanded armies in that campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice and Jean ate half their bread, and were so fortunate as to have a
 mouthful of brandy with which to wash it down, thanks to the kindness of a
 worthy old farmer. When the order was given to resume their advance,
 however, the distress throughout the convoy was extreme. They were to halt
 for the night at Mouzon, and although the march was a short one, it seemed
 as if it would tax the men's strength more severely than they could bear;
 they could not get on their feet without giving utterance to cries of
 pain, so stiff did their tired legs become the moment they stopped to
 rest. Many removed their shoes to relieve their galled and bleeding feet.
 Dysentery continued to rage; a man fell before they had gone half a mile,
 and they had to prop him against a wall and leave him. A little further on
 two others sank at the foot of a hedge, and it was night before an old
 woman came along and picked them up. All were stumbling, tottering, and
 dragging themselves along, supporting their forms with canes, which the
 Prussians, perhaps in derision, had suffered them to cut at the margin of
 a wood. They were a straggling array of tramps and beggars, covered with
 sores, haggard, emaciated, and footsore; a sight to bring tears to the
 eyes of the most stony-hearted. And the guards continued to be as brutally
 strict as ever; those who for any purpose attempted to leave the ranks
 were driven back with blows, and the platoon that brought up the rear had
 orders to prod with their bayonets those who hung back. A sergeant having
 refused to go further, the captain summoned two of his men and instructed
 them to seize him, one by either arm, and in this manner the wretched man
 was dragged over the ground until he agreed to walk. And what made the
 whole thing more bitter and harder to endure was the utter insignificance
 of that little pimply-faced, bald-headed officer, so insufferably
 consequential in his brutality, who took advantage of his knowledge of
 French to vituperate the prisoners in it in curt, incisive words that cut
 and stung like the lash of a whip.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh!" Maurice furiously exclaimed, "to get the puppy in my hands and drain
 him of his blood, drop by drop!"
 </p>
 <p>
 His powers of endurance were almost exhausted, but it was his rage that he
 had to choke down, even more than his fatigue, that was cause of his
 suffering. Everything exasperated him and set on edge his tingling nerves;
 the harsh notes of the Prussian trumpets particularly, which inspired him
 with a desire to scream each time he heard them. He felt he should never
 reach the end of their cruel journey without some outbreak that would
 bring down on him the utmost severity of the guard. Even now, when
 traversing the smallest hamlets, he suffered horribly and felt as if he
 should die with shame to behold the eyes of the women fixed pityingly on
 him; what would it be when they should enter Germany, and the populace of
 the great cities should crowd the streets to laugh and jeer at them as
 they passed? And he pictured to himself the cattle cars into which they
 would be crowded for transportation, the discomforts and humiliations they
 would have to suffer on the journey, the dismal life in German fortresses
 under the leaden, wintry sky. No, no; he would have none of it; better to
 take the risk of leaving his bones by the roadside on French soil than go
 and rot off yonder, for months and months, perhaps, in the dark depths of
 a casemate.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen," he said below his breath to Jean, who was walking at his side;
 "we will wait until we come to a wood; then we'll break through the guards
 and run for it among the trees. The Belgian frontier is not far away; we
 shall have no trouble in finding someone to guide us to it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, accustomed as he was to look at things coolly and calculate chances,
 put his veto on the mad scheme, although he, too, in his revolt, was
 beginning to meditate the possibilities of an escape.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Have you taken leave of your senses! the guard will fire on us, and we
 shall both be killed."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice replied there was a chance the soldiers might not hit them,
 and then, after all, if their aim should prove true, it would not matter
 so very much.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well!" rejoined Jean, "but what is going to become of us afterward,
 dressed in uniform as we are? You know perfectly well that the country is
 swarming in every direction with Prussian troops; we could not go far
 unless we had other clothes to put on. No, no, my lad, it's too risky;
 I'll not let you attempt such an insane project."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he took the young man's arm and held it pressed against his side, as
 if they were mutually sustaining each other, continuing meanwhile to chide
 and soothe him in a tone that was at once rough and affectionate.
 </p>
 <p>
 Just then the sound of a whispered conversation close behind them caused
 them to turn and look around. It was Chouteau and Loubet, who had left the
 peninsula of Iges that morning at the same time as they, and whom they had
 managed to steer clear of until the present moment. Now the two worthies
 were close at their heels, and Chouteau must have overheard Maurice's
 words, his plan for escaping through the mazes of a forest, for he had
 adopted it on his own behalf. His breath was hot upon their neck as he
 murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, comrades, count us in on that. That's a capital idea of yours, to
 skip the ranch. Some of the boys have gone already, and sure we're not
 going to be such fools as to let those bloody pigs drag us away like dogs
 into their infernal country. What do you say, eh? Shall we four make a
 break for liberty?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice's excitement was rising to fever-heat again; Jean turned and said
 to the tempter:
 </p>
 <p>
 "If you are so anxious to get away, why don't you go? there's nothing to
 prevent you. What are you up to, any way?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He flinched a little before the corporal's direct glance, and allowed the
 true motive of his proposal to escape him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>! it would be better that four should share the undertaking.
 One or two of us might have a chance of getting off."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Jean, with an emphatic shake of the head, refused to have anything
 whatever to do with the matter; he distrusted the gentleman, he said, as
 he was afraid he would play them some of his dirty tricks. He had to exert
 all his authority with Maurice to retain him on his side, for at that very
 moment an opportunity presented itself for attempting the enterprise; they
 were passing the border of a small but very dense wood, separated from the
 road only by the width of a field that was covered by a thick growth of
 underbrush. Why should they not dash across that field and vanish in the
 thicket? was there not safety for them in that direction?
 </p>
 <p>
 Loubet had so far said nothing. His mind was made up, however, that he was
 not going to Germany to run to seed in one of their dungeons, and his
 nose, mobile as a hound's, was sniffing the atmosphere, his shifty eyes
 were watching for the favorable moment. He would trust to his legs and his
 mother wit, which had always helped him out of his scrapes thus far. His
 decision was quickly made.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>zut</i>! I've had enough of it; I'm off!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He broke through the line of the escort, and with a single bound was in
 the field, Chouteau following his example and running at his side. Two of
 the Prussian soldiers immediately started in pursuit, but the others
 seemed dazed, and it did not occur to them to send a ball after the
 fugitives. The entire episode was so soon over that it was not easy to
 note its different phases. Loubet dodged and doubled among the bushes and
 it appeared as if he would certainly succeed in getting off, while
 Chouteau, less nimble, was on the point of being captured, but the latter,
 summoning up all his energies in a supreme burst of speed, caught up with
 his comrade and dexterously tripped him; and while the two Prussians were
 lumbering up to secure the fallen man, the other darted into the wood and
 vanished. The guard, finally remembering that they had muskets, fired a
 few ineffectual shots, and there was some attempt made to search the
 thicket, which resulted in nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
 Meantime the two soldiers were pummeling poor Loubet, who had not regained
 his feet. The captain came running up, beside himself with anger, and
 talked of making an example, and with this encouragement kicks and cuffs
 and blows from musket-butts continued to rain down upon the wretched man
 with such fury that when at last they stood him on his feet he was found
 to have an arm broken and his skull fractured. A peasant came along,
 driving a cart, in which he was placed, but he died before reaching
 Mouzon.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You see," was all that Jean said to Maurice.
 </p>
 <p>
 The two friends cast a look in the direction of the wood that sufficiently
 expressed their sentiments toward the scoundrel who had gained his freedom
 by such base means, while their hearts were stirred with feelings of
 deepest compassion for the poor devil whom he had made his victim, a
 guzzler and a toper, who certainly did not amount to much, but a merry,
 good-natured fellow all the same, and nobody's fool. And that was always
 the way with those who kept bad company, Jean moralizingly observed: they
 might be very fly, but sooner or later a bigger rascal was sure to come
 along and make a meal of them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Notwithstanding this terrible lesson Maurice, upon reaching Mouzon, was
 still possessed by his unalterable determination to attempt an escape. The
 prisoners were in such an exhausted condition when they reached the place
 that the Prussians had to assist them to set up the few tents that were
 placed at their disposal. The camp was formed near the town, on low and
 marshy ground, and the worst of the business was that another convoy
 having occupied the spot the day before, the field was absolutely
 invisible under the superincumbent filth; it was no better than a common
 cesspool, of unimaginable foulness. The sole means the men had of
 self-protection was to scatter over the ground some large flat stones, of
 which they were so fortunate as to find a number in the vicinity. By way
 of compensation they had a somewhat less hard time of it that evening; the
 strictness of their guardians was relaxed a little once the captain had
 disappeared, doubtless to seek the comforts of an inn. The sentries began
 by winking at the irregularity of the proceeding when some children came
 along and commenced to toss fruit, apples and pears, over their heads to
 the prisoners; the next thing was they allowed the people of the
 neighborhood to enter the lines, so that in a short time the camp was
 swarming with impromptu merchants, men and women, offering for sale bread,
 wine, cigars, even. Those who had money had no trouble in supplying their
 needs so far as eating, drinking, and smoking were concerned. A bustling
 animation prevailed in the dim twilight; it was like a corner of the
 market place in a town where a fair is being held.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice drew Jean behind their tent and again said to him in his
 nervous, flighty way:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I can't stand it; I shall make an effort to get away as soon as it is
 dark. To-morrow our course will take us away from the frontier; it will be
 too late."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well, we'll try it," Jean replied, his powers of resistance
 exhausted, his imagination, too, seduced by the pleasing idea of freedom.
 "They can't do more than kill us."
 </p>
 <p>
 After that he began to scrutinize more narrowly the venders who surrounded
 him on every side. There were some among the comrades who had succeeded in
 supplying themselves with blouse and trousers, and it was reported that
 some of the charitable people of the place had regular stocks of garments
 on hand, designed to assist prisoners in escaping. And almost immediately
 his attention was attracted to a pretty girl, a tall blonde of sixteen
 with a pair of magnificent eyes, who had on her arm a basket containing
 three loaves of bread. She was not crying her wares like the rest; an
 anxious, engaging smile played on her red lips, her manner was hesitating.
 He looked her steadily in the face; their glances met and for an instant
 remained confounded. Then she came up, with the embarrassed smile of a
 girl unaccustomed to such business.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you wish to buy some bread?"
 </p>
 <p>
 He made no reply, but questioned her by an imperceptible movement of the
 eyelids. On her answering yes, by an affirmative nod of the head, he asked
 in a very low tone of voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "There is clothing?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, under the loaves."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then she began to cry her merchandise aloud: "Bread! bread! who'll buy my
 bread?" But when Maurice would have slipped a twenty-franc piece into her
 fingers she drew back her hand abruptly and ran away, leaving the basket
 with them. The last they saw of her was the happy, tender look in her
 pretty eyes, as in the distance she turned and smiled on them.
 </p>
 <p>
 When they were in possession of the basket Jean and Maurice found
 difficulties staring them in the face. They had strayed away from their
 tent, and in their agitated condition felt they should never succeed in
 finding it again. Where were they to bestow themselves? and how effect
 their change of garments? It seemed to them that the eyes of the entire
 assemblage were focused on the basket, which Jean carried with an awkward
 air, as if it contained dynamite, and that its contents must be plainly
 visible to everyone. It would not do to waste time, however; they must be
 up and doing. They stepped into the first vacant tent they came to, where
 each of them hurriedly slipped on a pair of trousers and donned a blouse,
 having first deposited their discarded uniforms in the basket, which they
 placed on the ground in a dark corner of the tent and abandoned to its
 fate. There was a circumstance that gave them no small uneasiness,
 however; they found only one head-covering, a knitted woolen cap, which
 Jean insisted Maurice should wear. The former, fearing his bare-headedness
 might excite suspicion, was hanging about the precincts of the camp on the
 lookout for a covering of some description, when it occurred to him to
 purchase his hat from an extremely dirty old man who was selling cigars.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Brussels cigars, three sous apiece, two for five!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Customs regulations were in abeyance since the battle of Sedan, and the
 imports of Belgian merchandise had been greatly stimulated. The old man
 had been making a handsome profit from his traffic, but that did not
 prevent him from driving a sharp bargain when he understood the reason why
 the two men wanted to buy his hat, a greasy old affair of felt with a
 great hole in its crown. He finally consented to part with it for two
 five-franc pieces, grumbling that he should certainly have a cold in his
 head.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Jean had another idea, which was neither more nor less than to buy
 out the old fellow's stock in trade, the two dozen cigars that remained
 unsold. The bargain effected, he pulled his hat down over his eyes and
 began to cry in the itinerant hawker's drawling tone:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here you are, Brussels cigars, two for three sous, two for three sous!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Their safety was now assured. He signaled Maurice to go on before. It
 happened to the latter to discover an umbrella lying on the grass; he
 picked it up and, as a few drops of rain began to fall just then, opened
 it tranquilly as they were about to pass the line of sentries.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Two for three sous, two for three sous, Brussels cigars!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It took Jean less than two minutes to dispose of his stock of merchandise.
 The men came crowding about him with chaff and laughter: a reasonable
 fellow, that; he didn't rob poor chaps of their money! The Prussians
 themselves were attracted by such unheard-of bargains, and he was
 compelled to trade with them. He had all the time been working his way
 toward the edge of the enceinte, and his last two cigars went to a big
 sergeant with an immense beard, who could not speak a word of French.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't walk so fast, confound it!" Jean breathed in a whisper behind
 Maurice's back. "You'll have them after us."
 </p>
 <p>
 Their legs seemed inclined to run away with them, although they did their
 best to strike a sober gait. It caused them a great effort to pause a
 moment at a cross-roads, where a number of people were collected before an
 inn. Some villagers were chatting peaceably with German soldiers, and the
 two runaways made a pretense of listening, and even hazarded a few
 observations on the weather and the probability of the rain continuing
 during the night. They trembled when they beheld a man, a fleshy
 gentleman, eying them attentively, but as he smiled with an air of great
 good-nature they thought they might venture to address him, asking in a
 whisper:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can you tell us if the road to Belgium is guarded, sir?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is; but you will be safe if you cross this wood and afterward cut
 across the fields, to the left."
 </p>
 <p>
 Once they were in the wood, in the deep, dark silence of the slumbering
 trees, where no sound reached their ears, where nothing stirred and they
 believed their safety was assured them, they sank into each other's arms
 in an uncontrollable impulse of emotion. Maurice was sobbing violently,
 while big tears trickled slowly down Jean's cheeks. It was the natural
 revulsion of their overtaxed feelings after the long-protracted ordeal
 they had passed through, the joy and delight of their mutual assurance
 that their troubles were at an end, and that thenceforth suffering and
 they were to be strangers. And united by the memory of what they had
 endured together in ties closer than those of brotherhood, they clasped
 each other in a wild embrace, and the kiss that they exchanged at that
 moment seemed to them to possess a savor and a poignancy such as they had
 never experienced before in all their life; a kiss such as they never
 could receive from lips of woman, sealing their undying friendship, giving
 additional confirmation to the certainty that thereafter their two hearts
 would be but one, for all eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
 When they had separated at last: "Little one," said Jean, in a trembling
 voice, "it is well for us to be here, but we are not at the end. We must
 look about a bit and try to find our bearings."
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, although he had no acquaintance with that part of the frontier,
 declared that all they had to do was to pursue a straight course, whereon
 they resumed their way, moving among the trees in Indian file with the
 greatest circumspection, until they reached the edge of the thicket.
 There, mindful of the injunction of the kind-hearted villager, they were
 about to turn to the left and take a short cut across the fields, but on
 coming to a road, bordered with a row of poplars on either side they
 beheld directly in their path the watch-fire of a Prussian detachment. The
 bayonet of the sentry, pacing his beat, gleamed in the ruddy light, the
 men were finishing their soup and conversing; the fugitives stood not upon
 the order of their going, but plunged into the recesses of the wood again,
 in mortal terror lest they might be pursued. They thought they heard the
 sound of voices, of footsteps on their trail, and thus for over an hour
 they wandered at random among the copses, until all idea of locality was
 obliterated from their brain; now racing like affrighted animals through
 the underbrush, again brought up all standing, the cold sweat trickling
 down their face, before a tree in which they beheld a Prussian. And the
 end of it was that they again came out on the poplar-bordered road not
 more than ten paces from the sentry, and quite near the soldiers, who were
 toasting their toes in tranquil comfort.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hang the luck!" grumbled Jean. "This must be an enchanted wood."
 </p>
 <p>
 This time, however, they had been heard. The sound of snapping twigs and
 rolling stones betrayed them. And as they did not answer the challenge of
 the sentry, but made off at the double-quick, the men seized their muskets
 and sent a shower of bullets crashing through the thicket, into which the
 fugitives had plunged incontinently.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" ejaculated Jean, with a stifled cry of pain.
 </p>
 <p>
 He had received something that felt like the cut of a whip in the calf of
 his left leg, but the impact was so violent that it drove him up against a
 tree.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Are you hurt?" Maurice anxiously inquired.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, and in the leg, worse luck!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They both stood holding their breath and listening, in dread expectancy of
 hearing their pursuers clamoring at their heels; but the firing had ceased
 and nothing stirred amid the intense stillness that had again settled down
 upon the wood and the surrounding country. It was evident that the
 Prussians had no inclination to beat up the thicket.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, who was doing his best to keep on his feet; forced back a groan.
 Maurice sustained him with his arm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can't you walk?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "I should say not!" He gave way to a fit of rage, he, always so
 self-contained. He clenched his fists, could have thumped himself. "God in
 Heaven, if this is not hard luck! to have one's legs knocked from under
 him at the very time he is most in need of them! It's too bad, too bad, by
 my soul it is! Go on, you, and put yourself in safety!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice laughed quietly as he answered:
 </p>
 <p>
 "That is silly talk!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He took his friend's arm and helped him along, for neither of them had any
 desire to linger there. When, laboriously and by dint of heroic effort,
 they had advanced some half-dozen paces further, they halted again with
 renewed alarm at beholding before them a house, standing at the margin of
 the wood, apparently a sort of farmhouse. Not a light was visible at any
 of the windows, the open courtyard gate yawned upon the dark and deserted
 dwelling. And when they plucked up their courage a little and ventured to
 enter the courtyard, great was their surprise to find a horse standing
 there with a saddle on his back, with nothing to indicate the why or
 wherefore of his being there. Perhaps it was the owner's intention to
 return, perhaps he was lying behind a bush with a bullet in his brain.
 They never learned how it was.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice had conceived a new scheme, which appeared to afford him great
 satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, the frontier is too far away; we should never succeed in
 reaching it without a guide. What do you say to changing our plan and
 going to Uncle Fouchard's, at Remilly? I am so well acquainted with every
 inch of the road that I'm sure I could take you there with my eyes
 bandaged. Don't you think it's a good idea, eh? I'll put you on this
 horse, and I suppose Uncle Fouchard will grumble, but he'll take us in."
 </p>
 <p>
 Before starting he wished to take a look at the injured leg. There were
 two orifices; the ball appeared to have entered the limb and passed out,
 fracturing the tibia in its course. The flow of blood had not been great;
 he did nothing more than bandage the upper part of the calf tightly with
 his handkerchief.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you fly, and leave me here," Jean said again.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hold your tongue; you are silly!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean was seated firmly in the saddle Maurice took the bridle and they
 made a start. It was somewhere about eleven o'clock, and he hoped to make
 the journey in three hours, even if they should be unable to proceed
 faster than a walk. A difficulty that he had not thought of until then,
 however, presented itself to his mind and for a moment filled him with
 consternation: how were they to cross the Meuse in order to get to the
 left bank? The bridge at Mouzon would certainly be guarded. At last he
 remembered that there was a ferry lower down the stream, at Villers, and
 trusting to luck to befriend him, he shaped his course for that village,
 striking across the meadows and tilled fields of the right bank. All went
 well enough at first; they had only to dodge a cavalry patrol which forced
 them to hide in the shadow of a wall and remain there half an hour. Then
 the rain began to come down in earnest and his progress became more
 laborious, compelled as he was to tramp through the sodden fields beside
 the horse, which fortunately showed itself to be a fine specimen of the
 equine race, and perfectly gentle. On reaching Villers he found that his
 trust in the blind goddess, Fortune, had not been misplaced; the ferryman,
 who, at that late hour, had just returned from setting a Bavarian officer
 across the river, took them at once and landed them on the other shore
 without delay or accident.
 </p>
 <p>
 And it was not until they reached the village, where they narrowly escaped
 falling into the clutches of the pickets who were stationed along the
 entire length of the Remilly road, that their dangers and hardships really
 commenced; again they were obliged to take to the fields, feeling their
 way along blind paths and cart-tracks that could scarcely be discerned in
 the darkness. The most trivial obstacle sufficed to drive them a long way
 out of their course. They squeezed through hedges, scrambled down and up
 the steep banks of ditches, forced a passage for themselves through the
 densest thickets. Jean, in whom a low fever had developed under the
 drizzling rain, had sunk down crosswise on his saddle in a condition of
 semi-consciousness, holding on with both hands by the horse's mane, while
 Maurice, who had slipped the bridle over his right arm, had to steady him
 by the legs to keep him from tumbling to the ground. For more than a
 league, for two long, weary hours that seemed like an eternity, did they
 toil onward in this fatiguing way; floundering, stumbling, slipping in
 such a manner that it seemed at every moment as if men and beast must land
 together in a heap at the bottom of some descent. The spectacle they
 presented was one of utter, abject misery, besplashed with mud, the horse
 trembling in every limb, the man upon his back a helpless mass, as if at
 his last gasp, the other, wild-eyed and pale as death, keeping his feet
 only by an effort of fraternal love. Day was breaking; it was not far from
 five o'clock when at last they came to Remilly.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the courtyard of his little farmhouse, which was situated at the
 extremity of the pass of Harancourt, overlooking the village, Father
 Fouchard was stowing away in his carriole the carcasses of two sheep that
 he had slaughtered the day before. The sight of his nephew, coming to him
 at that hour and in that sorry plight, caused him such perturbation of
 spirit that, after the first explanatory words, he roughly cried:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You want me to take you in, you and your friend? and then settle matters
 with the Prussians afterward, I suppose. I'm much obliged to you, but no!
 I might as well die right straight off and have done with it."
 </p>
 <p>
 He did not go so far, however, as to prohibit Maurice and Prosper from
 taking Jean from the horse and laying him on the great table in the
 kitchen. Silvine ran and got the bolster from her bed and slipped it
 beneath the head of the wounded man, who was still unconscious. But it
 irritated the old fellow to see the man lying on his table; he grumbled
 and fretted, saying that the kitchen was no place for him; why did they
 not take him away to the hospital at once? since there fortunately was a
 hospital at Remilly, near the church, in the old schoolhouse; and there
 was a big room in it, with everything nice and comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
 "To the hospital!" Maurice hotly replied, "and have the Prussians pack him
 off to Germany as soon as he is well, for you know they treat all the
 wounded as prisoners of war. Do you take me for a fool, uncle? I did not
 bring him here to give him up."
 </p>
 <p>
 Things were beginning to look dubious, the uncle was threatening to pitch
 them out upon the road, when someone mentioned Henriette's name.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What about Henriette?" inquired the young man.
 </p>
 <p>
 And he learned that his sister had been an inmate of the house at Remilly
 for the last two days; her affliction had weighed so heavily on her that
 life at Sedan, where her existence had hitherto been a happy one, was
 become a burden greater than she could bear. Chancing to meet with Doctor
 Dalichamp of Raucourt, with whom she was acquainted, her conversation with
 him had been the means of bringing her to take up her abode with Father
 Fouchard, in whose house she had a little bedroom, in order to devote
 herself entirely to the care of the sufferers in the neighboring hospital.
 That alone, she said, would serve to quiet her bitter memories. She paid
 her board and was the means of introducing many small comforts into the
 life of the farmhouse, which caused Father Fouchard to regard her with an
 eye of favor. The weather was always fine with him, provided he was making
 money.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah! so my sister is here," said Maurice. "That must have been what M.
 Delaherche wished to tell me, with his gestures that I could not
 understand. Very well; if she is here, that settles it; we shall remain."
 </p>
 <p>
 Notwithstanding his fatigue he started off at once in quest of her at the
 ambulance, where she had been on duty during the preceding night, while
 the uncle cursed his luck that kept him from being off with the carriole
 to sell his mutton among the neighboring villages, so long as the
 confounded business that he had got mixed up in remained unfinished.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice returned with Henriette they caught the old man making a
 critical examination of the horse, that Prosper had led away to the
 stable. The animal seemed to please him; he was knocked up, but showed
 signs of strength and endurance. The young man laughed and told his uncle
 he might have him as a gift if he fancied him, while Henriette, taking her
 relative aside, assured him Jean should be no expense to him; that she
 would take charge of him and nurse him, and he might have the little room
 behind the cow-stables, where no Prussian would ever think to look for
 him. And Father Fouchard, still wearing a very sulky face and but half
 convinced that there was anything to be made out of the affair, finally
 closed the discussion by jumping into his carriole and driving off,
 leaving her at liberty to act as she pleased.
 </p>
 <p>
 It took Henriette but a few minutes, with the assistance of Silvine and
 Prosper, to put the room in order; then she had Jean brought in and they
 laid him on a cool, clean bed, he giving no sign of life during the
 operation save to mutter some unintelligible words. He opened his eyes and
 looked about him, but seemed not to be conscious of anyone's presence in
 the room. Maurice, who was just beginning to be aware how utterly
 prostrated he was by his fatigue, was drinking a glass of wine and eating
 a bit of cold meat, left over from the yesterday's dinner, when Doctor
 Dalichamp came in, as was his daily custom previous to visiting the
 hospital, and the young man, in his anxiety for his friend, mustered up
 his strength to follow him, together with his sister, to the bedside of
 the patient.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor was a short, thick-set man, with a big round head, on which the
 hair, as well as the fringe of beard about his face, had long since begun
 to be tinged with gray. The skin of his ruddy, mottled face was tough and
 indurated as a peasant's, spending as he did most of his time in the open
 air, always on the go to relieve the sufferings of his fellow-creatures;
 while the large, bright eyes, the massive nose, indicative of obstinacy,
 and the benignant if somewhat sensual mouth bore witness to the lifelong
 charities and good works of the honest country doctor; a little brusque at
 times, not a man of genius, but whom many years of practice in his
 profession had made an excellent healer.
 </p>
 <p>
 When he had examined Jean, still in a comatose state, he murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am very much afraid that amputation will be necessary."
 </p>
 <p>
 The words produced a painful impression on Maurice and Henriette.
 Presently, however, he added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Perhaps we may be able to save the leg, but it will require the utmost
 care and attention, and will take a very long time. For the moment his
 physical and mental depression is such that the only thing to do is to let
 him sleep. To-morrow we shall know more."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, having applied a dressing to the wound, he turned to Maurice, whom
 he had known in bygone days, when he was a boy.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And you, my good fellow, would be better off in bed than sitting there."
 </p>
 <p>
 The young man continued to gaze before him into vacancy, as if he had not
 heard. In the confused hallucination that was due to his fatigue he
 developed a kind of delirium, a supersensitive nervous excitation that
 embraced all he had suffered in mind and body since the beginning of the
 campaign. The spectacle of his friend's wretched state, his own condition,
 scarce less pitiful, defeated, his hands tied, good for nothing, the
 reflection that all those heroic efforts had culminated in such disaster,
 all combined to incite him to frantic rebellion against destiny. At last
 he spoke.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is not ended; no, no! we have not seen the end, and I must go away.
 Since <i>he</i> must lie there on his back for weeks, for months, perhaps,
 I cannot stay; I must go, I must go at once. You will assist me, won't
 you, doctor? you will supply me with the means to escape and get back to
 Paris?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Pale and trembling, Henriette threw her arms about him and caught him to
 her bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What words are those you speak? enfeebled as you are, after all the
 suffering you have endured! but think not I shall let you go; you shall
 stay here with me! Have you not paid the debt you owe your country? and
 should you not think of me, too, whom you would leave to loneliness? of
 me, who have nothing now in all the wide world save you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Their tears flowed and were mingled. They held each other in a wild
 tumultuous embrace, with that fond affection which, in twins, often seems
 as if it antedated existence. But for all that his exaltation did not
 subside, but assumed a higher pitch.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I tell you I must go. Should I not go I feel I should die of grief and
 shame. You can have no idea how my blood boils and seethes in my veins at
 the thought of remaining here in idleness. I tell you that this business
 is not going to end thus, that we must be avenged. On whom, on what? Ah!
 that I cannot tell; but avenged we must and shall be for such misfortune,
 in order that we may yet have courage to live on!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Doctor Dalichamp, who had been watching the scene with intense interest,
 cautioned Henriette by signal to make no reply. Maurice would doubtless be
 more rational after he should have slept; and sleep he did, all that day
 and all the succeeding night, for more than twenty hours, and never
 stirred hand or foot. When he awoke next morning, however, he was as
 inflexible as ever in his determination to go away. The fever had
 subsided; he was gloomy and restless, in haste to withdraw himself from
 influences that he feared might weaken his patriotic fervor. His sister,
 with many tears, made up her mind that he must be allowed to have his way,
 and Doctor Dalichamp, when he came to make his morning visit, promised to
 do what he could to facilitate the young man's escape by turning over to
 him the papers of a hospital attendant who had died recently at Raucourt.
 It was arranged that Maurice should don the gray blouse with the red cross
 of Geneva on its sleeve and pass through Belgium, thence to make his way
 as best he might to Paris, access to which was as yet uninterrupted.
 </p>
 <p>
 He did not leave the house that day, keeping himself out of sight and
 waiting for night to come. He scarcely opened his mouth, although he did
 make an attempt to enlist the new farm-hand in his enterprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, Prosper, don't you feel as if you would like to go back and have one
 more look at the Prussians?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The ex-chasseur d'Afrique, who was eating a cheese sandwich, stopped and
 held his knife suspended in the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It don't strike me that it is worth while, from what we were allowed to
 see of them before. Why should you wish me to go back there, when the only
 use our generals can find for the cavalry is to send it in after the
 battle is ended and let it be cut to pieces? No, faith, I'm sick of the
 business, giving us such dirty work as that to do!" There was silence
 between them for a moment; then he went on, doubtless to quiet the
 reproaches of his conscience as a soldier: "And then the work is too heavy
 here just now; the plowing is just commencing, and then there'll be the
 fall sowing to be looked after. We must think of the farm work, mustn't
 we? for fighting is well enough in its way, but what would become of us if
 we should cease to till the ground? You see how it is; I can't leave my
 work. Not that I am particularly in love with Father Fouchard, for I doubt
 very strongly if I shall ever see the color of his money, but the beasties
 are beginning to take to me, and faith! when I was up there in the Old
 Field this morning, and gave a look at that d&mdash;&mdash;d Sedan lying
 yonder in the distance, you can't tell how good it made me feel to be
 guiding my oxen and driving the plow through the furrow, all alone in the
 bright sunshine."
 </p>
 <p>
 As soon as it was fairly dark, Doctor Dalichamp came driving up in his old
 gig. It was his intention to see Maurice to the frontier. Father Fouchard,
 well pleased to be rid of one of his guests at least, stepped out upon the
 road to watch and make sure there were none of the enemy's patrols
 prowling in the neighborhood, while Silvine put a few stitches in the
 blouse of the defunct ambulance man, on the sleeve of which the red cross
 of the corps was prominently displayed. The doctor, before taking his
 place in the vehicle, examined Jean's leg anew, but could not as yet
 promise that he would be able to save it. The patient was still in a
 profound lethargy, recognizing no one, never opening his mouth to speak,
 and Maurice was about to leave him without the comfort of a farewell,
 when, bending over to give him a last embrace, he saw him open his eyes to
 their full extent; the lips parted, and in a faint voice he said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are going away?" And in reply to their astonished looks: "Yes, I
 heard what you said, though I could not stir. Take the remainder of the
 money, then. Put your hand in my trousers' pocket and take it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Each of them had remaining nearly two hundred francs of the sum they had
 received from the corps paymaster.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice protested. "The money!" he exclaimed. "Why, you have more need
 of it than I, who have the use of both my legs. Two hundred francs will be
 abundantly sufficient to see me to Paris, and to get knocked in the head
 afterward won't cost me a penny. I thank you, though, old fellow, all the
 same, and good-by and good-luck to you; thanks, too, for having always
 been so good and thoughtful, for, had it not been for you, I should
 certainly be lying now at the bottom of some ditch, like a dead dog."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean made a deprecating gesture. "Hush. You owe me nothing; we are quits.
 Would not the Prussians have gathered me in out there the other day had
 you not picked me up and carried me off on your back? and yesterday again
 you saved me from their clutches. Twice have I been beholden to you for my
 life, and now I am in your debt. Ah, how unhappy I shall be when I am no
 longer with you!" His voice trembled and tears rose to his eyes. "Kiss me,
 dear boy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They embraced, and, as it had been in the wood the day before, that kiss
 set the seal to the brotherhood of dangers braved in each other's company,
 those few weeks of soldier's life in common that had served to bind their
 hearts together with closer ties than years of ordinary friendship could
 have done. Days of famine, sleepless nights, the fatigue of the weary
 march, death ever present to their eyes, these things made the foundation
 on which their affection rested. When two hearts have thus by mutual gift
 bestowed themselves the one upon the other and become fused and molten
 into one, is it possible ever to sever the connection? But the kiss they
 had exchanged the day before, among the darkling shadows of the forest,
 was replete with the joy of their new-found safety and the hope that their
 escape awakened in their bosom, while this was the kiss of parting, full
 of anguish and doubt unutterable. Would they meet again some day? and how,
 under what circumstances of sorrow or of gladness?
 </p>
 <p>
 Doctor Dalichamp had clambered into his gig and was calling to Maurice.
 The young man threw all his heart and soul into the embrace he gave his
 sister Henriette, who, pale as death in her black mourning garments,
 looked on his face in silence through her tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He whom I leave to your care is my brother. Watch over him, love him as I
 love him!"

 <h2>
 IV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Jean's chamber was a large room, with floor of brick and whitewashed
 walls, that had once done duty as a store-room for the fruit grown on the
 farm. A faint, pleasant odor of pears and apples lingered there still, and
 for furniture there was an iron bedstead, a pine table and two chairs, to
 say nothing of a huge old walnut clothes-press, tremendously deep and
 wide, that looked as if it might hold an army. A lazy, restful quiet
 reigned there all day long, broken only by the deadened sounds that came
 from the adjacent stables, the faint lowing of the cattle, the occasional
 thud of a hoof upon the earthen floor. The window, which had a southern
 aspect, let in a flood of cheerful sunlight; all the view it afforded was
 a bit of hillside and a wheat field, edged by a little wood. And this
 mysterious chamber was so well hidden from prying eyes that never a one in
 all the world would have suspected its existence.
 </p>
 <p>
 As it was to be her kingdom, Henriette constituted herself lawmaker from
 the beginning. The regulation was that no one save she and the doctor
 should have access to Jean; this in order to avert suspicion. Silvine,
 even, was never to set foot in the room unless by direction. Early each
 morning the two women came in and put things to rights, and after that,
 all the long day, the door was as impenetrable as if it had been a wall of
 stone. And thus it was that Jean found himself suddenly secluded from the
 world, after many weeks of tumultuous activity, seeing no face save that
 of the gentle woman whose footfall on the floor gave back no sound. She
 appeared to him, as he had beheld her for the first time down yonder in
 Sedan, like an apparition, with her somewhat large mouth, her delicate,
 small features, her hair the hue of ripened grain, hovering about his
 bedside and ministering to his wants with an air of infinite goodness.
 </p>
 <p>
 The patient's fever was so violent during the first few days that
 Henriette scarce ever left him. Doctor Dalichamp dropped in every morning
 on his way to the hospital and examined and dressed the wound. As the ball
 had passed out, after breaking the tibia, he was surprised that the case
 presented no better aspect; he feared there was a splinter of the bone
 remaining there that he had not succeeded in finding with the probe, and
 that might make resection necessary. He mentioned the matter to Jean, but
 the young man could not endure the thought of an operation that would
 leave him with one leg shorter than the other and lame him permanently.
 No, no! he would rather die than be a cripple for life. So the good
 doctor, leaving the wound to develop further symptoms, confined himself
 for the present to applying a dressing of lint saturated with sweet oil
 and phenic acid having first inserted a drain&mdash;an India rubber tube&mdash;to
 carry off the pus. He frankly told his patient, however, that unless he
 submitted to an operation he must not hope to have the use of his limb for
 a very long time. Still, after the second week, the fever subsided and the
 young man's general condition was improved, so long as he could be content
 to rest quiet in his bed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Jean's and Henriette's relations began to be established on a more
 systematic basis. Fixed habits commenced to prevail; it seemed to them
 that they had never lived otherwise&mdash;that they were to go on living
 forever in that way. All the hours and moments that she did not devote to
 the ambulance were spent with him; she saw to it that he had his food and
 drink at proper intervals. She assisted him to turn in bed with a strength
 of wrist that no one, seeing her slender arms, would have supposed was in
 her. At times they would converse; but as a general thing, especially in
 the earlier days, they had not much to say. They never seemed to tire of
 each other's company, though. On the whole it was a very pleasant life
 they led in that calm, restful atmosphere, he with the horrible scenes of
 the battlefield still fresh in his memory, she in her widow's weeds, her
 heart bruised and bleeding with the great loss she had sustained. At first
 he had experienced a sensation of embarrassment, for he felt she was his
 superior, almost a lady, indeed, while he had never been aught more than a
 common soldier and a peasant. He could barely read and write. When finally
 he came to see that she affected no airs of superiority, but treated him
 on the footing of an equal, his confidence returned to him in a measure
 and he showed himself in his true colors, as a man of intelligence by
 reason of his sound, unpretentious common sense. Besides, he was surprised
 at times to think he could note a change was gradually coming over him; it
 seemed to him that his mind was less torpid than it had been, that it was
 clearer and more active, that he had novel ideas in his head, and more of
 them; could it be that the abominable life he had been leading for the
 last two months, his horrible sufferings, physical and moral, had exerted
 a refining influence on him? But that which assisted him most to overcome
 his shyness was to find that she was really not so very much wiser than
 he. She was but a little child when, at her mother's death, she became the
 household drudge, with her three men to care for, as she herself expressed
 it&mdash;her grandfather, her father, and her brother&mdash;and she had
 not had the time to lay in a large stock of learning. She could read and
 write, could spell words that were not too long, and "do sums," if they
 were not too intricate; and that was the extent of her acquirement. And if
 she continued to intimidate him still, if he considered her far and away
 the superior of all other women upon earth, it was because he knew the
 ineffable tenderness, the goodness of heart, the unflinching courage, that
 animated that frail little body, who went about her duties silently and
 met them as if they had been pleasures.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had in Maurice a subject of conversation that was of common interest
 to them both and of which they never wearied. It was to Maurice's friend,
 his brother, to whom she was devoting herself thus tenderly, the brave,
 kind man, so ready with his aid in time of trouble, who she felt had made
 her so many times his debtor. She was full to overflowing with a sentiment
 of deepest gratitude and affection, that went on widening and deepening as
 she came to know him better and recognize his sterling qualities of head
 and heart, and he, whom she was tending like a little child, was actuated
 by such grateful sentiments that he would have liked to kiss her hands
 each time she gave him a cup of bouillon. Day by day did this bond of
 tender sympathy draw them nearer to each other in that profound solitude
 amid which they lived, harassed by an anxiety that they shared in common.
 When he had utterly exhausted his recollections of the dismal march from
 Rheims to Sedan, to the particulars of which she never seemed to tire of
 listening, the same question always rose to their lips: what was Maurice
 doing then? why did he not write? Could it be that the blockade of Paris
 was already complete, and was that the reason why they received no news?
 They had as yet had but one letter from him, written at Rouen, three days
 after his leaving them, in which he briefly stated that he had reached
 that city on his way to Paris, after a long and devious journey. And then
 for a week there had been no further word; the silence had remained
 unbroken.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the morning, after Doctor Dalichamp had attended to his patient, he
 liked to sit a while and chat, putting his cares aside for the moment.
 Sometimes he also returned at evening and made a longer visit, and it was
 in this way that they learned what was going on in the great world outside
 their peaceful solitude and the terrible calamities that were desolating
 their country. He was their only source of intelligence; his heart, which
 beat with patriotic ardor, overflowed with rage and grief at every fresh
 defeat, and thus it was that his sole topic of conversation was the
 victorious progress of the Prussians, who, since Sedan, had spread
 themselves over France like the waves of some black ocean. Each day
 brought its own tidings of disaster, and resting disconsolately on one of
 the two chairs that stood by the bedside, he would tell in mournful tones
 and with trembling gestures of the increasing gravity of the situation.
 Oftentimes he came with his pockets stuffed with Belgian newspapers, which
 he would leave behind him when he went away. And thus the echoes of
 defeat, days, weeks, after the event, reverberated in that quiet room,
 serving to unite yet more closely in community of sorrow the two poor
 sufferers who were shut within its walls.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was from some of those old newspapers that Henriette read to Jean the
 occurrences at Metz, the Titanic struggle that was three times renewed,
 separated on each occasion by a day's interval. The story was already five
 weeks old, but it was new to him, and he listened with a bleeding heart to
 the repetition of the miserable narrative of defeat to which he was not a
 stranger. In the deathly stillness of the room the incidents of the woeful
 tale unfolded themselves as Henriette, with the sing-song enunciation of a
 schoolgirl, picked out her words and sentences. When, after Froeschwiller
 and Spickeren, the 1st corps, routed and broken into fragments, had swept
 away with it the 5th, the other corps stationed along the frontier <i>en
 echelon</i> from Metz to Bitche, first wavering, then retreating in their
 consternation at those reverses, had ultimately concentrated before the
 intrenched camp on the right bank of the Moselle. But what waste of
 precious time was there, when they should not have lost a moment in
 retreating on Paris, a movement that was presently to be attended with
 such difficulty! The Emperor had been compelled to turn over the supreme
 command to Marshal Bazaine, to whom everyone looked with confidence for a
 victory. Then, on the 14th[*] came the affair of Borny, when the army was
 attacked at the moment when it was at last about to cross the stream,
 having to sustain the onset of two German armies: Steinmetz's, which was
 encamped in observation in front of the intrenched camp, and Prince
 Frederick Charles's, which had passed the river higher up and come down
 along the left bank in order to bar the French from access to their
 country; Borny, where the firing did not begin until it was three o'clock;
 Borny, that barren victory, at the end of which the French remained
 masters of their positions, but which left them astride the Moselle, tied
 hand and foot, while the turning movement of the second German army was
 being successfully accomplished. After that, on the 16th, was the battle
 of Rezonville; all our corps were at last across the stream, although,
 owing to the confusion that prevailed at the junction of the Mars-la-Tour
 and Etain roads, which the Prussians had gained possession of early in the
 morning by a brilliant movement of their cavalry and artillery, the 3d and
 4th corps were hindered in their march and unable to get up; a slow,
 dragging, confused battle, which, up to two o'clock, Bazaine, with only a
 handful of men opposed to him, should have won, but which he wound up by
 losing, thanks to his inexplicable fear of being cut off from Metz; a
 battle of immense extent, spreading over leagues of hill and plain, where
 the French, attacked in front and flank, seemed willing to do almost
 anything except advance, affording the enemy time to concentrate and to
 all appearances co-operating with them to ensure the success of the
 Prussian plan, which was to force their withdrawal to the other side of
 the river. And on the 18th, after their retirement to the intrenched camp,
 Saint-Privat was fought, the culmination of the gigantic struggle, where
 the line of battle extended more than eight miles in length, two hundred
 thousand Germans with seven hundred guns arrayed against a hundred and
 twenty thousand French with but five hundred guns, the Germans facing
 toward Germany, the French toward France, as if invaders and invaded had
 inverted their roles in the singular tactical movements that had been
 going on; after two o'clock the conflict was most sanguinary, the Prussian
 Guard being repulsed with tremendous slaughter and Bazaine, with a left
 wing that withstood the onsets of the enemy like a wall of adamant, for a
 long time victorious, up to the moment, at the approach of evening, when
 the weaker right wing was compelled by the terrific losses it had
 sustained to abandon Saint-Privat, involving in its rout the remainder of
 the army, which, defeated and driven back under the walls of Metz, was
 thenceforth to be imprisoned in a circle of flame and iron.
 </p>
 <p>
 [*] August.&mdash;TR.
 </p>
 <p>
 As Henriette pursued her reading Jean momentarily interrupted her to say:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, well! and to think that we fellows, after leaving Rheims, were
 looking for Bazaine! They were always telling us he was coming; now I can
 see why he never came!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The marshal's despatch, dated the 19th, after the battle of Saint-Privat,
 in which he spoke of resuming his retrograde movement by way of Montmedy,
 that despatch which had for its effect the advance of the army of Chalons,
 would seem to have been nothing more than the report of a defeated
 general, desirous to present matters under their most favorable aspect,
 and it was not until a considerably later period, the 29th, when the
 tidings of the approach of this relieving army had reached him through the
 Prussian lines, that he attempted a final effort, on the right bank this
 time, at Noiseville, but in such a feeble, half-hearted way that on the
 1st of September, the day when the army of Chalons was annihilated at
 Sedan, the army of Metz fell back to advance no more, and became as if
 dead to France. The marshal, whose conduct up to that time may fairly be
 characterized as that of a leader of only moderate ability, neglecting his
 opportunities and failing to move when the roads were open to him, after
 that blockaded by forces greatly superior to his own, was now about to be
 seduced by alluring visions of political greatness and become a
 conspirator and a traitor.
 </p>
 <p>
 But in the papers that Doctor Dalichamp brought them Bazaine was still the
 great man and the gallant soldier, to whom France looked for her
 salvation.
 </p>
 <p>
 And Jean wanted certain passages read to him again, in order that he might
 more clearly understand how it was that while the third German army, under
 the Crown Prince of Prussia, had been leading them such a dance, and the
 first and second were besieging Metz, the latter were so strong in men and
 guns that it had been possible to form from them a fourth army, which,
 under the Crown Prince of Saxony, had done so much to decide the fortune
 of the day at Sedan. Then, having obtained the information he desired,
 resting on that bed of suffering to which his wound condemned him, he
 forced himself to hope in spite of all.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's how it is, you see; we were not so strong as they! No one can ever
 get at the rights of such matters while the fighting is going on. Never
 mind, though; you have read the figures as the newspapers give them:
 Bazaine has a hundred and fifty thousand men with him, he has three
 hundred thousand small arms and more than five hundred pieces of
 artillery; take my word for it, he is not going to let himself be caught
 in such a scrape as we were. The fellows all say he is a tough man to deal
 with; depend on it he's fixing up a nasty dose for the enemy, and he'll
 make 'em swallow it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette nodded her head and appeared to agree with him, in order to keep
 him in a cheerful frame of mind. She could not follow those complicated
 operations of the armies, but had a presentiment of coming, inevitable
 evil. Her voice was fresh and clear; she could have gone on reading thus
 for hours; only too glad to have it in her power to relieve the tedium of
 his long day, though at times, when she came to some narrative of
 slaughter, her eyes would fill with tears that made the words upon the
 printed page a blur. She was doubtless thinking of her husband's fate, how
 he had been shot down at the foot of the wall and his body desecrated by
 the touch of the Bavarian officer's boot.
 </p>
 <p>
 "If it gives you such pain," Jean said in surprise, "you need not read the
 battles; skip them."
 </p>
 <p>
 But, gentle and self-sacrificing as ever, she recovered herself
 immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; don't mind my weakness; I assure you it is a pleasure to me."
 </p>
 <p>
 One evening early in October, when the wind was blowing a small hurricane
 outside, she came in from the ambulance and entered the room with an
 excited air, saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "A letter from Maurice! the doctor just gave it me."
 </p>
 <p>
 With each succeeding morning the twain had been becoming more and more
 alarmed that the young man sent them no word, and now that for a whole
 week it had been rumored everywhere that the investment of Paris was
 complete, they were more disturbed in mind than ever, despairing of
 receiving tidings, asking themselves what could have happened him after he
 left Rouen. And now the reason of the long silence was made clear to them:
 the letter that he had addressed from Paris to Doctor Dalichamp on the
 18th, the very day that ended railway communication with Havre, had gone
 astray and had only reached them at last by a miracle, after a long and
 circuitous journey.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, the dear boy!" said Jean, radiant with delight. "Read it to me,
 quick!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The wind was howling and shrieking more dismally than ever, the window of
 the apartment strained and rattled as if someone were trying to force an
 entrance. Henriette went and got the little lamp, and placing it on the
 table beside the bed applied herself to the reading of the missive, so
 close to Jean that their faces almost touched. There was a sensation of
 warmth and comfort in the peaceful room amid the roaring of the storm that
 raged without.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was a long letter of eight closely filled pages, in which Maurice first
 told how, soon after his arrival on the 16th, he had had the good fortune
 to get into a line regiment that was being recruited up to its full
 strength. Then, reverting to facts of history, he described in brief but
 vigorous terms the principal events of that month of terror: how Paris,
 recovering her sanity in a measure after the madness into which the
 disasters of Wissembourg and Froeschwiller had driven her, had comforted
 herself with hopes of future victories, had cheered herself with fresh
 illusions, such as lying stories of the army's successes, the appointment
 of Bazaine to the chief command, the <i>levee en masse</i>, bogus
 dispatches, which the ministers themselves read from the tribune, telling
 of hecatombs of slaughtered Prussians. And then he went on to tell how, on
 the 3d of September, the thunderbolt had a second time burst over the
 unhappy capital: all hope gone, the misinformed, abused, confiding city
 dazed by that crushing blow of destiny, the cries: "Down with the Empire!"
 that resounded at night upon the boulevards, the brief and gloomy session
 of the Chamber at which Jules Favre read the draft of the bill that
 conceded the popular demand. Then on the next day, the ever-memorable 4th
 of September, was the upheaval of all things, the second Empire swept from
 existence in atonement for its mistakes and crimes, the entire population
 of the capital in the streets, a torrent of humanity a half a million
 strong filling the Place de la Concorde and streaming onward in the bright
 sunshine of that beautiful Sabbath day to the great gates of the Corps
 Legislatif, feebly guarded by a handful of troops, who up-ended their
 muskets in the air in token of sympathy with the populace&mdash;smashing
 in the doors, swarming into the assembly chambers, whence Jules Favre,
 Gambetta and other deputies of the Left were even then on the point of
 departing to proclaim the Republic at the Hotel de Ville; while on the
 Place Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois a little wicket of the Louvre opened
 timidly and gave exit to the Empress-regent, attired in black garments and
 accompanied by a single female friend, both the women trembling with
 affright and striving to conceal themselves in the depths of the public
 cab, which went jolting with its scared inmates from the Tuileries,
 through whose apartments the mob was at that moment streaming. On the same
 day Napoleon III. left the inn at Bouillon, where he had passed his first
 night of exile, bending his way toward Wilhelmshohe.
 </p>
 <p>
 Here Jean, a thoughtful expression on his face, interrupted Henriette.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Then we have a republic now? So much the better, if it is going to help
 us whip the Prussians!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But he shook his head; he had always been taught to look distrustfully on
 republics when he was a peasant. And then, too, it did not seem to him a
 good thing that they should be of differing minds when the enemy was
 fronting them. After all, though, it was manifest there had to be a change
 of some kind, since everyone knew the Empire was rotten to the core and
 the people would have no more of it.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette finished the letter, which concluded with a mention of the
 approach of the German armies. On the 13th, the day when a committee of
 the Government of National Defense had established its quarters at Tours,
 their advanced guards had been seen at Lagny, to the east of Paris. On the
 14th and 15th they were at the very gates of the city, at Creteil and
 Joinville-le-Pont. On the 18th, however, the day when Maurice wrote, he
 seemed to have ceased to believe in the possibility of maintaining a
 strict blockade of Paris; he appeared to be under the influence of one of
 his hot fits of blind confidence, characterising the siege as a senseless
 and impudent enterprise that would come to an ignominious end before they
 were three weeks older, relying on the armies that the provinces would
 surely send to their relief, to say nothing of the army of Metz, that was
 already advancing by way of Verdun and Rheims. And the links of the iron
 chain that their enemies had forged for them had been riveted together; it
 encompassed Paris, and now Paris was a city shut off from all the world,
 whence no letter, no word of tidings longer came, the huge prison-house of
 two millions of living beings, who were to their neighbors as if they were
 not.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette was oppressed by a sense of melancholy. "Ah, merciful heaven!"
 she murmured, "how long will all this last, and shall we ever see him
 more!"
 </p>
 <p>
 A more furious blast bent the sturdy trees out-doors and made the timbers
 of the old farmhouse creak and groan. Think of the sufferings the poor
 fellows would have to endure should the winter be severe, fighting in the
 snow, without bread, without fire!
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bah!" rejoined Jean, "that's a very nice letter of his, and it's a
 comfort to have heard from him. We must not despair."
 </p>
 <p>
 Thus, day by day, the month of October ran its course, with gray
 melancholy skies, and if ever the wind went down for a short space it was
 only to bring the clouds back in darker, heavier masses. Jean's wound was
 healing very slowly; the outflow from the drain was not the "laudable pus"
 which would have permitted the doctor to remove the appliance, and the
 patient was in a very enfeebled state, refusing, however, to be operated
 on in his dread of being left a cripple. An atmosphere of expectant
 resignation, disturbed at times by transient misgivings for which there
 was no apparent cause, pervaded the slumberous little chamber, to which
 the tidings from abroad came in vague, indeterminate shape, like the
 distorted visions of an evil dream. The hateful war, with its butcheries
 and disasters, was still raging out there in the world, in some quarter
 unknown to them, without their ever being able to learn the real course of
 events, without their being conscious of aught save the wails and groans
 that seemed to fill the air from their mangled, bleeding country. And the
 dead leaves rustled in the paths as the wind swept them before it beneath
 the gloomy sky, and over the naked fields brooded a funereal silence,
 broken only by the cawing of the crows, presage of a bitter winter.
 </p>
 <p>
 A principal subject of conversation between them at this time was the
 hospital, which Henriette never left except to come and cheer Jean with
 her company. When she came in at evening he would question her, making the
 acquaintance of each of her charges, desirous to know who would die and
 who recover; while she, whose heart and soul were in her occupation, never
 wearied, but related the occurrences of the day in their minutest details.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah," she would always say, "the poor boys, the poor boys!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not the ambulance of the battlefield, where the blood from the
 wounded came in a fresh, bright stream, where the flesh the surgeon's
 knife cut into was firm and healthy; it was the decay and rottenness of
 the hospital, where the odor of fever and gangrene hung in the air, damp
 with the exhalations of the lingering convalescents and those who were
 dying by inches. Doctor Dalichamp had had the greatest difficulty in
 procuring the necessary beds, sheets and pillows, and every day he had to
 accomplish miracles to keep his patients alive, to obtain for them bread,
 meat and desiccated vegetables, to say nothing of bandages, compresses and
 other appliances. As the Prussian officers in charge of the military
 hospital in Sedan had refused him everything, even chloroform, he was
 accustomed to send to Belgium for what he required. And yet he had made no
 discrimination between French and Germans; he was even then caring for a
 dozen Bavarian soldiers who had been brought in there from Bazeilles.
 Those bitter adversaries who but a short time before had been trying to
 cut each other's throat now lay side by side, their passions calmed by
 suffering. And what abodes of distress and misery they were, those two
 long rooms in the old schoolhouse of Remilly, where, in the crude light
 that streamed through the tall windows, some thirty beds in each were
 arranged on either side of a narrow passage.
 </p>
 <p>
 As late even as ten days after the battle wounded men had been discovered
 in obscure corners, where they had been overlooked, and brought in for
 treatment. There were four who had crawled into a vacant house at Balan
 and remained there, without attendance, kept from starving in some way, no
 one could tell how, probably by the charity of some kind-hearted neighbor,
 and their wounds were alive with maggots; they were as dead men, their
 system poisoned by the corruption that exuded from their wounds. There was
 a purulency, that nothing could check or overcome, that hovered over the
 rows of beds and emptied them. As soon as the door was passed one's
 nostrils were assailed by the odor of mortifying flesh. From drains
 inserted in festering sores fetid matter trickled, drop by drop.
 Oftentimes it became necessary to reopen old wounds in order to extract a
 fragment of bone that had been overlooked. Then abscesses would form, to
 break out after an interval in some remote portion of the body. Their
 strength all gone, reduced to skeletons, with ashen, clayey faces, the
 miserable wretches suffered the torments of the damned. Some, so weakened
 they could scarcely draw their breath, lay all day long upon their back,
 with tight shut, darkened eyes, like corpses in which decomposition had
 already set in; while others, denied the boon of sleep, tossing in
 restless wakefulness, drenched with the cold sweat that streamed from
 every pore, raved like lunatics, as if their suffering had made them mad.
 And whether they were calm or violent, it mattered not; when the contagion
 of the fever reached them, then was the end at hand, the poison doing its
 work, flying from bed to bed, sweeping them all away in one mass of
 corruption.
 </p>
 <p>
 But worst of all was the condemned cell, the room to which were assigned
 those who were attacked by dysentery, typhus or small-pox. There were many
 cases of black small-pox. The patients writhed and shrieked in unceasing
 delirium, or sat erect in bed with the look of specters. Others had
 pneumonia and were wasting beneath the stress of their frightful cough.
 There were others again who maintained a continuous howling and were
 comforted only when their burning, throbbing wound was sprayed with cold
 water. The great hour of the day, the one that was looked forward to with
 eager expectancy, was that of the doctor's morning visit, when the beds
 were opened and aired and an opportunity was afforded their occupants to
 stretch their limbs, cramped by remaining long in one position. And it was
 the hour of dread and terror as well, for not a day passed that, as the
 doctor went his rounds, he was not pained to see on some poor devil's skin
 the bluish spots that denoted the presence of gangrene. The operation
 would be appointed for the following day, when a few more inches of the
 leg or arm would be sliced away. Often the gangrene kept mounting higher
 and higher, and amputation had to be repeated until the entire limb was
 gone.
 </p>
 <p>
 Every evening on her return Henriette answered Jean's questions in the
 same tone of compassion:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, the poor boys, the poor boys!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And her particulars never varied; they were the story of the daily
 recurring torments of that earthly hell. There had been an amputation at
 the shoulder-joint, a foot had been taken off, a humerus resected; but
 would gangrene or purulent contagion be clement and spare the patient? Or
 else they had been burying some one of their inmates, most frequently a
 Frenchman, now and then a German. Scarcely a day passed but a coarse
 coffin, hastily knocked together from four pine boards, left the hospital
 at the twilight hour, accompanied by a single one of the attendants, often
 by the young woman herself, that a fellow-creature might not be laid away
 in his grave like a dog. In the little cemetery at Remilly two trenches
 had been dug, and there they slumbered, side by side, French to the right,
 Germans to the left, their enmity forgotten in their narrow bed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, without ever having seen them, had come to feel an interest in
 certain among the patients. He would ask for tidings of them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And 'Poor boy,' how is he getting on to-day?"
 </p>
 <p>
 This was a little soldier, a private in the 5th of the line, not yet
 twenty years old, who had doubtless enlisted as a volunteer. The by-name:
 "Poor boy" had been given him and had stuck because he always used the
 words in speaking of himself, and when one day he was asked the reason he
 replied that that was the name by which his mother had always called him.
 Poor boy he was, in truth, for he was dying of pleurisy brought on by a
 wound in his left side.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, poor fellow," replied Henriette, who had conceived a special fondness
 for this one of her charges, "he is no better; he coughed all the
 afternoon. It pained my heart to hear him."
 </p>
 <p>
 "And your bear, Gutman, how about him?" pursued Jean, with a faint smile.
 "Is the doctor's report more favorable?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, he thinks he may be able to save his life. But the poor man suffers
 dreadfully."
 </p>
 <p>
 Although they both felt the deepest compassion for him, they never spoke
 of Gutman but a smile of gentle amusement came to their lips. Almost
 immediately upon entering on her duties at the hospital the young woman
 had been shocked to recognize in that Bavarian soldier the features: big
 blue eyes, red hair and beard and massive nose, of the man who had carried
 her away in his arms the day they shot her husband at Bazeilles. He
 recognized her as well, but could not speak; a musket ball, entering at
 the back of the neck, had carried away half his tongue. For two days she
 recoiled with horror, an involuntary shudder passed through her frame,
 each time she had to approach his bed, but presently her heart began to
 melt under the imploring, very gentle looks with which he followed her
 movements in the room. Was he not the blood-splashed monster, with eyes
 ablaze with furious rage, whose memory was ever present to her mind? It
 cost her an effort to recognize him now in that submissive, uncomplaining
 creature, who bore his terrible suffering with such cheerful resignation.
 The nature of his affliction, which is not of frequent occurrence,
 enlisted for him the sympathies of the entire hospital. It was not even
 certain that his name was Gutman; he was called so because the only sound
 he succeeded in articulating was a word of two syllables that resembled
 that more than it did anything else. As regarded all other particulars
 concerning him everyone was in the dark; it was generally believed,
 however, that he was married and had children. He seemed to understand a
 few words of French, for he would answer questions that were put to him
 with an emphatic motion of the head: "Married?" yes, yes! "Children?" yes,
 yes! The interest and excitement he displayed one day that he saw some
 flour induced them to believe he might have been a miller. And that was
 all. Where was the mill, whose wheel had ceased to turn? In what distant
 Bavarian village were the wife and children now weeping their lost husband
 and father? Was he to die, nameless, unknown, in that foreign country, and
 leave his dear ones forever ignorant of his fate?
 </p>
 <p>
 "To-day," Henriette told Jean one evening, "Gutman kissed his hand to me.
 I cannot give him a drink of water, or render him any other trifling
 service, but he manifests his gratitude by the most extravagant
 demonstrations. Don't smile; it is too terrible to be buried thus alive
 before one's time has come."
 </p>
 <p>
 Toward the end of October Jean's condition began to improve. The doctor
 thought he might venture to remove the drain, although he still looked
 apprehensive whenever he examined the wound, which, nevertheless appeared
 to be healing as rapidly as could be expected. The convalescent was able
 to leave his bed, and spent hours at a time pacing his room or seated at
 the window, looking out on the cheerless, leaden sky. Then time began to
 hang heavy on his hands; he spoke of finding something to do, asked if he
 could not be of service on the farm. Among the secret cares that disturbed
 his mind was the question of money, for he did not suppose he could have
 lain there for six long weeks and not exhaust his little fortune of two
 hundred francs, and if Father Fouchard continued to afford him hospitality
 it must be that Henriette had been paying his board. The thought
 distressed him greatly; he did not know how to bring about an explanation
 with her, and it was with a feeling of deep satisfaction that he accepted
 the position of assistant at the farm, with the understanding that he was
 to help Silvine with the housework, while Prosper was to be continued in
 charge of the out-door labors.
 </p>
 <p>
 Notwithstanding the hardness of the times Father Fouchard could well
 afford to take on another hand, for his affairs were prospering. While the
 whole country was in the throes of dissolution and bleeding at every limb,
 he had succeeded in so extending his butchering business that he was now
 slaughtering three and even four times as many animals as he had ever done
 before. It was said that since the 31st of August he had been carrying on
 a most lucrative business with the Prussians. He who on the 30th had stood
 at his door with his cocked gun in his hand and refused to sell a crust of
 bread to the starving soldiers of the 7th corps had on the following day,
 upon the first appearance of the enemy, opened up as dealer in all kinds
 of supplies, had disinterred from his cellar immense stocks of provisions,
 had brought back his flocks and herds from the fastnesses where he had
 concealed them; and since that day he had been one of the heaviest
 purveyors of meat to the German armies, exhibiting consummate address in
 bargaining with them and in getting his money promptly for his
 merchandise. Other dealers at times suffered great inconvenience from the
 insolent arbitrariness of the victors, whereas he never sold them a sack
 of flour, a cask of wine or a quarter of beef that he did not get his pay
 for it as soon as delivered in good hard cash. It made a good deal of talk
 in Remilly; people said it was scandalous on the part of a man whom the
 war had deprived of his only son, whose grave he never visited, but left
 to be cared for by Silvine; but nevertheless they all looked up to him
 with respect as a man who was making his fortune while others, even the
 shrewdest, were having a hard time of it to keep body and soul together.
 And he, with a sly leer out of his small red eyes, would shrug his
 shoulders and growl in his bull-headed way:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who talks of patriotism! I am more a patriot than any of them. Would you
 call it patriotism to fill those bloody Prussians' mouths gratis? What
 they get from me they have to pay for. Folks will see how it is some of
 these days!"
 </p>
 <p>
 On the second day of his employment Jean remained too long on foot, and
 the doctor's secret fears proved not to be unfounded; the wound opened,
 the leg became greatly inflamed and swollen, he was compelled to take to
 his bed again. Dalichamp suspected that the mischief was due to a spicule
 of bone that the two consecutive days of violent exercise had served to
 liberate. He explored the wound and was so fortunate as to find the
 fragment, but there was a shock attending the operation, succeeded by a
 high fever, which exhausted all Jean's strength. He had never in his life
 been reduced to a condition of such debility: his recovery promised to be
 a work of time, and faithful Henriette resumed her position as nurse and
 companion in the little chamber, where winter with icy breath now began to
 make its presence felt. It was early November, already the east wind had
 brought on its wings a smart flurry of snow, and between those four bare
 walls, on the uncarpeted floor where even the tall, gaunt old
 clothes-press seemed to shiver with discomfort, the cold was extreme. As
 there was no fireplace in the room they determined to set up a stove, of
 which the purring, droning murmur assisted to brighten their solitude a
 bit.
 </p>
 <p>
 The days wore on, monotonously, and that first week of the relapse was to
 Jean and Henriette the dreariest and saddest in all their long, unsought
 intimacy. Would their suffering never end? were they to hope for no
 surcease of misery, the danger always springing up afresh? At every moment
 their thoughts sped away to Maurice, from whom they had received no
 further word. They were told that others were getting letters, brief notes
 written on tissue paper and brought in by carrier-pigeons. Doubtless the
 bullet of some hated German had slain the messenger that, winging its way
 through the free air of heaven, was bringing them their missive of joy and
 love. Everything seemed to retire into dim obscurity, to die and be
 swallowed up in the depths of the premature winter. Intelligence of the
 war only reached them a long time after the occurrence of events, the few
 newspapers that Doctor Dalichamp still continued to supply them with were
 often a week old by the time they reached their hands. And their dejection
 was largely owing to their want of information, to what they did not know
 and yet instinctively felt to be the truth, to the prolonged death-wail
 that, spite of all, came to their ears across the frozen fields in the
 deep silence that lay upon the country.
 </p>
 <p>
 One morning the doctor came to them in a condition of deepest
 discouragement. With a trembling hand he drew from his pocket a Belgian
 newspaper and threw it on the bed, exclaiming:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Alas, my friends, poor France is murdered; Bazaine has played the
 traitor!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, who had been dozing, his back supported by a couple of pillows,
 suddenly became wide-awake.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, a traitor?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, he has surrendered Metz and the army. It is the experience of Sedan
 over again, only this time they drain us of our last drop of life-blood."
 Then taking up the paper and reading from it: "One hundred and fifty
 thousand prisoners, one hundred and fifty-three eagles and standards, one
 hundred and forty-one field guns, seventy-six machine guns, eight hundred
 casemate and barbette guns, three hundred thousand muskets, two thousand
 military train wagons, material for eighty-five batteries&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went on giving further particulars: how Marshal Bazaine had been
 blockaded in Metz with the army, bound hand and foot, making no effort to
 break the wall of adamant that surrounded him; the doubtful relations that
 existed between him and Prince Frederick Charles, his indecision and
 fluctuating political combinations, his ambition to play a great role in
 history, but a role that he seemed not to have fixed upon himself; then
 all the dirty business of parleys and conferences, and the communications
 by means of lying, unsavory emissaries with Bismarck, King William and the
 Empress-regent, who in the end put her foot down and refused to negotiate
 with the enemy on the basis of a cession of territory; and, finally, the
 inevitable catastrophe, the completion of the web that destiny had been
 weaving, famine in Metz, a compulsory capitulation, officers and men, hope
 and courage gone, reduced to accept the bitter terms of the victor. France
 no longer had an army.
 </p>
 <p>
 "In God's name!" Jean ejaculated in a deep, low voice. He had not fully
 understood it all, but until then Bazaine had always been for him the
 great captain, the one man to whom they were to look for salvation. "What
 is left us to do now? What will become of them at Paris?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor was just coming to the news from Paris, which was of a
 disastrous character. He called their attention to the fact that the paper
 from which he was reading was dated November 5. The surrender of Metz had
 been consummated on the 27th of October, and the tidings were not known in
 Paris until the 30th. Coming, as it did, upon the heels of the reverses
 recently sustained at Chevilly, Bagneux and la Malmaison, after the
 conflict at Bourget and the loss of that position, the intelligence had
 burst like a thunderbolt over the desperate populace, angered and
 disgusted by the feebleness and impotency of the government of National
 Defense. And thus it was that on the following day, the 31st, the city was
 threatened with a general insurrection, an immense throng of angry men, a
 mob ripe for mischief, collecting on the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, whence
 they swarmed into the halls and public offices, making prisoners the
 members of the Government, whom the National Guard rescued later in the
 day only because they feared the triumph of those incendiaries who were
 clamoring for the commune. And the Belgian journal wound up with a few
 stinging comments on the great City of Paris, thus torn by civil war when
 the enemy was at its gates. Was it not the presage of approaching
 decomposition, the puddle of blood and mire that was to engulf a world?
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's true enough!" said Jean, whose face was very white. "They've no
 business to be squabbling when the Prussians are at hand!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Henriette, who had said nothing as yet, always making it her rule to
 hold her tongue when politics were under discussion, could not restrain a
 cry that rose from her heart. Her thoughts were ever with her brother.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I hope that Maurice, with all the foolish ideas he has
 in his head, won't let himself get mixed up in this business!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They were all silent in their distress; and it was the doctor, who was
 ardently patriotic, who resumed the conversation.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never mind; if there are no more soldiers, others will grow. Metz has
 surrendered, Paris may surrender, even; but it don't follow from that that
 France is wiped out. Yes, the strong-box is all right, as our peasants
 say, and we will live on in spite of all."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was clear, however, that he was hoping against hope. He spoke of the
 army that was collecting on the Loire, whose initial performances, in the
 neighborhood of Arthenay, had not been of the most promising; it would
 become seasoned and would march to the relief of Paris. His enthusiasm was
 aroused to boiling pitch by the proclamations of Gambetta, who had left
 Paris by balloon on the 7th of October and two days later established his
 headquarters at Tours, calling on every citizen to fly to arms, and
 instinct with a spirit at once so virile and so sagacious that the entire
 country gave its adhesion to the dictatorial powers assumed for the public
 safety. And was there not talk of forming another army in the North, and
 yet another in the East, of causing soldiers to spring from the ground by
 sheer force of faith? It was to be the awakening of the provinces, the
 creation of all that was wanting by exercise of indomitable will, the
 determination to continue the struggle until the last sou was spent, the
 last drop of blood shed.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bah!" said the doctor in conclusion as he arose to go, "I have many a
 time given up a patient, and a week later found him as lively as a
 cricket."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean smiled. "Doctor, hurry up and make a well man of me, so I can go back
 to my post down yonder."
 </p>
 <p>
 But those evil tidings left Henriette and him in a terribly disheartened
 state. There came another cold wave, with snow, and when the next day
 Henriette came in shivering from the hospital she told her friend that
 Gutman was dead. The intense cold had proved fatal to many among the
 wounded; it was emptying the rows of beds. The miserable man whom the loss
 of his tongue had condemned to silence had lain two days in the throes of
 death. During his last hour she had remained seated at his bedside, unable
 to resist the supplication of his pleading gaze. He seemed to be speaking
 to her with his tearful eyes, trying to tell, it may be, his real name and
 the name of the village, so far away, where a wife and little ones were
 watching for his return. And he had gone from them a stranger, known of
 none, sending her a last kiss with his uncertain, stiffening fingers, as
 if to thank her once again for all her gentle care. She was the only one
 who accompanied the remains to the cemetery, where the frozen earth, the
 unfriendly soil of the stranger's country, rattled with a dull, hollow
 sound on the pine coffin, mingled with flakes of snow.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next day, again, Henriette said upon her return at evening:
 </p>
 <p>
 "'Poor boy' is dead." She could not keep back her tears at mention of his
 name. "If you could but have seen and heard him in his pitiful delirium!
 He kept calling me: 'Mamma! mamma!' and stretched his poor thin arms out
 to me so entreatingly that I had to take him on my lap. His suffering had
 so wasted him that he was no heavier than a boy of ten, poor fellow. And I
 held and soothed him, so that he might die in peace; yes, I held him in my
 arms, I whom he called his mother and who was but a few years older than
 himself. He wept, and I myself could not restrain my tears; you can see I
 am weeping still&mdash;" Her utterance was choked with sobs; she had to
 pause. "Before his death he murmured several times the name which he had
 given himself: 'Poor boy, poor boy!' Ah, how just the designation! poor
 boys they are indeed, some of them so young and all so brave, whom your
 hateful war maims and mangles and causes to suffer so before they are laid
 away at last in their narrow bed!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Never a day passed now but Henriette came in at night in this anguished
 state, caused by some new death, and the suffering of others had the
 effect of bringing them together even more closely still during the
 sorrowful hours that they spent, secluded from all the world, in the
 silent, tranquil chamber. And yet those hours were full of sweetness, too,
 for affection, a feeling which they believed to be a brother's and
 sister's love, had sprung up in those two hearts which little by little
 had come to know each other's worth. To him, with his observant,
 thoughtful nature, their long intimacy had proved an elevating influence,
 while she, noting his unfailing kindness of heart and evenness of temper,
 had ceased to remember that he was one of the lowly of the earth and had
 been a tiller of the soil before he became a soldier. Their understanding
 was perfect; they made a very good couple, as Silvine said with her grave
 smile. There was never the least embarrassment between them; when she
 dressed his leg the calm serenity that dwelt in the eyes of both was
 undisturbed. Always attired in black, in her widow's garments, it seemed
 almost as if she had ceased to be a woman.
 </p>
 <p>
 But during those long afternoons when Jean was left to himself he could
 not help giving way to speculation. The sentiment he experienced for his
 friend was one of boundless gratitude, a sort of religious reverence,
 which would have made him repel the idea of love as if it were a sort of
 sacrilege. And yet he told himself that had he had a wife like her, so
 gentle, so loving, so helpful, his life would have been an earthly
 paradise. His great misfortune, his unhappy marriage, the evil years he
 had spent at Rognes, his wife's tragic end, all the sad past, arose before
 him with a softened feeling of regret, with an undefined hope for the
 future, but without distinct purpose to try another effort to master
 happiness. He closed his eyes and dropped off into a doze, and then he had
 a confused vision of being at Remilly, married again and owner of a bit of
 land, sufficient to support a family of honest folks whose wants were not
 extravagant. But it was all a dream, lighter than thistle-down; he knew it
 could never, never be. He believed his heart to be capable of no emotion
 stronger than friendship, he loved Henriette as he did solely because he
 was Maurice's brother. And then that vague dream of marriage had come to
 be in some measure a comfort to him, one of those fancies of the
 imagination that we know is never to be realized and with which we fondle
 ourselves in our hours of melancholy.
 </p>
 <p>
 For her part, such thoughts had never for a moment presented themselves to
 Henriette's mind. Since the day of the horrible tragedy at Bazeilles her
 bruised heart had lain numb and lifeless in her bosom, and if consolation
 in the shape of a new affection had found its way thither, it could not be
 otherwise than without her knowledge; the latent movement of the seed
 deep-buried in the earth, which bursts its sheath and germinates, unseen
 of human eye. She failed even to perceive the pleasure it afforded her to
 remain for hours at a time by Jean's bedside, reading to him those
 newspapers that never brought them tidings save of evil. Never had her
 pulses beat more rapidly at the touch of his hand, never had she dwelt in
 dreamy rapture on the vision of the future with a longing to be loved once
 more. And yet it was in that chamber alone that she found comfort and
 oblivion. When she was there, busying herself with noiseless diligence for
 her patient's well-being, she was at peace; it seemed to her that soon her
 brother would return and all would be well, they would all lead a life of
 happiness together and never more be parted. And it appeared to her so
 natural that things should end thus that she talked of their relations
 without the slightest feeling of embarrassment, without once thinking to
 question her heart more closely, unaware that she had already made the
 chaste surrender of it.
 </p>
 <p>
 But as she was on the point of leaving for the hospital one afternoon she
 looked into the kitchen as she passed and saw there a Prussian captain and
 two other officers, and the icy terror that filled her at the sight, then,
 for the first time, opened her eyes to the deep affection she had
 conceived for Jean. It was plain that the men had heard of the wounded
 man's presence at the farm and were come to claim him; he was to be torn
 from them and led away captive to the dungeon of some dark fortress deep
 in Germany. She listened tremblingly, her heart beating tumultuously.
 </p>
 <p>
 The captain, a big, stout man, who spoke French with scarce a trace of
 foreign accent, was rating old Fouchard soundly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Things can't go on in this way; you are not dealing squarely by us. I
 came myself to give you warning, once for all, that if the thing happens
 again I shall take other steps to remedy it; and I promise you the
 consequences will not be agreeable."
 </p>
 <p>
 Though entirely master of all his faculties the old scamp assumed an air
 of consternation, pretending not to understand, his mouth agape, his arms
 describing frantic circles on the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How is that, sir, how is that?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, come, there's no use attempting to pull the wool over my eyes; you
 know perfectly well that the three beeves you sold me on Sunday last were
 rotten&mdash;yes, diseased, and rotten through and through; they must have
 been where there was infection, for they poisoned my men; there are two of
 them in such a bad way that they may be dead by this time for all I know."
 </p>
 <p>
 Fouchard's manner was expressive of virtuous indignation. "What, my cattle
 diseased! why, there's no better meat in all the country; a sick woman
 might feed on it to build her up!" And he whined and sniveled, thumping
 himself on the chest and calling God to witness he was an honest man; he
 would cut off his right hand rather than sell bad meat. For more than
 thirty years he had been known throughout the neighborhood, and not a
 living soul could say he had ever been wronged in weight or quality. "They
 were as sound as a dollar, sir, and if your men had the belly-ache it was
 because they ate too much&mdash;unless some villain hocussed the pot&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And so he ran on, with such a flux of words and absurd theories that
 finally the captain, his patience exhausted, cut him short.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Enough! You have had your warning; see you profit by it! And there is
 another matter: we have our suspicions that all you people of this village
 give aid and comfort to the francs-tireurs of the wood of Dieulet, who
 killed another of our sentries day before yesterday. Mind what I say; be
 careful!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When the Prussians were gone Father Fouchard shrugged his shoulders with a
 contemptuous sneer. Why, yes, of course he sold them carcasses that had
 never been near the slaughter house; that was all they would ever get to
 eat from him. If a peasant had a cow die on his hands of the rinderpest,
 or if he found a dead ox lying in the ditch, was not the carrion good
 enough for those dirty Prussians? To say nothing of the pleasure there was
 in getting a big price out of them for tainted meat at which a dog would
 turn up his nose. He turned and winked slyly at Henriette, who was glad to
 have her fears dispelled, muttering triumphantly:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, little girl, what do you think now of the wicked people who go about
 circulating the story that I am not a patriot? Why don't they do as I do,
 eh? sell the blackguards carrion and put their money in their pocket. Not
 a patriot! why, good Heavens! I shall have killed more of them with my
 diseased cattle than many a soldier with his chassepot!"
 </p>
 <p>
 When the story reached Jean's ears, however, he was greatly disturbed. If
 the German authorities suspected that the people of Remilly were harboring
 the francs-tireurs from Dieulet wood they might at any time come and beat
 up his quarters and unearth him from his retreat. The idea that he should
 be the means of compromising his hosts or bringing trouble to Henriette
 was unendurable to him. Yielding to the young woman's entreaties, however,
 he consented to delay his departure yet for a few days, for his wound was
 very slow in healing and he was not strong enough to go away and join one
 of the regiments in the field, either in the North or on the Loire.
 </p>
 <p>
 From that time forward, up to the middle of December, the stress of their
 anxiety and mental suffering exceeded even what had gone before. The cold
 was grown to be so intense that the stove no longer sufficed to heat the
 great, barn-like room. When they looked from their window on the crust of
 snow that covered the frozen earth they thought of Maurice, entombed down
 yonder in distant Paris, that was now become a city of death and
 desolation, from which they scarcely ever received reliable intelligence.
 Ever the same questions were on their lips: what was he doing, why did he
 not let them hear from him? They dared not voice their dreadful doubts and
 fears; perhaps he was ill, or wounded; perhaps even he was dead. The
 scanty and vague tidings that continued to reach them occasionally through
 the newspapers were not calculated to reassure them. After numerous lying
 reports of successful sorties, circulated one day only to be contradicted
 the next, there was a rumor of a great victory gained by General Ducrot at
 Champigny on the 2d of December; but they speedily learned that on the
 following day the general, abandoning the positions he had won, had been
 forced to recross the Marne and send his troops into cantonments in the
 wood of Vincennes. With each new day the Parisians saw themselves
 subjected to fresh suffering and privation: famine was beginning to make
 itself felt; the authorities, having first requisitioned horned cattle,
 were now doing the same with potatoes, gas was no longer furnished to
 private houses, and soon the fiery flight of the projectiles could be
 traced as they tore through the darkness of the unlighted streets. And so
 it was that neither of them could draw a breath or eat a mouthful without
 being haunted by the image of Maurice and those two million living beings,
 imprisoned in their gigantic sepulcher.
 </p>
 <p>
 From every quarter, moreover, from the northern as well as from the
 central districts, most discouraging advices continued to arrive. In the
 north the 22d army corps, composed of gardes mobiles, depot companies from
 various regiments and such officers and men as had not been involved in
 the disasters of Sedan and Metz, had been forced to abandon Amiens and
 retreat on Arras, and on the 5th of December Rouen had also fallen into
 the hands of the enemy, after a mere pretense of resistance on the part of
 its demoralized, scanty garrison. In the center the victory of Coulmiers,
 achieved on the 3d of November by the army of the Loire, had resuscitated
 for a moment the hopes of the country: Orleans was to be reoccupied, the
 Bavarians were to be put to flight, the movement by way of Etampes was to
 culminate in the relief of Paris; but on December 5 Prince Frederick
 Charles had retaken Orleans and cut in two the army of the Loire, of which
 three corps fell back on Bourges and Vierzon, while the remaining two,
 commanded by General Chanzy, retired to Mans, fighting and falling back
 alternately for a whole week, most gallantly. The Prussians were
 everywhere, at Dijon and at Dieppe, at Vierzon as well as at Mans. And
 almost every morning came the intelligence of some fortified place that
 had capitulated, unable longer to hold out under the bombardment.
 Strasbourg had succumbed as early as the 28th of September, after standing
 forty-six days of siege and thirty-seven of shelling, her walls razed and
 her buildings riddled by more than two hundred thousand projectiles. The
 citadel of Laon had been blown into the air; Toul had surrendered; and
 following them, a melancholy catalogue, came Soissons with its hundred and
 twenty-eight pieces of artillery, Verdun, which numbered a hundred and
 thirty-six, Neufbrisach with a hundred, La Fere with seventy, Montmedy,
 sixty-five. Thionville was in flames, Phalsbourg had only opened her gates
 after a desperate resistance that lasted eighty days. It seemed as if all
 France were doomed to burn and be reduced to ruins by the never-ceasing
 cannonade.
 </p>
 <p>
 One morning that Jean manifested a fixed determination to be gone,
 Henriette seized both his hands and held them tight clasped in hers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, no! I beg you, do not go and leave me here alone. You are not strong
 enough; wait a few days yet, only a few days. I will let you go, I promise
 you I will, whenever the doctor says you are well enough to go and fight."

 <h2>
 V.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The cold was intense on that December evening. Silvine and Prosper,
 together with little Charlot, were alone in the great kitchen of the
 farmhouse, she busy with her sewing, he whittling away at a whip that he
 proposed should be more than usually ornate. It was seven o'clock; they
 had dined at six, not waiting for Father Fouchard, who they supposed had
 been detained at Raucourt, where there was a scarcity of meat, and
 Henriette, whose turn it was to watch that night at the hospital, had just
 left the house, after cautioning Silvine to be sure to replenish Jean's
 stove with coal before she went to bed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Outside a sky of inky blackness overhung the white expanse of snow. No
 sound came from the village, buried among the drifts; all that was to be
 heard in the kitchen was the scraping of Prosper's knife as he fashioned
 elaborate rosettes and lozenges on the dogwood stock. Now and then he
 stopped and cast a glance at Charlot, whose flaxen head was nodding
 drowsily. When the child fell asleep at last the silence seemed more
 profound than ever. The mother noiselessly changed the position of the
 candle that the light might not strike the eyes of her little one; then
 sitting down to her sewing again, she sank into a deep reverie. And
 Prosper, after a further period of hesitation, finally mustered up courage
 to disburden himself of what he wished to say.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen, Silvine; I have something to tell you. I have been watching for
 an opportunity to speak to you in private&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Alarmed by his preface, she raised her eyes and looked him in the face.
 </p>
 <p>
 "This is what it is. You'll forgive me for frightening you, but it is best
 you should be forewarned. In Remilly this morning, at the corner by the
 church, I saw Goliah; I saw him as plain as I see you sitting there. Oh,
 no! there can be no mistake; I was not dreaming!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Her face suddenly became white as death; all she was capable of uttering
 was a stifled moan:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God! my God!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Prosper went on, in words calculated to give her least alarm, and related
 what he had learned during the day by questioning one person and another.
 No one doubted now that Goliah was a spy, that he had formerly come and
 settled in the country with the purpose of acquainting himself with its
 roads, its resources, the most insignificant details pertaining to the
 life of its inhabitants. Men reminded one another of the time when he had
 worked for Father Fouchard on his farm and of his sudden disappearance;
 they spoke of the places he had had subsequently to that over toward
 Beaumont and Raucourt. And now he was back again, holding a position of
 some sort at the military post of Sedan, its duties apparently not very
 well defined, going about from one village to another, denouncing this
 man, fining that, keeping an eye to the filling of the requisitions that
 made the peasants' lives a burden to them. That very morning he had
 frightened the people of Remilly almost out of their wits in relation to a
 delivery of flour, alleging it was short in weight and had not been
 furnished within the specified time.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You are forewarned," said Prosper in conclusion, "and now you'll know
 what to do when he shows his face here&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She interrupted him with a terrified cry.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you think he will come here?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Dame</i>! it appears to me extremely probable he will. It would show
 great lack of curiosity if he didn't, since he knows he has a young one
 here that he has never seen. And then there's you, besides, and you're not
 so very homely but he might like to have another look at you."
 </p>
 <p>
 She gave him an entreating glance that silenced his rude attempt at
 gallantry. Charlot, awakened by the sound of their voices, had raised his
 head. With the blinking eyes of one suddenly aroused from slumber he
 looked about the room, and recalled the words that some idle fellow of the
 village had taught him; and with the solemn gravity of a little man of
 three he announced:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Dey're loafers, de Prussians!"
 </p>
 <p>
 His mother went and caught him frantically in her arms and seated him on
 her lap. Ah! the poor little waif, at once her delight and her despair,
 whom she loved with all her soul and who brought the tears to her eyes
 every time she looked on him, flesh of her flesh, whom it wrung her heart
 to hear the urchins with whom he consorted in the street tauntingly call
 "the little Prussian!" She kissed him, as if she would have forced the
 words back into his mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Who taught my darling such naughty words? It's not nice; you must not say
 them again, my loved one."
 </p>
 <p>
 Whereon Charlot, with the persistency of childhood, laughing and
 squirming, made haste to reiterate:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Dey're dirty loafers, de Prussians!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And when his mother burst into tears he clung about her neck and also
 began to howl dismally. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what new evil was in store for
 her! Was it not enough that she had lost in Honore the one single hope of
 her life, the assured promise of oblivion and future happiness? and was
 that man to appear upon the scene again to make her misery complete?
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come," she murmured, "come along, darling, and go to bed. Mamma will kiss
 her little boy all the same, for he does not know the sorrow he causes
 her."
 </p>
 <p>
 And she went from the room, leaving Prosper alone. The good fellow, not to
 add to her embarrassment, had averted his eyes from her face and was
 apparently devoting his entire attention to his carving.
 </p>
 <p>
 Before putting Charlot to bed it was Silvine's nightly custom to take him
 in to say good-night to Jean, with whom the youngster was on terms of
 great friendship. As she entered the room that evening, holding her candle
 before her, she beheld the convalescent seated upright in bed, his open
 eyes peering into the obscurity. What, was he not asleep? Faith, no; he
 had been ruminating on all sorts of subjects in the silence of the winter
 night; and while she was cramming the stove with coal he frolicked for a
 moment with Charlot, who rolled and tumbled on the bed like a young
 kitten. He knew Silvine's story, and had a very kindly feeling for the
 meek, courageous girl whom misfortune had tried so sorely, mourning the
 only man she had ever loved, her sole comfort that child of shame whose
 existence was a daily reproach to her. When she had replaced the lid on
 the stove, therefore, and came to the bedside to take the boy from his
 arms, he perceived by her red eyes that she had been weeping. What, had
 she been having more trouble? But she would not answer his question: some
 other day she would tell him what it was if it seemed worth the while. <i>Mon
 Dieu!</i> was not her life one of continual suffering now?
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine was at last lugging Charlot away in her arms when there arose from
 the courtyard of the farm a confused sound of steps and voices. Jean
 listened in astonishment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What is it? It can't be Father Fouchard returning, for I did not hear his
 wagon wheels." Lying on his back in his silent chamber, with nothing to
 occupy his mind, he had become acquainted with every detail of the routine
 of home life on the farm, of which the sounds were all familiar to his
 ears. Presently he added: "Ah, I see; it is those men again, the
 francs-tireurs from Dieulet, after something to eat."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Quick, I must be gone!" said Silvine, hurrying from the room and leaving
 him again in darkness. "I must make haste and see they get their loaves."
 </p>
 <p>
 A loud knocking was heard at the kitchen door and Prosper, who was
 beginning to tire of his solitude, was holding a hesitating parley with
 the visitors. He did not like to admit strangers when the master was away,
 fearing he might be held responsible for any damage that might ensue. His
 good luck befriended him in this instance, however, for just then Father
 Fouchard's carriole came lumbering up the acclivity, the tramp of the
 horse's feet resounding faintly on the snow that covered the road. It was
 the old man who welcomed the newcomers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, good! it's you fellows. What have you on that wheelbarrow?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc, lean and hungry as a robber and wrapped in the folds of a blue
 woolen blouse many times too large for him, did not even hear the farmer;
 he was storming angrily at Prosper, his honest brother, as he called him,
 who had only then made up his mind to unbar the door.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, you! do you take us for beggars that you leave us standing in the
 cold in weather such as this?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Prosper did not trouble himself to make any other reply than was
 expressed in a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders, and while he was
 leading the horse off to the stable old Fouchard, bending over the
 wheelbarrow, again spoke up.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So, it's two dead sheep you've brought me. It's lucky it's freezing
 weather, otherwise we should know what they are by the smell."
 </p>
 <p>
 Cabasse and Ducat, Sambuc's two trusty henchmen, who accompanied him in
 all his expeditions, raised their voices in protest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh!" cried the first, with his loud-mouthed Provencal volubility,
 "they've only been dead three days. They're some of the animals that died
 on the Raffins farm, where the disease has been putting in its fine work
 of late."
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Procumbit humi bos</i>," spouted the other, the ex-court officer whose
 excessive predilection for the ladies had got him into difficulties, and
 who was fond of airing his Latin on occasion.
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard shook his head and continued to disparage their
 merchandise, declaring it was too "high." Finally he took the three men
 into the kitchen, where he concluded the business by saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "After all, they'll have to take it and make the best of it. It comes just
 in season, for there's not a cutlet left in Raucourt. When a man's hungry
 he'll eat anything, won't he?" And very well pleased at heart, he called
 to Silvine, who just then came in from putting Charlot to bed: "Let's have
 some glasses; we are going to drink to the downfall of old Bismarck."
 </p>
 <p>
 Fouchard maintained amicable relations with these francs-tireurs from
 Dieulet wood, who for some three months past had been emerging at
 nightfall from the fastnesses where they made their lurking place, killing
 and robbing a Prussian whenever they could steal upon him unawares,
 descending on the farms and plundering the peasants when there was a
 scarcity of the other kind of game. They were the terror of all the
 villages in the vicinity, and the more so that every time a provision
 train was attacked or a sentry murdered the German authorities avenged
 themselves on the adjacent hamlets, the inhabitants of which they accused
 of abetting the outrages, inflicting heavy penalties on them, carrying off
 their mayors as prisoners, burning their poor hovels. Nothing would have
 pleased the peasants more than to deliver Sambuc and his band to the
 enemy, and they were only deterred from doing so by their fear of being
 shot in the back at a turn in the road some night should their attempt
 fail of success.
 </p>
 <p>
 It had occurred to Fouchard to inaugurate a traffic with them. Roaming
 about the country in every direction, peering with their sharp eyes into
 ditches and cattle sheds, they had become his purveyors of dead animals.
 Never an ox or a sheep within a radius of three leagues was stricken down
 by disease but they came by night with their barrow and wheeled it away to
 him, and he paid them in provisions, most generally in bread, that Silvine
 baked in great batches expressly for the purpose. Besides, if he had no
 great love for them, he experienced a secret feeling of admiration for the
 francs-tireurs, a set of handy rascals who went their way and snapped
 their fingers at the world, and although he was making a fortune from his
 dealings with the Prussians, he could never refrain from chuckling to
 himself with grim, savage laughter as often as he heard that one of them
 had been found lying at the roadside with his throat cut.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Your good health!" said he, touching glasses with the three men. Then,
 wiping his mouth with the back of his hand: "Say, have you heard of the
 fuss they're making over the two headless uhlans that they picked up over
 there near Villecourt? Villecourt was burned yesterday, you know; they say
 it was the penalty the village had to pay for harboring you. You'll have
 to be prudent, don't you see, and not show yourselves about here for a
 time. I'll see the bread is sent you somewhere."
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc shrugged his shoulders and laughed contemptuously. What did he care
 for the Prussians, the dirty cowards! And all at once he exploded in a fit
 of anger, pounding the table with his fist.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Tonnerre de Dieu!</i> I don't mind the uhlans so much; they're not so
 bad, but it's the other one I'd like to get a chance at once&mdash;you
 know whom I mean, the other fellow, the spy, the man who used to work for
 you."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Goliah?" said Father Fouchard.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine, who had resumed her sewing, dropped it in her lap and listened
 with intense interest.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That's his name, Goliah! Ah, the brigand! he is as familiar with every
 inch of the wood of Dieulet as I am with my pocket, and he's like enough
 to get us pinched some fine morning. I heard of him to-day at the Maltese
 Cross making his boast that he would settle our business for us before
 we're a week older. A dirty hound, he is, and he served as guide to the
 Prussians the day before the battle of Beaumont; I leave it to these
 fellows if he didn't."
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's as true as there's a candle standing on that table!" attested
 Cabasse.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Per silentia amica lunoe</i>," added Ducat, whose quotations were not
 always conspicuous for their appositeness.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Sambuc again brought his heavy fist down upon the table. "He has been
 tried and adjudged guilty, the scoundrel! If ever you hear of his being in
 the neighborhood just send me word, and his head shall go and keep company
 with the heads of the two uhlans in the Meuse; yes, by G-d! I pledge you
 my word it shall."
 </p>
 <p>
 There was silence. Silvine was very white, and gazed at the men with
 unwinking, staring eyes.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Those are things best not be talked too much about," old Fouchard
 prudently declared. "Your health, and good-night to you."
 </p>
 <p>
 They emptied the second bottle, and Prosper, who had returned from the
 stable, lent a hand to load upon the wheelbarrow, whence the dead sheep
 had been removed, the loaves that Silvine had placed in an old grain-sack.
 But he turned his back and made no reply when his brother and the other
 two men, wheeling the barrow before them through the snow, stalked away
 and were lost to sight in the darkness, repeating:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good-night, good-night! <i>an plaisir</i>!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They had breakfasted the following morning, and Father Fouchard was alone
 in the kitchen when the door was thrown open and Goliah in the flesh
 entered the room, big and burly, with the ruddy hue of health on his face
 and his tranquil smile. If the old man experienced anything in the nature
 of a shock at the suddenness of the apparition he let no evidence of it
 escape him. He peered at the other through his half-closed lids while he
 came forward and shook his former employer warmly by the hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 "How are you, Father Fouchard?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then only the old peasant seemed to recognize him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hallo, my boy, is it you? You've been filling out; how fat you are!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he eyed him from head to foot as he stood there, clad in a sort of
 soldier's greatcoat of coarse blue cloth, with a cap of the same material,
 wearing a comfortable, prosperous air of self-content. His speech betrayed
 no foreign accent, moreover; he spoke with the slow, thick utterance of
 the peasants of the district.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, Father Fouchard, it's I in person. I didn't like to be in the
 neighborhood without dropping in just to say how-do-you-do to you."
 </p>
 <p>
 The old man could not rid himself of a feeling of distrust. What was the
 fellow after, anyway? Could he have heard of the francs-tireurs' visit to
 the farmhouse the night before? That was something he must try to
 ascertain. First of all, however, it would be best to treat him politely,
 as he seemed to have come there in a friendly spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, my lad, since you are so pleasant we'll have a glass together for
 old times' sake."
 </p>
 <p>
 He went himself and got a bottle and two glasses. Such expenditure of wine
 went to his heart, but one must know how to be liberal when he has
 business on hand. The scene of the preceding night was repeated, they
 touched glasses with the same words, the same gestures.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here's to your good health, Father Fouchard."
 </p>
 <p>
 "And here's to yours, my lad."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Goliah unbent and his face assumed an expression of satisfaction; he
 looked about him like a man pleased with the sight of objects that
 recalled bygone times. He did not speak of the past, however, nor, for the
 matter of that, did he speak of the present. The conversation ran on the
 extremely cold weather, which would interfere with farming operations;
 there was one good thing to be said for the snow, however: it would kill
 off the insects. He barely alluded, with a slightly pained expression, to
 the partially concealed hatred, the affright and scorn, with which he had
 been received in the other houses of Remilly. Every man owes allegiance to
 his country, doesn't he? It is quite clear he should serve his country as
 well as he knows how. In France, however, no one looked at the matter in
 that light; there were things about which people had very queer notions.
 And as the old man listened and looked at that broad, innocent,
 good-natured face, beaming with frankness and good-will, he said to
 himself that surely that excellent fellow had had no evil designs in
 coming there.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So you are all alone to-day, Father Fouchard?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, no; Silvine is out at the barn, feeding the cows. Would you like to
 see her?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Goliah laughed. "Well, yes. To be quite frank with you, it was on
 Silvine's account that I came."
 </p>
 <p>
 Old Fouchard felt as if a great load had been taken off his mind; he went
 to the door and shouted at the top of his voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silvine! Silvine! There's someone here to see you."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he went away about his business without further apprehension, since
 the lass was there to look out for the property. A man must be in a bad
 way, he reflected, to let a fancy for a girl keep such a hold on him after
 such a length of time, years and years.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Silvine entered the room she was not surprised to find herself in
 presence of Goliah, who remained seated and contemplated her with his
 broad smile, in which, however, there was a trace of embarrassment. She
 had been expecting him, and stood stock-still immediately she stepped
 across the doorsill, nerving herself and bracing all her faculties. Little
 Charlot came running up and hid among her petticoats, astonished and
 frightened to see a strange man there. Then succeeded a few seconds of
 awkward silence.
 </p>
 <p>
 "And this is the little one, then?" Goliah asked at last in his most
 dulcet tone.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes," was Silvine's curt, stern answer.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silence again settled down upon the room. He had known there was a child,
 although he had gone away before the birth of his offspring, but this was
 the first time he had laid eyes on it. He therefore wished to explain
 matters, like a young man of sense who is confident he can give good
 reasons for his conduct.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, Silvine, I know you cherish bitter feelings against me&mdash;and
 yet there is no reason why you should. If I went away, if I have been
 cause to you of so much suffering, you might have told yourself that
 perhaps it was because I was not my own master. When a man has masters
 over him he must obey them, mustn't he? If they had sent me off on foot to
 make a journey of a hundred leagues I should have been obliged to go. And,
 of course, I couldn't say a word to you about it; you have no idea how bad
 it made me feel to go away as I did without bidding you good-by. I won't
 say to you now that I felt certain I should return to you some day; still,
 I always fully expected that I should, and, as you see, here I am again&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had turned away her head and was looking through the window at the
 snow that carpeted the courtyard, as if resolved to hear no word he said.
 Her persistent silence troubled him; he interrupted his explanations to
 say:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Do you know you are prettier than ever!"
 </p>
 <p>
 True enough, she was very beautiful in her pallor, with her magnificent
 great eyes that illuminated all her face. The heavy coils of raven hair
 that crowned her head seemed the outward symbol of the inward sorrow that
 was gnawing at her heart.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, don't be angry! you know that I mean you no harm. If I did not love
 you still I should not have come back, that's very certain. Now that I am
 here and everything is all right once more we shall see each other now and
 then, shan't we?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She suddenly stepped a pace backward, and looking him squarely in the
 face:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Never!&mdash;and why? Are you not my wife, is not that child ours?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She never once took her eyes from off his face, speaking with impressive
 slowness:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen to me; it will be better to end that matter once for all. You knew
 Honore; I loved him, he was the only man who ever had my love. And now he
 is dead; you robbed me of him, you murdered him over there on the
 battlefield, and never again will I be yours. Never!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She raised her hand aloft as if invoking heaven to record her vow, while
 in her voice was such depth of hatred that for a moment he stood as if
 cowed, then murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, I heard that Honore was dead; he was a very nice young fellow. But
 what could you expect? Many another has died as well; it is the fortune of
 war. And then it seemed to me that once he was dead there would no longer
 be a barrier between us, and let me remind you, Silvine, that after all I
 was never brutal toward you&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 But he stopped short at sight of her agitation; she seemed as if about to
 tear her own flesh in her horror and distress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! that is just it; yes, it is that which seems as if it would drive me
 wild. Why, oh! why did I yield when I never loved you? Honore's departure
 left me so broken down, I was so sick in mind and body that never have I
 been able to recall any portion of the circumstances; perhaps it was
 because you talked to me of him and appeared to love him. My God! the long
 nights I have spent thinking of that time and weeping until the fountain
 of my tears was dry! It is dreadful to have done a thing that one had no
 wish to do and afterward be unable to explain the reason of it. And he had
 forgiven me, he had told me that he would marry me in spite of all when
 his time was out, if those hateful Prussians only let him live. And you
 think I will return to you. No, never, never! not if I were to die for
 it!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Goliah's face grew dark. She had always been so submissive, and now he saw
 she was not to be shaken in her fixed resolve. Notwithstanding his
 easy-going nature he was determined he would have her, even if he should
 be compelled to use force, now that he was in a position to enforce his
 authority, and it was only his inherent prudence, the instinct that
 counseled him to patience and diplomacy, that kept him from resorting to
 violent measures now. The hard-fisted colossus was averse to bringing his
 physical powers into play; he therefore had recourse to another method for
 making her listen to reason.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Very well; since you will have nothing more to do with me I will take
 away the child."
 </p>
 <p>
 "What do you mean?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Charlot, whose presence had thus far been forgotten by them both, had
 remained hanging to his mother's skirts, struggling bravely to keep down
 his rising sobs as the altercation waxed more warm. Goliah, leaving his
 chair, approached the group.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You're my boy, aren't you? You're a good little Prussian. Come along with
 me."
 </p>
 <p>
 But before he could lay hands on the child Silvine, all a-quiver with
 excitement, had thrown her arms about it and clasped it to her bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He, a Prussian, never! He's French, was born in France!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "You say he's French! Look at him, and look at me; he's my very image. Can
 you say he resembles you in any one of his features?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She turned her eyes on the big, strapping lothario, with his curling hair
 and beard and his broad, pink face, in which the great blue eyes gleamed
 like globes of polished porcelain; and it was only too true, the little
 one had the same yellow thatch, the same rounded cheeks, the same light
 eyes; every feature of the hated race was reproduced faithfully in him. A
 tress of her jet black hair that had escaped from its confinement and
 wandered down upon her shoulder in the agitation of the moment showed her
 how little there was in common between the child and her.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I bore him; he is mine!" she screamed in fury. "He's French, and will
 grow up to be a Frenchman, knowing no word of your dirty German language;
 and some day he shall go and help to kill the whole pack of you, to avenge
 those whom you have murdered!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Charlot, tightening his clasp about her neck, began to cry, shrieking:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Mammy, mammy, I'm 'fraid! take me away!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Goliah, doubtless because he did not wish to create a scandal,
 stepped back, and in a harsh, stern voice, unlike anything she had ever
 heard from his lips before, made this declaration:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bear in mind what I am about to tell you, Silvine. I know all that
 happens at this farm. You harbor the francs-tireurs from the wood of
 Dieulet, among them that Sambuc who is brother to your hired man; you
 supply the bandits with provisions. And I know that that hired man,
 Prosper, is a chasseur d'Afrique and a deserter, and belongs to us by
 rights. Further, I know that you are concealing on your premises a wounded
 man, another soldier, whom a word from me would suffice to consign to a
 German fortress. What do you think: am I not well informed?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She was listening to him now, tongue-tied and terror-stricken, while
 little Charlot kept piping in her ear with lisping voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! mammy, mammy, take me away, I'm 'fraid!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come," resumed Goliah, "I'm not a bad fellow, and I don't like quarrels
 and bickering, as you are well aware, but I swear by all that's holy I
 will have them all arrested, Father Fouchard and the rest, unless you
 consent to admit me to your chamber on Monday next. I will take the child,
 too, and send him away to Germany to my mother, who will be very glad to
 have him; for you have no further right to him, you know, if you are going
 to leave me. You understand me, don't you? The folks will all be gone, and
 all I shall have to do will be to come and carry him away. I am the
 master; I can do what pleases me&mdash;come, what have you to say?"
 </p>
 <p>
 But she made no answer, straining the little one more closely to her
 breast as if fearing he might be torn from her then and there, and in her
 great eyes was a look of mingled terror and execration.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is well; I give you three days to think the matter over. See to it
 that your bedroom window that opens on the orchard is left open. If I do
 not find the window open next Monday evening at seven o'clock I will come
 with a detail the following day and arrest the inmates of the house and
 then will return and bear away the little one. Think of it well; <i>au
 revoir</i>, Silvine."
 </p>
 <p>
 He sauntered quietly away, and she remained standing, rooted to her place,
 her head filled with such a swarming, buzzing crowd of terrible thoughts
 that it seemed to her she must go mad. And during the whole of that long
 day the tempest raged in her. At first the thought occurred to her
 instinctively to take her child in her arms and fly with him, wherever
 chance might direct, no matter where; but what would become of them when
 night should fall and envelop them in darkness? how earn a livelihood for
 him and for herself? Then she determined she would speak to Jean, would
 notify Prosper, and Father Fouchard himself, and again she hesitated and
 changed her mind: was she sufficiently certain of the friendship of those
 people that she could be sure they would not sacrifice her to the general
 safety, she who was cause that they were menaced all with such misfortune?
 No, she would say nothing to anyone; she would rely on her own efforts to
 extricate herself from the peril she had incurred by braving that bad man.
 But what scheme could she devise; <i>mon Dieu!</i> how could she avert the
 threatened evil, for her upright nature revolted; she could never have
 forgiven herself had she been the instrument of bringing disaster to so
 many people, to Jean in particular, who had always been so good to
 Charlot.
 </p>
 <p>
 The hours passed, one by one; the next day's sun went down, and still she
 had decided upon nothing. She went about her household duties as usual,
 sweeping the kitchen, attending to the cows, making the soup. No word fell
 from her lips, and rising ever amid the ominous silence she preserved, her
 hatred of Goliah grew with every hour and impregnated her nature with its
 poison. He had been her curse; had it not been for him she would have
 waited for Honore, and Honore would be living now, and she would be happy.
 Think of his tone and manner when he made her understand he was the
 master! He had told her the truth, moreover; there were no longer
 gendarmes or judges to whom she could apply for protection; might made
 right. Oh, to be the stronger! to seize and overpower him when he came, he
 who talked of seizing others! All she considered was the child, flesh of
 her flesh; the chance-met father was naught, never had been aught, to her.
 She had no particle of wifely feeling toward him, only a sentiment of
 concentrated rage, the deep-seated hatred of the vanquished for the
 victor, when she thought of him. Rather than surrender the child to him
 she would have killed it, and killed herself afterward. And as she had
 told him, the child he had left her as a gift of hate she would have
 wished were already grown and capable of defending her; she looked into
 the future and beheld him with a musket, slaughtering hecatombs of
 Prussians. Ah, yes! one Frenchman more to assist in wreaking vengeance on
 the hereditary foe!
 </p>
 <p>
 There was but one day remaining, however; she could not afford to waste
 more time in arriving at a decision. At the very outset, indeed, a hideous
 project had presented itself among the whirling thoughts that filled her
 poor, disordered mind: to notify the francs-tireurs, to give Sambuc the
 information he desired so eagerly; but the idea had not then assumed
 definite form and shape, and she had put it from her as too atrocious, not
 suffering herself even to consider it: was not that man the father of her
 child? she could not be accessory to his murder. Then the thought
 returned, and kept returning at more frequently recurring intervals,
 little by little forcing itself upon her and enfolding her in its unholy
 influence; and now it had entire possession of her, holding her captive by
 the strength of its simple and unanswerable logic. The peril and calamity
 that overhung them all would vanish with that man; he in his grave, Jean,
 Prosper, Father Fouchard would have nothing more to fear, while she
 herself would retain possession of Charlot and there would be never a one
 in all the world to challenge her right to him. All that day she turned
 and re-turned the project in her mind, devoid of further strength to bid
 it down, considering despite herself the murder in its different aspects,
 planning and arranging its most minute details. And now it was become the
 one fixed, dominant idea, making a portion of her being, that she no
 longer stopped to reason on, and when finally she came to act, in
 obedience to that dictate of the inevitable, she went forward as in a
 dream, subject to the volition of another, a someone within her whose
 presence she had never known till then.
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard had taken alarm, and on Sunday he dispatched a messenger
 to the francs-tireurs to inform them that their supply of bread would be
 forwarded to the quarries of Boisville, a lonely spot a mile and a quarter
 from the house, and as Prosper had other work to do the old man sent
 Silvine with the wheelbarrow. It was manifest to the young woman that
 Destiny had taken the matter in its hands; she spoke, she made an
 appointment with Sambuc for the following evening, and there was no tremor
 in her voice, as if she were pursuing a course marked out for her from
 which she could not depart. The next day there were still other signs
 which proved that not only sentient beings, but inanimate objects as well,
 favored the crime. In the first place Father Fouchard was called suddenly
 away to Raucourt, and knowing he could not get back until after eight
 o'clock, instructed them not to wait dinner for him. Then Henriette, whose
 night off it was, received word from the hospital late in the afternoon
 that the nurse whose turn it was to watch was ill and she would have to
 take her place; and as Jean never left his chamber under any
 circumstances, the only remaining person from whom interference was to be
 feared was Prosper. It revolted the chasseur d'Afrique, the idea of
 killing a man that way, three against one, but when his brother arrived,
 accompanied by his faithful myrmidons, the disgust he felt for the
 villainous crew was lost in his detestation of the Prussians; sure he
 wasn't going to put himself out to save one of the dirty hounds, even if
 they did do him up in a way that was not according to rule; and he settled
 matters with his conscience by going to bed and burying his head under the
 blankets, that he might hear nothing that would tempt him to act in
 accordance with his soldierly instincts.
 </p>
 <p>
 It lacked a quarter of seven, and Charlot seemed determined not to go to
 sleep. As a general thing his head declined upon the table the moment he
 had swallowed his last mouthful of soup.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Come, my darling, go to sleep," said Silvine, who had taken him to
 Henriette's room; "mamma has put you in the nice lady's big bed."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the child was excited by the novelty of the situation; he kicked and
 sprawled upon the bed, bubbling with laughter and animal spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no&mdash;stay, little mother&mdash;play, little mother."
 </p>
 <p>
 She was very gentle and patient, caressing him tenderly and repeating:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Go to sleep, my darling; shut your eyes and go to sleep, to please
 mamma."
 </p>
 <p>
 And finally slumber overtook him, with a happy laugh upon his lips. She
 had not taken the trouble to undress him; she covered him warmly and left
 the room, and so soundly was he in the habit of sleeping that she did not
 even think it necessary to turn the key in the door.
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine had never known herself to be so calm, so clear and alert of mind.
 Her decision was prompt, her movements were light, as if she had parted
 company with her material frame and were acting under the domination of
 that other self, that inner being which she had never known till then. She
 had already let in Sambuc, with Cabasse and Ducat, enjoining upon them the
 exercise of the strictest caution, and now she conducted them to her
 bedroom and posted them on either side the window, which she threw open
 wide, notwithstanding the intense cold. The darkness was profound; barely
 a faint glimmer of light penetrated the room, reflected from the bosom of
 the snow without. A deathlike stillness lay on the deserted fields, the
 minutes lagged interminably. Then, when at last the deadened sound was
 heard of footsteps drawing near, Silvine withdrew and returned to the
 kitchen, where she seated herself and waited, motionless as a corpse, her
 great eyes fixed on the flickering flame of the solitary candle.
 </p>
 <p>
 And the suspense was long protracted, Goliah prowling warily about the
 house before he would risk entering. He thought he could depend on the
 young woman, and had therefore come unarmed save for a single revolver in
 his belt, but he was haunted by a dim presentiment of evil; he pushed open
 the window to its entire extent and thrust his head into the apartment,
 calling below his breath:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silvine! Silvine!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Since he found the window open to him it must be that she had thought
 better of the matter and changed her mind. It gave him great pleasure to
 have it so, although he would rather she had been there to welcome him and
 reassure his fears. Doubtless Father Fouchard had summoned her away; some
 odds and ends of work to finish up. He raised his voice a little:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silvine! Silvine!"
 </p>
 <p>
 No answer, not a sound. And he threw his leg over the window-sill and
 entered the room, intending to get into bed and snuggle away among the
 blankets while waiting, it was so bitter cold.
 </p>
 <p>
 All at once there was a furious rush, with the noise of trampling,
 shuffling feet, and smothered oaths and the sound of labored breathing.
 Sambuc and his two companions had thrown themselves on Goliah, and
 notwithstanding their superiority in numbers they found it no easy task to
 overpower the giant, to whom his peril lent tenfold strength. The panting
 of the combatants, the straining of sinews and cracking of joints,
 resounded for a moment in the obscurity. The revolver, fortunately, had
 fallen to the floor in the struggle. Cabasse's choking, inarticulate voice
 was heard exclaiming: "The cords, the cords!" and Ducat handed to Sambuc
 the coil of thin rope with which they had had the foresight to provide
 themselves. Scant ceremony was displayed in binding their hapless victim;
 the operation was conducted to the accompaniment of kicks and cuffs. The
 legs were secured first, then the arms were firmly pinioned to the sides,
 and finally they wound the cord at random many times around the Prussian's
 body, wherever his contortions would allow them to place it, with such an
 affluence of loops and knots that he had the appearance of being enmeshed
 in a gigantic net. To his unintermitting outcries Ducat's voice responded:
 "Shut your jaw!" and Cabasse silenced him more effectually by gagging him
 with an old blue handkerchief. Then, first waiting a moment to get their
 breath, they carried him, an inert mass, to the kitchen and deposited him
 upon the big table, beside the candle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, the Prussian scum!" exclaimed Sambuc, wiping the sweat from his
 forehead, "he gave us trouble enough! Say, Silvine, light another candle,
 will you, so we can get a good view of the d&mdash;&mdash;d pig and see
 what he looks like."
 </p>
 <p>
 Silvine arose, her wide-dilated eyes shining bright from out her colorless
 face. She spoke no word, but lit another candle and came and placed it by
 Goliah's head on the side opposite the other; he produced the effect, thus
 brilliantly illuminated, of a corpse between two mortuary tapers. And in
 that brief moment their glances met; his was the wild, agonized look of
 the supplicant whom his fears have overmastered, but she affected not to
 understand, and withdrew to the sideboard, where she remained standing
 with her icy, unyielding air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The beast has nearly chewed my finger off," growled Cabasse, from whose
 hand blood was trickling. "I'm going to spoil his ugly mug for him."
 </p>
 <p>
 He had taken the revolver from the floor and was holding it poised by the
 barrel in readiness to strike, when Sambuc disarmed him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no! none of that. We are not murderers, we francs-tireurs; we are
 judges. Do you hear, you dirty Prussian? we're going to try you; and you
 need have no fear, your rights shall be respected. We can't let you speak
 in your own defense, for if we should unmuzzle you you would split our
 ears with your bellowing, but I'll see that you have a lawyer presently,
 and a famous good one, too!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He went and got three chairs and placed them in a row, forming what it
 pleased him to call the court, he sitting in the middle with one of his
 followers on either hand. When all three were seated he arose and
 commenced to speak, at first ironically aping the gravity of the
 magistrate, but soon launching into a tirade of blood-thirsty invective.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I have the honor to be at the same time President of the Court and Public
 Prosecutor. That, I am aware, is not strictly in order, but there are not
 enough of us to fill all the roles. I accuse you, therefore, of entering
 France to play the spy on us, recompensing us for our hospitality with the
 most abominable treason. It is to you to whom we are principally indebted
 for our recent disasters, for after the battle of Nouart you guided the
 Bavarians across the wood of Dieulet by night to Beaumont. No one but a
 man who had lived a long time in the country and was acquainted with every
 path and cross-road could have done it, and on this point the conviction
 of the court is unalterable; you were seen conducting the enemy's
 artillery over roads that had become lakes of liquid mud, where eight
 horses had to be hitched to a single gun to drag it out of the slough. A
 person looking at those roads would hesitate to believe that an army corps
 could ever have passed over them. Had it not been for you and your
 criminal action in settling among us and betraying us the surprise of
 Beaumont would have never been, we should not have been compelled to
 retreat on Sedan, and perhaps in the end we might have come off
 victorious. I will say nothing of the disgusting career you have been
 pursuing since then, coming here in disguise, terrorizing and denouncing
 the poor country people, so that they tremble at the mention of your name.
 You have descended to a depth of depravity beyond which it is impossible
 to go, and I demand from the court sentence of death."
 </p>
 <p>
 Silence prevailed in the room. He had resumed his seat, and finally,
 rising again, said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I assign Ducat to you as counsel for the defense. He has been sheriff's
 officer, and might have made his mark had it not been for his little
 weakness. You see that I deny you nothing; we are disposed to treat you
 well."
 </p>
 <p>
 Goliah, who could not stir a finger, bent his eyes on his improvised
 defender. It was in his eyes alone that evidence of life remained, eyes
 that burned intensely with ardent supplication under the ashy brow, where
 the sweat of anguish stood in big drops, notwithstanding the cold.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ducat arose and commenced his plea. "Gentlemen, my client, to tell the
 truth, is the most noisome blackguard that I ever came across in my life,
 and I should not have been willing to appear in his defense had I not a
 mitigating circumstance to plead, to wit: they are all that way in the
 country he came from. Look at him closely; you will read his astonishment
 in his eyes; he does not understand the gravity of his offense. Here in
 France we may employ spies, but no one would touch one of them unless with
 a pair of pincers, while in that country espionage is considered a highly
 honorable career and an extremely meritorious manner of serving the state.
 I will even go so far as to say, gentlemen, that possibly they are not
 wrong; our noble sentiments do us honor, but they have also the
 disadvantage of bringing us defeat. If I may venture to speak in the
 language of Cicero and Virgil, <i>quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat</i>.
 You will understand the allusion, gentlemen."
 </p>
 <p>
 And he took his seat again, while Sambuc resumed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "And you, Cabasse, have you nothing to say either for or against the
 defendant?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "All I have to say," shouted the Provencal, "is that we are wasting a deal
 of breath in settling that scoundrel's hash. I've had my little troubles
 in my lifetime, and plenty of 'em, but I don't like to see people trifle
 with the affairs of the law; it's unlucky. Let him die, I say!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc rose to his feet with an air of profound gravity.
 </p>
 <p>
 "This you both declare to be your verdict, then&mdash;death?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes! death!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The chairs were pushed back, he advanced to the table where Goliah lay,
 saying:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You have been tried and sentenced; you are to die."
 </p>
 <p>
 The flame of the two candles rose about their unsnuffed wicks and
 flickered in the draught, casting a fitful, ghastly light on Goliah's
 distorted features. The fierce efforts he made to scream for mercy, to
 vociferate the words that were strangling him, were such that the
 handkerchief knotted across his mouth was drenched with spume, and it was
 a sight most horrible to see, that strong man reduced to silence,
 voiceless already as a corpse, about to die with that torrent of excuse
 and entreaty pent in his bosom.
 </p>
 <p>
 Cabasse cocked the revolver. "Shall I let him have it?" he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no!" Sambuc shouted in reply; "he would be only too glad." And
 turning to Goliah: "You are not a soldier; you are not worthy of the honor
 of quitting the world with a bullet in your head. No, you shall die the
 death of a spy and the dirty pig that you are."
 </p>
 <p>
 He looked over his shoulder and politely said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silvine, if it's not troubling you too much, I would like to have a tub."
 </p>
 <p>
 During the whole of the trial scene Silvine had not moved a muscle. She
 had stood in an attitude of waiting, with drawn, rigid features, as if
 mind and body had parted company, conscious of nothing but the one fixed
 idea that had possessed her for the last two days. And when she was asked
 for a tub she received the request as a matter of course and proceeded at
 once to comply with it, disappearing into the adjoining shed, whence she
 returned with the big tub in which she washed Charlot's linen.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hold on a minute! place it under the table, close to the edge."
 </p>
 <p>
 She placed the vessel as directed, and as she rose to her feet her eyes
 again encountered Goliah's. In the look of the poor wretch was a supreme
 prayer for mercy, the revolt of the man who cannot bear the thought of
 being stricken down in the pride of his strength. But in that moment there
 was nothing of the woman left in her; nothing but the fierce desire for
 that death for which she had been waiting as a deliverance. She retreated
 again to the buffet, where she remained standing in silent expectation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sambuc opened the drawer of the table and took from it a large kitchen
 knife, the one that the household employed to slice their bacon.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So, then, as you are a pig, I am going to stick you like a pig."
 </p>
 <p>
 He proceeded in a very leisurely manner, discussing with Cabasse, and
 Ducat the proper method of conducting the operation. They even came near
 quarreling, because Cabasse alleged that in Provence, the country he came
 from, they hung pigs up by the heels to stick them, at which Ducat
 expressed great indignation, declaring that the method was a barbarous and
 inconvenient one.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bring him well forward to the edge of the table, his head over the tub,
 so as to avoid soiling the floor."
 </p>
 <p>
 They drew him forward, and Sambuc went about his task in a tranquil,
 decent manner. With a single stroke of the keen knife he slit the throat
 crosswise from ear to ear, and immediately the blood from the severed
 carotid artery commenced to drip, drip into the tub with the gentle
 plashing of a fountain. He had taken care not to make the incision too
 deep; only a few drops spurted from the wound, impelled by the action of
 the heart. Death was the slower in coming for that, but no convulsion was
 to be seen, for the cords were strong and the body was utterly incapable
 of motion. There was no death-rattle, not a quiver of the frame. On the
 face alone was evidence of the supreme agony, on that terror-distorted
 mask whence the blood retreated drop by drop, leaving the skin colorless,
 with a whiteness like that of linen. The expression faded from the eyes;
 they became dim, the light died from out them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Say, Silvine, we shall want a sponge, too."
 </p>
 <p>
 She made no reply, standing riveted to the floor in an attitude of
 unconsciousness, her arms folded tightly across her bosom, her throat
 constricted as by the clutch of a mailed hand, gazing on the horrible
 spectacle. Then all at once she perceived that Charlot was there, grasping
 her skirts with his little hands; he must have awaked and managed to open
 the intervening doors, and no one had seen him come stealing in,
 childlike, curious to know what was going on. How long had he been there,
 half-concealed behind his mother? From beneath his shock of yellow hair
 his big blue eyes were fixed on the trickling blood, the thin red stream
 that little by little was filling the tub. Perhaps he had not understood
 at first and had found something diverting in the sight, but suddenly he
 seemed to become instinctively aware of all the abomination of the thing;
 he gave utterance to a sharp, startled cry:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, mammy! oh, mammy! I'm 'fraid, take me away!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It gave Silvine a shock, so violent that it convulsed her in every fiber
 of her being. It was the last straw; something seemed to give way in her,
 the excitement that had sustained her for the last two days while under
 the domination of her one fixed idea gave way to horror. It was the
 resurrection of the dormant woman in her; she burst into tears, and with a
 frenzied movement caught Charlot up and pressed him wildly to her heart.
 And she fled with him, running with distracted terror, unable to see or
 hear more, conscious of but one overmastering need, to find some secret
 spot, it mattered not where, in which she might cast herself upon the
 ground and seek oblivion.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was at this crisis that Jean rose from his bed and, softly opening his
 door, looked out into the passage. Although he generally gave but small
 attention to the various noises that reached him from the farmhouse, the
 unusual activity that prevailed this evening, the trampling of feet, the
 shouts and cries, in the end excited his curiosity. And it was to the
 retirement of his sequestered chamber that Silvine, sobbing and
 disheveled, came for shelter, her form convulsed by such a storm of
 anguish that at first he could not grasp the meaning of the rambling,
 inarticulate words that fell from her blanched lips. She kept constantly
 repeating the same terrified gesture, as if to thrust from before her eyes
 some hideous, haunting vision. At last he understood, the entire
 abominable scene was pictured clearly to his mind: the traitorous ambush,
 the slaughter, the mother, her little one clinging to her skirts, watching
 unmoved the murdered father, whose life-blood was slowly ebbing; and it
 froze his marrow&mdash;the peasant and the soldier was sick at heart with
 anguished horror. Ah, hateful, cruel war! that changed all those poor
 folks to ravening wolves, bespattering the child with the father's blood!
 An accursed sowing, to end in a harvest of blood and tears!
 </p>
 <p>
 Resting on the chair where she had fallen, covering with frantic kisses
 little Charlot, who clung, sobbing, to her bosom, Silvine repeated again
 and again the one unvarying phrase, the cry of her bleeding heart.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my poor child, they will no more say you are a Prussian! Ah, my poor
 child, they will no more say you are a Prussian!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Meantime Father Fouchard had returned and was in the kitchen. He had come
 hammering at the door with the authority of the master, and there was
 nothing left to do but open to him. The surprise he experienced was not
 exactly an agreeable one on beholding the dead man outstretched on his
 table and the blood-filled tub beneath. It followed naturally, his
 disposition not being of the mildest, that he was very angry.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You pack of rascally slovens! say, couldn't you have gone outdoors to do
 your dirty work? Do you take my place for a shambles, eh? coming here and
 ruining the furniture with such goings-on?" Then, as Sambuc endeavored to
 mollify him and explain matters, the old fellow went on with a violence
 that was enhanced by his fears: "And what do you suppose I am to do with
 the carcass, pray? Do you consider it a gentlemanly thing to do, to come
 to a man's house like this and foist a stiff off on him without so much as
 saying by your leave? Suppose a patrol should come along, what a nice fix
 I should be in! but precious little you fellows care whether I get my neck
 stretched or not. Now listen: do you take that body at once and carry it
 away from here; if you don't, by G-d, you and I will have a settlement!
 You hear me; take it by the head, take it by the heels, take it any way
 you please, but get it out of here and don't let there be a hair of it
 remaining in this room at the end of three minutes from now!"
 </p>
 <p>
 In the end Sambuc prevailed on Father Fouchard to let him have a sack,
 although it wrung the old miser's heartstrings to part with it. He
 selected one that was full of holes, remarking that anything was good
 enough for a Prussian. Cabasse and Ducat had all the trouble in the world
 to get Goliah into it; it was too short and too narrow for the long, broad
 body, and the feet protruded at its mouth. Then they carried their burden
 outside and placed it on the wheelbarrow that had served to convey to them
 their bread.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You'll not be troubled with him any more, I give you my word of honor!"
 declared Sambuc. "We'll go and toss him into the Meuse."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Be sure and fasten a couple of big stones to his feet," recommended
 Fouchard, "so the lubber shan't come up again."
 </p>
 <p>
 And the little procession, dimly outlined against the white waste of snow,
 started and soon was buried in the blackness of the night, giving no sound
 save the faint, plaintive creaking of the barrow.
 </p>
 <p>
 In after days Sambuc swore by all that was good and holy he had obeyed the
 old man's directions, but none the less the corpse came to the surface and
 was discovered two days afterward by the Prussians among the weeds at
 Pont-Maugis, and when they saw the manner of their countryman's murder,
 his throat slit like a pig, their wrath and fury knew no bounds. Their
 threats were terrible, and were accompanied by domiciliary visits and
 annoyances of every kind. Some of the villagers must have blabbed, for
 there came a party one night and arrested Father Fouchard and the Mayor of
 Remilly on the charge of giving aid and comfort to the francs-tireurs, who
 were manifestly the perpetrators of the crime. And Father Fouchard really
 came out very strong under those untoward circumstances, exhibiting all
 the impassability of a shrewd old peasant, who knew the value of silence
 and a tranquil demeanor. He went with his captors without the least sign
 of perturbation, without even asking them for an explanation. The truth
 would come out. In the country roundabout it was whispered that he had
 already made an enormous fortune from the Prussians, sacks and sacks of
 gold pieces, that he buried away somewhere, one by one, as he received
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 All these stories were a terrible source of alarm to Henriette when she
 came to hear of them. Jean, fearing he might endanger the safety of his
 hosts, was again eager to get away, although the doctor declared he was
 still too weak, and she, saddened by the prospect of their approaching
 separation, insisted on his delaying his departure for two weeks. At the
 time of Father Fouchard's arrest Jean had escaped a like fate by hiding in
 the barn, but he was liable to be taken and led away captive at any moment
 should there be further searches made. She was also anxious as to her
 uncle's fate, and so she resolved one morning to go to Sedan and see the
 Delaherches, who had, it was said, a Prussian officer of great influence
 quartered in their house.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Silvine," she said, as she was about to start, "take good care of our
 patient; see he has his bouillon at noon and his medicine at four
 o'clock."
 </p>
 <p>
 The maid of all work, ever busy with her daily recurring tasks, was again
 the submissive and courageous woman she had been of old; she had the care
 of the farm now, moreover, in the absence of the master, while little
 Charlot was constantly at her heels, frisking and gamboling around her.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Have no fear, madame, he shall want for nothing. I am here and will look
 out for him."

 <h2>
 VI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Life had fallen back into something like its accustomed routine with the
 Delaherches at their house in the Rue Maqua after the terrible shock of
 the capitulation, and for nearly four months the long days had been slowly
 slipping by under the depressing influence of the Prussian occupation.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was one corner, however, of the immense structure that was always
 closed, as if it had no occupant: it was the chamber that Colonel de
 Vineuil still continued to inhabit, at the extreme end of the suite where
 the master and his family spent their daily life. While the other windows
 were thrown open, affording evidence by sight and sound of the activity
 that prevailed within, those of that room were dark and lifeless, their
 blinds invariably drawn. The colonel had complained that the daylight hurt
 his eyes; no one knew whether or not this was strictly true, but a lamp
 was kept burning at his bedside day and night to humor him in his fancy.
 For two long months he had kept his bed, although Major Bouroche asserted
 there was nothing more serious than a contusion of the ankle and a
 fragment of bone chipped away; the wound refused to heal and complications
 of various kinds had ensued. He was able to get up now, but was in such a
 state of utter mental prostration, his mysterious ailment had taken such
 firm hold upon his system, that he was content to spend his days in
 idleness, stretched on a lounge before a great wood fire. He had wasted
 away until he was little more than a shadow, and still the physician who
 was attending him could find no lesion to account for that lingering
 death. He was slowly fading away, like the flame of a lamp in which the
 supply of oil is giving out.
 </p>
 <p>
 Mme. Delaherche, the mother, had immured herself there with him on the day
 succeeding the occupation. No doubt they understood each other, and had
 expressed in two words, once for all, their common purpose to seclude
 themselves in that apartment so long as there should be Prussians
 quartered in the house. They had afforded compulsory hospitality to many
 of the enemy for various lengths of time; one, a Captain, M. Gartlauben,
 was there still, had taken up his abode with them permanently. But never
 since that first day had mention of those things passed the colonel's and
 the old lady's lips. Notwithstanding her seventy-eight years she was up
 every morning soon as it was day and came and took her position in the
 fauteuil that was awaiting her in the chimney nook opposite her old
 friend. There, by the steady, tranquil lamplight, she applied herself
 industriously to knitting socks for the children of the poor, while he,
 his eyes fixed on the crumbling brands, with no occupation for body or
 mind, was as one already dead, in a state of constantly increasing stupor.
 They certainly did not exchange twenty words in the course of a day;
 whenever she, who still continued to go about the house at intervals,
 involuntarily allowed some bit of news from the outer world to escape her
 lips, he silenced her with a gesture, so that no tidings of the siege of
 Paris, the disasters on the Loire and all the daily renewed horrors of the
 invasion had gained admission there. But the colonel might stop his ears
 and shut out the light of day as he would in his self-appointed tomb; the
 air he breathed must have brought him through key-hole and crevices
 intelligence of the calamity that was everywhere throughout the land, for
 every new day beheld him sinking, slowly dying, despite his determination
 not to know the evil news.
 </p>
 <p>
 While matters were in this condition at one end of the house Delaherche,
 who was never contented unless occupied, was bustling about and making
 attempts to start up his business once more, but what with the disordered
 condition of the labor market and the pecuniary embarrassment of many
 among his customers, he had so far only put a few looms in motion. Then it
 occurred to him, as a means of killing the time that hung heavy on his
 hands, to make a complete inventory of his business and perfect certain
 changes and improvements that he had long had in mind. To assist him in
 his labors he had just then at his disposal a young man, the son of an old
 business acquaintance, who had drifted in on him after the battle. Edmond
 Lagarde, who, although he was twenty-three years old, would not have been
 taken for more than eighteen, had grown to man's estate in his father's
 little dry-goods shop at Passy; he was a sergeant in the 5th line regiment
 and had fought with great bravery throughout the campaign, so much so that
 he had been knocked over near the Minil gate about five o'clock, when the
 battle was virtually ended, his left arm shattered by one of the last
 shots fired that day, and Delaherche, when the other wounded were removed
 from the improvised ambulance in the drying room, had good-naturedly
 received him as an inmate of his house. It was under these circumstances
 that Edmond was now one of the family, having an apartment in the house
 and taking his meals at the common table, and, now that his wound was
 healed, acting as a sort of secretary to the manufacturer while waiting
 for a chance to get back to Paris. He had signed a parole binding himself
 not to attempt to leave the city, and owing to this and to his protector's
 influence the Prussian authorities did not interfere with him. He was
 fair, with blue eyes, and pretty as a woman; so timid withal that his face
 assumed a beautiful hue of rosy red whenever anyone spoke to him. He had
 been his mother's darling; she had impoverished herself, expending all the
 profits of their little business to send him to college. And he adored
 Paris and bewailed his compulsory absence from it when talking to
 Gilberte, did this wounded cherub, whom the young woman had displayed
 great good-fellowship in nursing.
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally, their household had received another addition in the person of M.
 de Gartlauben, a captain in the German landwehr, whose regiment had been
 sent to Sedan to supply the place of troops dispatched to service in the
 field. He was a personage of importance, notwithstanding his comparatively
 modest rank, for he was nephew to the governor-general, who, from his
 headquarters at Rheims, exercised unlimited power over all the district.
 He, too, prided himself on having lived at Paris, and seized every
 occasion ostentatiously to show he was not ignorant of its pleasures and
 refinements; concealing beneath this film of varnish his inborn rusticity,
 he assumed as well as he was able the polish of one accustomed to good
 society. His tall, portly form was always tightly buttoned in a
 close-fitting uniform, and he lied outrageously about his age, never being
 able to bring himself to own up to his forty-five years. Had he had more
 intelligence he might have made himself an object of greater dread, but as
 it was his over-weening vanity, kept him in a continual state of
 satisfaction with himself, for never could such a thing have entered his
 mind as that anyone could dare to ridicule him.
 </p>
 <p>
 At a subsequent period he rendered Delaherche services that were of
 inestimable value. But what days of terror and distress were those that
 followed upon the heels of the capitulation! the city, overrun with German
 soldiery, trembled in momentary dread of pillage and conflagration. Then
 the armies of the victors streamed away toward the valley of the Seine,
 leaving behind them only sufficient men to form a garrison, and the quiet
 that settled upon the place was that of a necropolis: the houses all
 closed, the shops shut, the streets deserted as soon as night closed in,
 the silence unbroken save for the hoarse cries and heavy tramp of the
 patrols. No letters or newspapers reached them from the outside world;
 Sedan was become a dungeon, where the immured citizens waited in agonized
 suspense for the tidings of disaster with which the air was instinct. To
 render their misery complete they were threatened with famine; the city
 awoke one morning from its slumbers to find itself destitute of bread and
 meat and the country roundabout stripped naked, as if a devouring swarm of
 locusts had passed that way, by the hundreds of thousands of men who for a
 week past had been pouring along its roads and across its fields in a
 devastating torrent. There were provisions only for two days, and the
 authorities were compelled to apply to Belgium for relief; all supplies
 now came from their neighbors across the frontier, whence the customs
 guards had disappeared, swept away like all else in the general cataclysm.
 Finally there were never-ending vexations and annoyances, a conflict that
 commenced to rage afresh each morning between the Prussian governor and
 his underlings, quartered at the Sous-Prefecture, and the Municipal
 Council, which was in permanent session at the Hotel de Ville. It was all
 in vain that the city fathers fought like heroes, discussing, objecting,
 protesting, contesting the ground inch by inch; the inhabitants had to
 succumb to the exactions that constantly became more burdensome, to the
 whims and unreasonableness of the stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
 In the beginning Delaherche suffered great tribulation from the officers
 and soldiers who were billeted on him. It seemed as if representatives
 from every nationality on the face of the globe presented themselves at
 his door, pipe in mouth. Not a day passed but there came tumbling in upon
 the city two or three thousand men, horse, foot and dragoons, and although
 they were by rights entitled to nothing more than shelter and firing, it
 was often found expedient to send out in haste and get them provisions.
 The rooms they occupied were left in a shockingly filthy condition. It was
 not an infrequent occurrence that the officers came in drunk and made
 themselves even more obnoxious than their men. Such strict discipline was
 maintained, however, that instances of violence and marauding were rare;
 in all Sedan there were but two cases reported of outrages committed on
 women. It was not until a later period, when Paris displayed such
 stubbornness in her resistance, that, exasperated by the length to which
 the struggle was protracted, alarmed by the attitude of the provinces and
 fearing a general rising of the populace, the savage war which the
 francs-tireurs had inaugurated, they laid the full weight of their heavy
 hand upon the suffering people.
 </p>
 <p>
 Delaherche had just had an experience with a lodger who had been quartered
 on him, a captain of cuirassiers, who made a practice of going to bed with
 his boots on and when he went away left his apartment in an unmentionably
 filthy condition, when in the last half of September Captain de Gartlauben
 came to his door one evening when it was raining in torrents. The first
 hour he was there did not promise well for the pleasantness of their
 future relations; he carried matters with a high hand, insisting that he
 should be given the best bedroom, trailing the scabbard of his sword
 noisily up the marble staircase; but encountering Gilberte in the corridor
 he drew in his horns, bowed politely, and passed stiffly on. He was
 courted with great obsequiousness, for everyone was well aware that a word
 from him to the colonel commanding the post of Sedan would suffice to
 mitigate a requisition or secure the release of a friend or relative. It
 was not very long since his uncle, the governor-general at Rheims, had
 promulgated a particularly detestable and cold-blooded order, proclaiming
 martial law and decreeing the penalty of death to whomsoever should give
 aid and comfort to the enemy, whether by acting for them as a spy, by
 leading astray German troops that had been entrusted to their guidance, by
 destroying bridges and artillery, or by damaging the railroads and
 telegraph lines. The enemy meant the French, of course, and the citizens
 scowled and involuntarily doubled their fists as they read the great white
 placard nailed against the door of post headquarters which attributed to
 them as a crime their best and most sacred aspirations. It was so hard,
 too, to have to receive their intelligence of German victories through the
 cheering of the garrison! Hardly a day passed over their heads that they
 were spared this bitter humiliation; the soldiers would light great fires
 and sit around them, feasting and drinking all night long, while the
 townspeople, who were not allowed to be in the streets after nine o'clock,
 listened to the tumult from the depths of their darkened houses, crazed
 with suspense, wondering what new catastrophe had befallen. It was on one
 of these occasions, somewhere about the middle of October, that M. de
 Gartlauben for the first time proved himself to be possessed of some
 delicacy of feeling. Sedan had been jubilant all that day with renewed
 hopes, for there was a rumor that the army of the Loire, then marching to
 the relief of Paris, had gained a great victory; but how many times before
 had the best of news been converted into tidings of disaster! and sure
 enough, early in the evening it became known for certain that the
 Bavarians had taken Orleans. Some soldiers had collected in a house across
 the way from the factory in the Rue Maqua, and were so boisterous in their
 rejoicings that the Captain, noticing Gilberte's annoyance, went and
 silenced them, remarking that he himself thought their uproar ill-timed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Toward the close of the month M. de Gartlauben was in position to render
 some further trifling services. The Prussian authorities, in the course of
 sundry administrative reforms inaugurated by them, had appointed a German
 Sous-Prefect, and although this step did not put an end to the exactions
 to which the city was subjected, the new official showed himself to be
 comparatively reasonable. One of the most frequent among the causes of
 difference that were constantly springing up between the officers of the
 post and the municipal council was that which arose from the custom of
 requisitioning carriages for the use of the staff, and there was a great
 hullaballoo raised one morning that Delaherche failed to send his caleche
 and pair to the Sous-Prefecture: the mayor was arrested and the
 manufacturer would have gone to keep him company up in the citadel had it
 not been for M. de Gartlauben, who promptly quelled the rising storm.
 Another day he secured a stay of proceedings for the city, which had been
 mulcted in the sum of thirty thousand francs to punish it for its alleged
 dilatoriness in rebuilding the bridge of Villette, a bridge that the
 Prussians themselves had destroyed: a disastrous piece of business that
 was near being the ruin of Sedan. It was after the surrender at Metz,
 however, that Delaherche contracted his main debt of gratitude to his
 guest. The terrible news burst on the citizens like a thunderclap, dashing
 to the ground all their remaining hopes, and early in the ensuing week the
 streets again began to be encumbered with the countless hosts of the
 German forces, streaming down from the conquered fortress: the army of
 Prince Frederick Charles moving on the Loire, that of General Manteuffel,
 whose destination was Amiens and Rouen, and other corps on the march to
 reinforce the besiegers before Paris. For several days the houses were
 full to overflowing with soldiers, the butchers' and bakers' shops were
 swept clean, to the last bone, to the last crumb; the streets were
 pervaded by a greasy, tallowy odor, as after the passage of the great
 migratory bands of olden times. The buildings in the Rue Maqua, protected
 by a friendly influence, escaped the devastating irruption, and were only
 called on to give shelter to a few of the leaders, men of education and
 refinement.
 </p>
 <p>
 Owing to these circumstances, Delaherche at last began to lay aside his
 frostiness of manner. As a general thing the bourgeois families shut
 themselves in their apartments and avoided all communication with the
 officers who were billeted on them; but to him, who was of a sociable
 nature and liked to extract from life what enjoyment it had to offer, this
 enforced sulkiness in the end became unbearable. His great, silent house,
 where the inmates lived apart from one another in a chill atmosphere of
 distrust and mutual dislike, damped his spirits terribly. He began by
 stopping M. de Gartlauben on the stairs one day to thank him for his
 favors, and thus by degrees it became a regular habit with the two men to
 exchange a few words when they met. The result was that one evening the
 Prussian captain found himself seated in his host's study before the
 fireplace where some great oak logs were blazing, smoking a cigar and
 amicably discussing the news of the day. For the first two weeks of their
 new intimacy Gilberte did not make her appearance in the room; he affected
 to ignore her existence, although, at every faintest sound, his glance
 would be directed expectantly upon the door of the connecting apartment.
 It seemed to be his object to keep his position as an enemy as much as
 possible in the background, trying to show he was not narrow-minded or a
 bigoted patriot, laughing and joking pleasantly over certain rather
 ridiculous requisitions. For example, a demand was made one day for a
 coffin and a shroud; that shroud and coffin afforded him no end of
 amusement. As regarded other things, such as coal, oil, milk, sugar,
 butter, bread, meat, to say nothing of clothing, stoves and lamps&mdash;all
 the necessaries of daily life, in a word&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders:
 <i>mon Dieu!</i> what would you have? No doubt it was vexatious; he was
 even willing to admit that their demands were excessive, but that was how
 it was in war times; they had to keep themselves alive in the enemy's
 country. Delaherche, who was very sore over these incessant requisitions,
 expressed his opinion of them with frankness, pulling them to pieces
 mercilessly at their nightly confabs, in much the same way as he might
 have criticised the cook's kitchen accounts. On only one occasion did
 their discussion become at all acrimonious, and that was in relation to
 the impost of a million francs that the Prussian prefet at Rethel had
 levied on the department of the Ardennes, the alleged pretense of which
 was to indemnify Germany for damages caused by French ships of war and by
 the expulsion of Germans domiciled in French territory. Sedan's
 proportionate share of the assessment was forty-two thousand francs. And
 he labored strenuously with his visitor to convince him of the iniquity of
 the imposition; the city was differently circumstanced from the other
 towns, it had had more than its share of affliction, and should not be
 burdened with that new exaction. The pair always came out of their
 discussions better friends than when they went in; one delighted to have
 had an opportunity of hearing himself talk, the other pleased with himself
 for having displayed a truly Parisian urbanity.
 </p>
 <p>
 One evening Gilberte came into the room, with her air of thoughtless
 gayety. She paused at the threshold, affecting embarrassment. M. de
 Gartlauben rose, and with much tact presently withdrew, but on repeating
 his visit the following evening and finding Gilberte there again, he
 settled himself in his usual seat in the chimney-corner. It was the
 commencement of a succession of delightful evenings that they passed
 together in the study of the master of the house, not in the drawing-room&mdash;wherein
 lay a nice distinction. And at a later period when, yielding to their
 guest's entreaties, the young woman consented to play for him, she did not
 invite him to the salon, but entered the room alone, leaving the
 communicating door open. In those bitter winter evenings the old oaks of
 the Ardennes gave out a grateful warmth from the depths of the great
 cavernous fireplace; there was a cup of fragrant tea for them about ten
 o'clock; they laughed and chatted in the comfortable, bright room. And it
 did not require extra powers of vision to see that M. de Gartlauben was
 rapidly falling head over ears in love with that sprightly young woman,
 who flirted with him as audaciously as she had flirted in former days at
 Charleville with Captain Beaudoin's friends. He began to pay increased
 attention to his person, displayed a gallantry that verged on the
 fantastic, was raised to the pinnacle of bliss by the most trifling favor,
 tormented by the one ever-present anxiety not to appear a barbarian in her
 eyes, a rude soldier who did not know the ways of women.
 </p>
 <p>
 And thus it was that in the big, gloomy house in the Rue Maqua a twofold
 life went on. While at meal-times Edmond, the wounded cherub with the
 pretty face, lent a listening ear to Delaherche's unceasing chatter,
 blushing if ever Gilberte asked him to pass her the salt, while at evening
 M. de Gartlauben, seated in the study, with eyes upturned in silent
 ecstasy, listened to a sonata by Mozart performed for his benefit by the
 young woman in the adjoining drawing-room, a stillness as of death
 continued to pervade the apartment where Colonel de Vineuil and Madame
 Delaherche spent their days, the blinds tight drawn, the lamp continually
 burning, like a votive candle illuminating a tomb. December had come and
 wrapped the city in a winding-sheet of snow; the cruel news seemed all the
 bitterer for the piercing cold. After General Ducrot's repulse at
 Champigny, after the loss of Orleans, there was left but one dark, sullen
 hope: that the soil of France might avenge their defeat, exterminate and
 swallow up the victors. Let the snow fall thicker and thicker still, let
 the earth's crust crack and open under the biting frost, that in it the
 entire German nation might find a grave! And there came another sorrow to
 wring poor Madame Delaherche's heart. One night when her son was from
 home, having been suddenly called away to Belgium on business, chancing to
 pass Gilberte's door she heard within a low murmur of voices and smothered
 laughter. Disgusted and sick at heart she returned to her own room, where
 her horror of the abominable thing she suspected the existence of would
 not let her sleep: it could have been none other but the Prussian whose
 voice she heard; she had thought she had noticed glances of intelligence
 passing; she was prostrated by this supreme disgrace. Ah, that woman, that
 abandoned woman, whom her son had insisted on bringing to the house
 despite her commands and prayers, whom she had forgiven, by her silence,
 after Captain Beaudoin's death! And now the thing was repeated, and this
 time the infamy was even worse. What was she to do? Such an enormity must
 not go unpunished beneath her roof. Her mind was torn by the conflict that
 raged there, in her uncertainty as to the course she should pursue. The
 colonel, desiring to know nothing of what occurred outside his room,
 always checked her with a gesture when he thought she was about to give
 him any piece of news, and she had said nothing to him of the matter that
 had caused her such suffering; but on those days when she came to him with
 tears standing in her eyes and sat for hours in mournful silence, he would
 look at her and say to himself that France had sustained yet another
 defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
 This was the condition of affairs in the house in the Rue Maqua when
 Henriette dropped in there one morning to endeavor to secure Delaherche's
 influence in favor of Father Fouchard. She had heard people speak, smiling
 significantly as they did so, of the servitude to which Gilberte had
 reduced Captain de Gartlauben; she was, therefore, somewhat embarrassed
 when she encountered old Madame Delaherche, to whom she thought it her
 duty to explain the object of her visit, ascending the great staircase on
 her way to the colonel's apartment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Dear madame, it would be so kind of you to assist us! My uncle is in
 great danger; they talk of sending him away to Germany."
 </p>
 <p>
 The old lady, although she had a sincere affection for Henriette, could
 scarce conceal her anger as she replied:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I am powerless to help you, my child; you should not apply to me." And
 she continued, notwithstanding the agitation on the other's face: "You
 have selected an unfortunate moment for your visit; my son has to go to
 Belgium to-night. Besides, he could not have helped you; he has no more
 influence than I have. Go to my daughter-in-law; she is all powerful."
 </p>
 <p>
 And she passed on toward the colonel's room, leaving Henriette distressed
 to have unwittingly involved herself in a family drama. Within the last
 twenty-four hours Madame Delaherche had made up her mind to lay the whole
 matter before her son before his departure for Belgium, whither he was
 going to negotiate a large purchase of coal to enable him to put some of
 his idle looms in motion. She could not endure the thought that the
 abominable thing should be repeated beneath her eyes while he was absent,
 and was only waiting to make sure he would not defer his departure until
 some other day, as he had been doing all the past week. It was a terrible
 thing to contemplate: the wreck of her son's happiness, the Prussian
 disgraced and driven from their doors, the wife, too, thrust forth upon
 the street and her name ignominiously placarded on the walls, as had been
 threatened would be done with any woman who should dishonor herself with a
 German.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte gave a little scream of delight on beholding Henriette.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, how glad I am to see you! It seems an age since we met, and one grows
 old so fast in the midst of all these horrors!" Thus running on she
 dragged her friend to her bedroom, where she seated her on the lounge and
 snuggled down close beside her. "Come, take off your things; you must stay
 and breakfast with us. But first we'll talk a bit; you must have such lots
 and lots of things to tell me! I know that you are without news of your
 brother. Ah, that poor Maurice, how I pity him, shut up in Paris, with no
 gas, no wood, no bread, perhaps! And that young man whom you have been
 nursing, that friend of your brother's&mdash;oh! a little bird has told me
 all about it&mdash;isn't it for his sake you are here to-day?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette's conscience smote her, and she did not answer. Was it not
 really for Jean's sake that she had come, in order that, the old uncle
 being released, the invalid, who had grown so dear to her, might have no
 further cause for alarm? It distressed her to hear his name mentioned by
 Gilberte; she could not endure the thought of enlisting in his favor an
 influence that was of so ambiguous a character. Her inbred scruples of a
 pure, honest woman made themselves felt, now it seemed to her that the
 rumors of a liaison with the Prussian captain had some foundation.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Then I'm to understand that it's in behalf of this young man that you
 come to us for assistance?" Gilberte insistently went on, as if enjoying
 her friend's discomfiture. And as the latter, cornered and unable to
 maintain silence longer, finally spoke of Father Fouchard's arrest: "Why,
 to be sure! What a silly thing I am&mdash;and I was talking of it only
 this morning! You did well in coming to us, my dear; we must go about your
 uncle's affair at once and see what we can do for him, for the last news I
 had was not reassuring. They are on the lookout for someone of whom to
 make an example."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, I have had you in mind all along," Henriette hesitatingly replied.
 "I thought you might be willing to assist me with your advice, perhaps
 with something more substantial&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 The young woman laughed merrily. "You little goose, I'll have your uncle
 released inside three days. Don't you know that I have a Prussian captain
 here in the house who stands ready to obey my every order? Understand, he
 can refuse me nothing!" And she laughed more heartily than ever, in the
 giddy, thoughtless triumph of her coquettish nature, holding in her own
 and patting the hands of her friend, who was so uncomfortable that she
 could not find words in which to express her thanks, horrified by the
 avowal that was implied in what she had just heard. But how to account for
 such serenity, such childlike gayety? "Leave it to me; I'll send you home
 to-night with a mind at rest."
 </p>
 <p>
 When they passed into the dining room Henriette was struck by Edmond's
 delicate beauty, never having seen him before. She eyed him with the
 pleasure she would have felt in looking at a pretty toy. Could it be
 possible that that boy had served in the army? and how could they have
 been so cruel as to break his arm? The story of his gallantry in the field
 made him even more interesting still, and Delaherche, who had received
 Henriette with the cordiality of a man to whom the sight of a new face is
 a godsend, while the servants were handing round the cutlets and the
 potatoes cooked in their jackets, never seemed to tire of eulogizing his
 secretary, who was as industrious and well behaved as he was handsome.
 They made a very pleasant and homelike picture, the four, thus seated
 around the bright table in the snug, warm dining room.
 </p>
 <p>
 "So you want us to interest ourselves in Father Fouchard's case, and it's
 to that we owe the pleasure of your visit, eh?" said the manufacturer.
 "I'm extremely sorry that I have to go away to-night, but my wife will set
 things straight for you in a jiffy; there's no resisting her, she has only
 to ask for a thing to get it." He laughed as he concluded his speech,
 which was uttered in perfect simplicity of soul, evidently pleased and
 flattered that his wife possessed such influence, in which he shone with a
 kind of reflected glory. Then turning suddenly to her: "By the way, my
 dear, has Edmond told you of his great discovery?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "No; what discovery?" asked Gilberte, turning her pretty caressing eyes
 full on the young sergeant.
 </p>
 <p>
 The cherub blushed whenever a woman looked at him in that way, as if the
 exquisiteness of his sensations was too much for him. "It's nothing,
 madame; only a bit of old lace; I heard you saying the other day you
 wanted some to put on your mauve peignoir. I happened yesterday to come
 across five yards of old Bruges point, something really handsome and very
 cheap. The woman will be here presently to show it to you."
 </p>
 <p>
 She could have kissed him, so delighted was she. "Oh, how nice of you! You
 shall have your reward."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, while a terrine of foie-gras, purchased in Belgium, was being
 served, the conversation took another turn; dwelling for an instant on the
 quantities of fish that were dying of poison in the Meuse, and finally
 coming around to the subject of the pestilence that menaced Sedan when
 there should be a thaw. Even as early as November, there had been several
 cases of disease of an epidemic character. Six thousand francs had been
 expended after the battle in cleansing the city and collecting and burning
 clothing, knapsacks, haversacks, all the debris that was capable of
 harboring infection; but, for all that, the surrounding fields continued
 to exhale sickening odors whenever there came a day or two of warmer
 weather, so replete were they with half-buried corpses, covered only with
 a few inches of loose earth. In every direction the ground was dotted with
 graves; the soil cracked and split in obedience to the forces acting
 beneath its surface, and from the fissures thus formed the gases of
 putrefaction issued to poison the living. In those more recent days,
 moreover, another center of contamination had been discovered, the Meuse,
 although there had already been removed from it the bodies of more than
 twelve hundred dead horses. It was generally believed that there were no
 more human remains left in the stream, until, one day, a <i>garde
 champetre</i>, looking attentively down into the water where it was some
 six feet deep, discovered some objects glimmering at the bottom, that at
 first he took for stones; but they proved to be corpses of men, that had
 been mutilated in such a manner as to prevent the gas from accumulating in
 the cavities of the body and hence had been kept from rising to the
 surface. For near four months they had been lying there in the water among
 the eel-grass. When grappled for the irons brought them up in fragments, a
 head, an arm, or a leg at a time; at times the force of the current would
 suffice to detach a hand or foot and send it rolling down the stream.
 Great bubbles of gas rose to the surface and burst, still further
 empoisoning the air.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We shall get along well enough as long as the cold weather lasts,"
 remarked Delaherche, "but as soon as the snow is off the ground we shall
 have to go to work in earnest to abate the nuisance; if we don't we shall
 be wanting graves for ourselves." And when his wife laughingly asked him
 if he could not find some more agreeable subject to talk about at the
 table, he concluded by saying: "Well, it will be a long time before any of
 us will care to eat any fish out of the Meuse."
 </p>
 <p>
 They had finished their repast, and the coffee was being poured, when the
 maid came to the door and announced that M. de Gartlauben presented his
 compliments and wanted to know if he might be allowed to see them for a
 moment. There was a slight flutter of excitement, for it was the first
 time he had ever presented himself at that hour of the day. Delaherche,
 seeing in the circumstance a favorable opportunity for presenting
 Henriette to him, gave orders that he should be introduced at once. The
 doughty captain, when he beheld another young woman in the room, surpassed
 himself in politeness, even accepting a cup of coffee, which he took
 without sugar, as he had seen many people do at Paris. He had only asked
 to be received at that unusual hour, he said, that he might tell Madame he
 had succeeded in obtaining the pardon of one of her proteges, a poor
 operative in the factory who had been arrested on account of a squabble
 with a Prussian. And Gilberte thereon seized the opportunity to mention
 Father Fouchard's case.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Captain, I wish to make you acquainted with one of my dearest friends,
 who desires to place herself under your protection. She is the niece of
 the farmer who was arrested lately at Remilly, as you are aware, for being
 mixed up with that business of the francs-tireurs."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, I know; the affair of the spy, the poor fellow who was found in
 a sack with his throat cut. It's a bad business, a very bad business. I am
 afraid I shall not be able to do anything."
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, Captain, don't say that! I should consider it such a favor!"
 </p>
 <p>
 There was a caress in the look she cast on him, while he beamed with
 satisfaction, bowing his head in gallant obedience. Her wish was his law!
 </p>
 <p>
 "You would have all my gratitude, sir," faintly murmured Henriette, to
 whose memory suddenly rose the image of her husband, her dear Weiss,
 slaughtered down yonder at Bazeilles, filling her with invincible
 repugnance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Edmond, who had discreetly taken himself off on the arrival of the
 captain, now reappeared and whispered something in Gilberte's ear. She
 rose quickly from the table, and, announcing to the company that she was
 going to inspect her lace, excused herself and followed the young man from
 the room. Henriette, thus left alone with the two men, went and took a
 seat by herself in the embrasure of a window, while they remained seated
 at the table and went on talking in a loud tone.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Captain, you'll have a <i>petit verre</i> with me. You see I don't stand
 on ceremony with you; I say whatever comes into my head, because I know
 you to be a fair-minded man. Now I tell you your prefet is all wrong in
 trying to extort those forty-two thousand francs from the city. Just think
 once of all our losses since the beginning of the war. In the first place,
 before the battle, we had the entire French army on our hands, a set of
 ragged, hungry, exhausted men; and then along came your rascals, and their
 appetites were not so very poor, either. The passage of those troops
 through the place, what with requisitions, repairing damages and expenses
 of all sorts, stood us in a million and a half. Add as much more for the
 destruction caused by your artillery and by conflagration during the
 battle; there you have three millions. Finally, I am well within bounds in
 estimating the loss sustained by our trade and manufactures at two
 millions. What do you say to that, eh? A grand total of five million
 francs for a city of thirteen thousand inhabitants! And now you come and
 ask us for forty-two thousand more as a contribution to the expense of
 carrying on the war against us! Is it fair, is it reasonable? I leave it
 to your own sense of justice."
 </p>
 <p>
 M. de Gartlauben nodded his head with an air of profundity, and made
 answer:
 </p>
 <p>
 "What can you expect? It is the fortune of war, the fortune of war."
 </p>
 <p>
 To Henriette, seated in her window seat, her ears ringing, and vague, sad
 images of every sort fleeting through her brain, the time seemed to pass
 with mortal slowness, while Delaherche asserted on his word of honor that
 Sedan could never have weathered the crisis produced by the exportation of
 all their specie had it not been for the wisdom of the local magnates in
 emitting an issue of paper money, a step that had saved the city from
 financial ruin.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Captain, will you have just a drop of cognac more?" and he skipped to
 another topic. "It was not France that started the war; it was the
 Emperor. Ah, I was greatly deceived in the Emperor. He need never expect
 to sit on the throne again; we would see the country dismembered first.
 Look here! there was just one man in this country last July who saw things
 as they were, and that was M. Thiers; and his action at the present time
 in visiting the different capitals of Europe is most wise and patriotic.
 He has the best wishes of every good citizen; may he be successful!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He expressed the conclusion of his idea by a gesture, for he would have
 considered it improper to speak of his desire for peace before a Prussian,
 no matter how friendly he might be, although the desire burned fiercely in
 his bosom, as it did in that of every member of the old conservative
 bourgeoisie who had favored the plebiscite. Their men and money were
 exhausted, it was time for them to throw up the sponge; and a deep-seated
 feeling of hatred toward Paris, for the obstinacy with which it held out,
 prevailed in all the provinces that were in possession of the enemy. He
 concluded in a lower tone, his allusion being to Gambetta's inflammatory
 proclamations:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no, we cannot give our suffrages to fools and madmen. The course they
 advocate would end in general massacre. I, for my part, am for M. Thiers,
 who would submit the questions at issue to the popular vote, and as for
 their Republic, great heavens! let them have it if they want it, while
 waiting for something better; it don't trouble me in the slightest."
 </p>
 <p>
 Captain de Gartlauben continued to nod his head very politely with an
 approving air, murmuring:
 </p>
 <p>
 "To be sure, to be sure&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette, whose feeling of distress had been increasing, could stand
 their talk no longer. She could assign no definite reason for the
 sensation of inquietude that possessed her; it was only a longing to get
 away, and she rose and left the room quietly in quest of Gilberte, whose
 absence had been so long protracted. On entering the bedroom, however, she
 was greatly surprised to find her friend stretched on the lounge, weeping
 bitterly and manifestly suffering from some extremely painful emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why, what is the matter? What has happened you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 The young woman's tears flowed faster still and she would not speak,
 manifesting a confusion that sent every drop of blood coursing from her
 heart up to her face. At last, throwing herself into the arms that were
 opened to receive her and concealing her face in the other's bosom, she
 stammered:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, darling if you but knew. I shall never dare to tell you&mdash;and yet
 I have no one but you, you alone perhaps can tell me what is best to do."
 A shiver passed through her frame, her voice was scarcely audible. "I was
 with Edmond&mdash;and then&mdash;and then Madame Delaherche came into the
 room and caught me&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Caught you! What do you mean?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, we were here in the room; he was holding me in his arms and kissing
 me&mdash;" And clasping Henriette convulsively in her trembling arms she
 told her all. "Oh, my darling, don't judge me severely; I could not bear
 it! I know I promised you it should never happen again, but you have seen
 Edmond, you know how brave he is, how handsome! And think once of the poor
 young man, wounded, ill, with no one to give him a mother's care! And then
 he has never had the enjoyments that wealth affords; his family have
 pinched themselves to give him an education. I could not be harsh with
 him."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette listened, the picture of surprise; she could not recover from
 her amazement. "What! you don't mean to say it was the little sergeant!
 Why, my dear, everyone believes the Prussian to be your lover!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Gilberte straightened herself up with an indignant air, and dried her
 eyes. "The Prussian my lover? No, thank you! He's detestable; I can't
 endure him. I wonder what they take me for? What have I ever done that
 they should suppose I could be guilty of such baseness? No, never! I would
 rather die than do such a thing!" In the earnestness of her protestations
 her beauty had assumed an angry and more lofty cast that made her look
 other than she was. And all at once, sudden as a flash, her coquettish
 gayety, her thoughtless levity, came back to her face, accompanied by a
 peal of silvery laughter. "I won't deny that I amuse myself at his
 expense. He adores me, and I have only to give him a look to make him
 obey. You have no idea what fun it is to bamboozle that great big man, who
 seems to think he will have his reward some day."
 </p>
 <p>
 "But that is a very dangerous game you're playing," Henriette gravely
 said.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, do you think so? What risk do I incur? When he comes to see he has
 nothing to expect he can't do more than be angry with me and go away. But
 he will never see it! You don't know the man; I read him like a book from
 the very start: he is one of those men with whom a woman can do what she
 pleases and incur no danger. I have an instinct that guides me in these
 matters and which has never deceived me. He is too consumed by vanity; no
 human consideration will ever drive it into his head that by any
 possibility a woman could get the better of him. And all he will get from
 me will be permission to carry away my remembrance, with the consoling
 thought that he has done the proper thing and behaved himself like a
 gallant man who has long been an inhabitant of Paris." And with her air of
 triumphant gayety she added: "But before he leaves he shall cause Uncle
 Fouchard to be set at liberty, and all his recompense for his trouble
 shall be a cup of tea sweetened by these fingers."
 </p>
 <p>
 But suddenly her fears returned to her: she remembered what must be the
 terrible consequences of her indiscretion, and her eyes were again bedewed
 with tears.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> and Madame Delaherche&mdash;how will it all end? She
 bears me no love; she is capable of telling the whole story to my
 husband."
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette had recovered her composure. She dried her friend's eyes, and
 made her rise from the lounge and arrange her disordered clothing.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Listen, my dear; I cannot bring myself to scold you, and yet you know
 what my sentiments must be. But I was so alarmed by the stories I heard
 about the Prussian, the business wore such an extremely ugly aspect, that
 this affair really comes to me as a sort of relief by comparison. Cease
 weeping; things may come out all right."
 </p>
 <p>
 Her action was taken none too soon, for almost immediately Delaherche and
 his mother entered the room. He said that he had made up his mind to take
 the train for Brussels that afternoon and had been giving orders to have a
 carriage ready to carry him across the frontier into Belgium; so he had
 come to say good-by to his wife. Then turning and addressing Henriette:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You need have no further fears. M. de Gartlauben, just is he was going
 away, promised me he would attend to your uncle's case, and although I
 shall not be here, my wife will keep an eye to it."
 </p>
 <p>
 Since Madame Delaherche had made her appearance in the apartment Gilberte
 had not once taken her anxious eyes from off her face. Would she speak,
 would she tell what she had seen, and keep her son from starting on his
 projected journey? The elder lady, also, soon as she crossed the
 threshold, had bent her fixed gaze in silence on her daughter-in-law.
 Doubtless her stern patriotism induced her to view the matter in somewhat
 the same light that Henriette had viewed it. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> since it was
 that young man, that Frenchman who had fought so bravely, was it not her
 duty to forgive, even as she had forgiven once before, in Captain
 Beaudoin's case? A look of greater softness rose to her eyes; she averted
 her head. Her son might go; Edmond would be there to protect Gilberte
 against the Prussian. She even smiled faintly, she whose grim face had
 never once relaxed since the news of the victory at Coulmiers.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>," she said, folding her son in her arms. "Finish up your
 business quickly as you can and come back to us."
 </p>
 <p>
 And she took herself slowly away, returning to the prison-like chamber
 across the corridor, where the colonel, with his dull gaze, was peering
 into the shadows that lay outside the disk of bright light which fell from
 the lamp.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette returned to Remilly that same evening, and one morning, three
 days afterward, had the pleasure to see Father Fouchard come walking into
 the house, as calmly as if he had merely stepped out to transact some
 business in the neighborhood. He took a seat by the table and refreshed
 himself with some bread and cheese, and to all the questions that were put
 to him replied with cool deliberation, like a man who had never seen
 anything to alarm him in his situation. What reason had he to be afraid?
 He had done nothing wrong; it was not he who had killed the Prussian, was
 it? So he had just said to the authorities: "Investigate the matter; I
 know nothing about it." And they could do nothing but release him, and the
 mayor as well, seeing they had no proofs against them. But the eyes of the
 crafty, sly old peasant gleamed with delight at the thought of how nicely
 he had pulled the wool over the eyes of those dirty blackguards, who were
 beginning to higgle with him over the quality of the meat he furnished to
 them.
 </p>
 <p>
 December was drawing near its end, and Jean insisted on going away. His
 leg was quite strong again, and the doctor announced that he was fit to go
 and join the army. This was to Henriette a subject of profoundest sorrow,
 which she kept locked in her bosom as well as she was able. No tidings
 from Paris had reached them since the disastrous battle of Champigny; all
 they knew was that Maurice's regiment had been exposed to a murderous fire
 and had suffered severely. Ever that deep, unbroken silence; no letter,
 never the briefest line for them, when they knew that families in Raucourt
 and Sedan were receiving intelligence of their loved ones by circuitous
 ways. Perhaps the pigeon that was bringing them the so eagerly wished-for
 news had fallen a victim to some hungry bird of prey, perhaps the bullet
 of a Prussian had brought it to the ground at the margin of a wood. But
 the fear that haunted them most of all was that Maurice was dead; the
 silence of the great city off yonder in the distance, uttering no cry in
 the mortal hug of the investment, was become to them in their agonized
 suspense the silence of death. They had abandoned all hope of tidings, and
 when Jean declared his settled purpose to be gone, Henriette only gave
 utterance to this stifled cry of despair:
 </p>
 <p>
 "My God! then all is ended, and I am to be left alone!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Jean's desire to go and serve with the Army of the North, which had
 recently been re-formed under General Faidherbe. Now that General
 Manteuffel's corps had moved forward to Dieppe there were three
 departments, cut off from the rest of France, that this army had to
 defend, le Nord, le Pas-de-Calais, and la Somme, and Jean's plan, not a
 difficult one to carry into execution, was simply to make for Bouillon and
 thence complete his journey across Belgian territory. He knew that the 23d
 corps was being recruited, mainly from such old soldiers of Sedan and Metz
 as could be gathered to the standards. He had heard it reported that
 General Faidherbe was about to take the field, and had definitely
 appointed the next ensuing Sunday as the day of his departure, when news
 reached him of the battle of Pont-Noyelle, that drawn battle which came so
 near being a victory for the French.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Dr. Dalichamp again in this instance who offered the services of
 his gig and himself as driver to Bouillon. The good man's courage and
 kindness were boundless. At Raucourt, where typhus was raging,
 communicated by the Bavarians, there was not a house where he had not one
 or more patients, and this labor was additional to his regular attendance
 at the two hospitals at Raucourt and Remilly. His ardent patriotism, the
 impulse that prompted him to protest against unnecessary barbarity, had
 twice led to his being arrested by the Prussians, only to be released on
 each occasion. He gave a little laugh of satisfaction, therefore, the
 morning he came with his vehicle to take up Jean, pleased to be the
 instrument of assisting the escape of another of the victims of Sedan,
 those poor, brave fellows, as he called them, to whom he gave his
 professional services and whom he aided with his purse. Jean, who knew of
 Henriette's straitened circumstances and had been suffering from lack of
 funds since his relapse, accepted gratefully the fifty francs that the
 doctor offered him for traveling expenses.
 </p>
 <p>
 Father Fouchard did things handsomely at the leave-taking, sending Silvine
 to the cellar for two bottles of wine and insisting that everyone should
 drink a glass to the extermination of the Germans. He was a man of
 importance in the country nowadays and had his "plum" hidden away
 somewhere or other; he could sleep in peace now that the francs-tireurs
 had disappeared, driven like wild beasts from their lair, and his sole
 wish was for a speedy conclusion of the war. He had even gone so far in
 one of his generous fits as to pay Prosper his wages in order to retain
 his services on the farm, which the young man had no thought of leaving.
 He touched glasses with Prosper, and also with Silvine, whom he at times
 was half inclined to marry, knowing what a treasure he had in his
 faithful, hard-working little servant; but what was the use? he knew she
 would never leave him, that she would still be there when Charlot should
 be grown and go in turn to serve his country as a soldier. And touching
 his glass to Henriette's, Jean's, and the doctor's, he exclaimed:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Here's to the health of you all! May you all prosper and be no worse off
 than I am!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette would not let Jean go away without accompanying him as far as
 Sedan. He was in citizen's dress, wearing a frock coat and derby hat that
 the doctor had loaned him. The day was piercingly cold; the sun's rays
 were reflected from a crust of glittering snow. Their intention had been
 to pass through the city without stopping, but when Jean learned that his
 old colonel was still at the Delaherches' he felt an irresistible desire
 to go and pay his respects to him, and at the same time thank the
 manufacturer for his many kindnesses. His visit was destined to bring him
 an additional, a final sorrow, in that city of mournful memories. On
 reaching the structure in the Rue Maqua they found the household in a
 condition of the greatest distress and disorder, Gilberte wringing her
 hands, Madame Delaherche weeping great silent tears, while her son, who
 had come in from the factory, where work was gradually being resumed,
 uttered exclamations of surprise. The colonel had just been discovered,
 stone dead, lying exactly as he had fallen, in a heap on the floor of his
 chamber. The physician, who was summoned with all haste, could assign no
 cause for the sudden death; there was no indication of paralysis or heart
 trouble. The colonel had been stricken down, and no one could tell from
 what quarter the blow came; but the following morning, when the room was
 thrown open, a piece of an old newspaper was found, lying on the carpet,
 that had been wrapped around a book and contained the account of the
 surrender of Metz.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My, dear," said Gilberte to Henriette, "as Captain de Gartlauben was
 coming downstairs just now he removed his hat as he passed the door of the
 room where my uncle's body is lying. Edmond saw it; he's an extremely
 well-bred man, don't you think so?"
 </p>
 <p>
 In all their intimacy Jean had never yet kissed Henriette. Before resuming
 his seat in the gig with the doctor he endeavored to thank her for all her
 devoted kindness, for having nursed and loved him as a brother, but
 somehow the words would not come at his command; he opened his arms and,
 with a great sob, clasped her in a long embrace, and she, beside herself
 with the grief of parting, returned his kiss. Then the horse started, he
 turned about in his seat, there was a waving of hands, while again and
 again two sorrowful voices repeated in choking accents:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell! Farewell!"
 </p>
 <p>
 On her return to Remilly that evening Henriette reported for duty at the
 hospital. During the silent watches of the night she was visited by
 another convulsive attack of sobbing, and wept, wept as if her tears would
 never cease to flow, clasping her hands before her as if between them to
 strangle her bitter sorrow.

 VII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 On the day succeeding the battle of Sedan the mighty hosts of the two
 German armies, without the delay of a moment, commenced their march on
 Paris, the army of the Meuse coming in by the north through the valley of
 the Marne, while the third army, passing the Seine at
 Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, turned the city to the south and moved on
 Versailles; and when, on that bright, warm September morning, General
 Ducrot, to whom had been assigned the command of the as yet incomplete
 14th corps, determined to attack the latter force while it was marching by
 the flank, Maurice's new regiment, the 115th, encamped in the woods to the
 left of Meudon, did not receive its orders to advance until the day was
 lost. A few shells from the enemy sufficed to do the work; the panic
 started with a regiment of zouaves made up of raw recruits, and quickly
 spreading to the other troops, all were swept away in a headlong rout that
 never ceased until they were safe behind the walls of Paris, where the
 utmost consternation prevailed. Every position in advance of the southern
 line of fortifications was lost, and that evening the wires of the Western
 Railway telegraph, the city's sole remaining means of communicating with
 the rest of France, were cut. Paris was cut off from the world.
 </p>
 <p>
 The condition of their affairs caused Maurice a terrible dejection. Had
 the Germans been more enterprising they might have pitched their tents
 that night in the Place du Carrousel, but with the prudence of their race
 they had determined that the siege should be conducted according to rule
 and precept, and had already fixed upon the exact lines of investment, the
 position of the army of the Meuse being at the north, stretching from
 Croissy to the Marne, through Epinay, the cordon of the third army at the
 south, from Chennevieres to Chatillon and Bougival, while general
 headquarters, with King William, Bismarck, and General von Moltke, were
 established at Versailles. The gigantic blockade, that no one believed
 could be successfully completed, was an accomplished fact; the city, with
 its girdle of fortifications eight leagues and a half in length, embracing
 fifteen forts and six detached redoubts, was henceforth to be transformed
 into a huge prison-pen. And the army of the defenders comprised only the
 13th corps, commanded by General Vinoy, and the 14th, then in process of
 reconstruction under General Ducrot, the two aggregating an effective
 strength of eighty thousand men; to which were to be added fourteen
 thousand sailors, fifteen thousand of the francs corps, and a hundred and
 fifteen thousand mobiles, not to mention the three hundred thousand
 National Guards distributed among the sectional divisions of the ramparts.
 If this seems like a large force it must be remembered that there were few
 seasoned and trained soldiers among its numbers. Men were constantly being
 drilled and equipped; Paris was a great intrenched camp. The preparations
 for the defense went on from hour to hour with feverish haste; roads were
 built, houses demolished within the military zone; the two hundred siege
 guns and the twenty-five hundred pieces of lesser caliber were mounted in
 position, other guns were cast; an arsenal, complete in every detail,
 seemed to spring from the earth under the tireless efforts of Dorian, the
 patriotic war minister. When, after the rupture of the negotiations at
 Ferrieres, Jules Favre acquainted the country with M. von Bismarck's
 demands&mdash;the cession of Alsace, the garrison of Strasbourg to be
 surrendered, three milliards of indemnity&mdash;a cry of rage went up and
 the continuation of the war was demanded by acclaim as a condition
 indispensable to the country's existence. Even with no hope of victory
 Paris must defend herself in order that France might live.
 </p>
 <p>
 On a Sunday toward the end of September Maurice was detailed to carry a
 message to the further end of the city, and what he witnessed along the
 streets he passed through filled him with new hope. Ever since the defeat
 of Chatillon it had seemed to him that the courage of the people was
 rising to a level with the great task that lay before them. Ah! that Paris
 that he had known so thoughtless, so wayward, so keen in the pursuit of
 pleasure; he found it now quite changed, simple, earnest, cheerfully
 brave, ready for every sacrifice. Everyone was in uniform; there was
 scarce a head that was not decorated with the <i>kepi</i> of the National
 Guard. Business of every sort had come to a sudden standstill, as the
 hands of a watch cease to move when the mainspring snaps, and at the
 public meetings, among the soldiers in the guard-room, or where the crowds
 collected in the streets, there was but one subject of conversation,
 inflaming the hearts and minds of all&mdash;the determination to conquer.
 The contagious influence of illusion, scattered broadcast, unbalanced
 weaker minds; the people were tempted to acts of generous folly by the
 tension to which they were subjected. Already there was a taint of morbid,
 nervous excitability in the air, a feverish condition in which men's hopes
 and fears alike became distorted and exaggerated, arousing the worst
 passions of humanity at the slightest breath of suspicion. And Maurice was
 witness to a scene in the Rue des Martyrs that produced a profound
 impression on him, the assault made by a band of infuriated men on a house
 from which, at one of the upper windows, a bright light had been displayed
 all through the night, a signal, evidently, intended to reach the
 Prussians at Bellevue over the roofs of Paris. There were jealous citizens
 who spent all their nights on their house-tops, watching what was going on
 around them. The day before a poor wretch had had a narrow escape from
 drowning at the hands of the mob, merely because he had opened a map of
 the city on a bench in the Tuileries gardens and consulted it.
 </p>
 <p>
 And that epidemic of suspicion Maurice, who had always hitherto been so
 liberal and fair-minded, now began to feel the influence of in the altered
 views he was commencing to entertain concerning men and things. He had
 ceased to give way to despair, as he had done after the rout at Chatillon,
 when he doubted whether the French army would ever muster up sufficient
 manhood to fight again: the sortie of the 30th of September on l'Hay and
 Chevilly, that of the 13th of October, in which the mobiles gained
 possession of Bagneux, and finally that of October 21, when his regiment
 captured and held for some time the park of la Malmaison, had restored to
 him all his confidence, that flame of hope that a spark sufficed to light
 and was extinguished as quickly. It was true the Prussians had repulsed
 them in every direction, but for all that the troops had fought bravely;
 they might yet be victorious in the end. It was Paris now that was
 responsible for the young man's gloomy forebodings, that great fickle city
 that at one moment was cheered by bright illusions and the next was sunk
 in deepest despair, ever haunted by the fear of treason in its thirst for
 victory. Did it not seem as if Trochu and Ducrot were treading in the
 footsteps of the Emperor and Marshal MacMahon and about to prove
 themselves incompetent leaders, the unconscious instruments of their
 country's ruin? The same movement that had swept away the Empire was now
 threatening the Government of National Defense, a fierce longing of the
 extremists to place themselves in control in order that they might save
 France by the methods of '92; even now Jules Favre and his co-members were
 more unpopular than the old ministers of Napoleon III. had ever been.
 Since they would not fight the Prussians, they would do well to make way
 for others, for those revolutionists who saw an assurance of victory in
 decreeing the <i>levee en masse</i>, in lending an ear to those
 visionaries who proposed to mine the earth beneath the Prussians' feet, or
 annihilate them all by means of a new fashioned Greek fire.
 </p>
 <p>
 Just previous to the 31st of October Maurice was more than usually a
 victim to this malady of distrust and barren speculation. He listened now
 approvingly to crude fancies that would formerly have brought a smile of
 contempt to his lips. Why should he not? Were not imbecility and crime
 abroad in the land? Was it unreasonable to look for the miraculous when
 his world was falling in ruins about him? Ever since the time he first
 heard the tidings of Froeschwiller, down there in front of Mulhausen, he
 had harbored a deep-seated feeling of rancor in his breast; he suffered
 from Sedan as from a raw sore, that bled afresh with every new reverse;
 the memory of their defeats, with all the anguish they entailed, was ever
 present to his mind; body and mind enfeebled by long marches, sleepless
 nights, and lack of food, inducing a mental torpor that left them doubtful
 even if they were alive; and the thought that so much suffering was to end
 in another and an irremediable disaster maddened him, made of that
 cultured man an unreflecting being, scarce higher in the scale than a very
 little child, swayed by each passing impulse of the moment. Anything,
 everything, destruction, extermination, rather than pay a penny of French
 money or yield an inch of French soil! The revolution that since the first
 reverse had been at work within him, sweeping away the legend of
 Napoleonic glory, the sentimental Bonapartism that he owed to the epic
 narratives of his grandfather, was now complete. He had ceased to be a
 believer in Republicanism, pure and simple, considering the remedy not
 drastic enough; he had begun to dabble in the theories of the extremists,
 he was a believer in the necessity of the Terror as the only means of
 ridding them of the traitors and imbeciles who were about to slay the
 country. And so it was that he was heart and soul with the insurgents
 when, on the 31st of October, tidings of disaster came pouring in on them
 in quick succession: the loss of Bourget, that had been captured from the
 enemy only a few days before by a dashing surprise; M. Thiers' return to
 Versailles from his visit to the European capitals, prepared to treat for
 peace, so it was said, in the name of Napoleon III.; and finally the
 capitulation of Metz, rumors of which had previously been current and
 which was now confirmed, the last blow of the bludgeon, another Sedan,
 only attended by circumstances of blacker infamy. And when he learned next
 day the occurrences at the Hotel de Ville&mdash;how the insurgents had
 been for a brief time successful, how the members of the Government of
 National Defense had been made prisoners and held until four o'clock in
 the morning, how finally the fickle populace, swayed at one moment by
 detestation for the ministers and at the next terrified by the prospect of
 a successful revolution, had released them&mdash;he was filled with regret
 at the miscarriage of the attempt, at the non-success of the Commune,
 which might have been their salvation, calling the people to arms, warning
 them of the country's danger, arousing the cherished memories of a nation
 that wills it will not perish. Thiers did not dare even to set his foot in
 Paris, where there was some attempt at illumination to celebrate the
 failure of the negotiations.
 </p>
 <p>
 The month of November was to Maurice a period of feverish expectancy.
 There were some conflicts of no great importance, in which he had no
 share. His regiment was in cantonments at the time in the vicinity of
 Saint-Ouen, whence he made his escape as often as he could to satisfy his
 craving for news. Paris, like him, was awaiting the issue of events in
 eager suspense. The election of municipal officers seemed to have appeased
 political passion for the time being, but a circumstance that boded no
 good for the future was that those elected were rabid adherents of one or
 another party. And what Paris was watching and praying for in that
 interval of repose was the grand sortie that was to bring them victory and
 deliverance. As it had always been, so it was now; confidence reigned
 everywhere: they would drive the Prussians from their position, would
 pulverize them, annihilate them. Great preparations were being made in the
 peninsula of Gennevilliers, the point where there was most likelihood of
 the operation being attended with success. Then one morning came the
 joyful tidings of the victory at Coulmiers; Orleans was recaptured, the
 army of the Loire was marching to the relief of Paris, was even then, so
 it was reported, in camp at Etampes. The aspect of affairs was entirely
 changed: all they had to do now was to go and effect a junction with it
 beyond the Marne. There had been a general reorganization of the forces;
 three armies had been created, one composed of the battalions of National
 Guards and commanded by General Clement Thomas, another, comprising the
 13th and 14th corps, to which were added a few reliable regiments,
 selected indiscriminately wherever they could be found, was to form the
 main column of attack under the lead of General Ducrot, while the third,
 intended to act as a reserve, was made up entirely of mobiles and turned
 over to General Vinoy. And when Maurice laid him down to sleep in the wood
 of Vincennes on the night of the 28th of November, with his comrades of
 the 115th, he was without a doubt of their success. The three corps of the
 second army were all there, and it was common talk that their junction
 with the army of the Loire had been fixed for the following day at
 Fontainebleau. Then ensued a series of mischances, the usual blunders
 arising from want of foresight; a sudden rising of the river, which
 prevented the engineers from laying the pontoon bridge; conflicting
 orders, which delayed the movement of the troops. The 115th was among the
 first regiments to pass the river on the following night, and in the
 neighborhood of ten o'clock, with Maurice in its ranks, it entered
 Champigny under a destructive fire. The young man was wild with
 excitement; he fired so rapidly that his chassepot burned his fingers,
 notwithstanding the intense cold. His sole thought was to push onward,
 ever onward, surmounting every obstacle until they should join their
 brothers from the provinces over there across the river. But in front of
 Champigny and Bry the army fell up against the park walls of Coeuilly and
 Villiers, that the Prussians had converted into impregnable fortresses,
 more than a quarter of a mile in length. The men's courage faltered, and
 after that the action went on in a half-hearted way; the 3d corps was slow
 in getting up, the 1st and 2d, unable to advance, continued for two days
 longer to hold Champigny, which they finally abandoned on the night of
 December 2, after their barren victory. The whole army retired to the wood
 of Vincennes, where the men's only shelter was the snow-laden branches of
 the trees, and Maurice, whose feet were frost-bitten, laid his head upon
 the cold ground and cried.
 </p>
 <p>
 The gloom and dejection that reigned in the city, after the failure of
 that supreme effort, beggars the powers of description. The great sortie
 that had been so long in preparation, the irresistible eruption that was
 to be the deliverance of Paris, had ended in disappointment, and three
 days later came a communication from General von Moltke under a flag of
 truce, announcing that the army of the Loire had been defeated and that
 the German flag again waved over Orleans. The girdle was being drawn
 tighter and tighter about the doomed city all whose struggles were
 henceforth powerless to burst its iron fetters. But Paris seemed to
 accumulate fresh powers of resistance in the delirium of its despair. It
 was certain that ere long they would have to count famine among the number
 of their foes. As early as October the people had been restricted in their
 consumption of butcher's meat, and in December, of all the immense herds
 of beeves and flocks of sheep that had been turned loose in the Bois de
 Boulogne, there was not a single creature left alive, and horses were
 being slaughtered for food. The stock of flour and wheat, with what was
 subsequently taken for the public use by forced sale, it was estimated
 would keep the city supplied with bread for four months. When the flour
 was all consumed mills were erected in the railway stations to grind the
 grain. The supply of coal, too, was giving out; it was reserved to bake
 the bread and for use in the mills and arms factories. And Paris, her
 streets without gas and lighted by petroleum lamps at infrequent
 intervals; Paris, shivering under her icy mantle; Paris, to whom the
 authorities doled out her scanty daily ration of black bread and horse
 flesh, continued to hope&mdash;in spite of all, talking of Faidherbe in
 the north, of Chanzy on the Loire, of Bourbaki in the east, as if their
 victorious armies were already beneath the walls. The men and women who
 stood waiting, their feet in snow and slush, in interminable lines before
 the bakers' and butchers' shops, brightened up a bit at times at the news
 of some imaginary success of the army. After the discouragement of each
 defeat the unquenchable flame of their illusion would burst out and blaze
 more brightly than ever among those wretched people, whom starvation and
 every kind of suffering had rendered almost delirious. A soldier on the
 Place du Chateau d'Eau having spoken of surrender, the by-standers mobbed
 and were near killing him. While the army, its endurance exhausted,
 feeling the end was near, called for peace, the populace clamored still
 for the sortie <i>en masse</i>, the torrential sortie, in which the entire
 population of the capital, men, women, and children, even, should take
 part, rushing upon the Prussians like water from a broken dyke and
 overwhelming them by sheer force of numbers.

 And Maurice kept himself apart from his comrades, with an ever-increasing
 disgust for the life and duties of a soldier, that condemned him to
 inactivity and uselessness behind the ramparts of Mont-Valerien. He
 grasped every occasion to get away and hasten to Paris, where his heart
 was. It was in the midst of the great city's thronging masses alone that
 he found rest and peace of mind; he tried to force himself to hope as they
 hoped. He often went to witness the departure of the balloons, which were
 sent up every other day from the station of the Northern Railway with a
 freight of despatches and carrier pigeons. They rose when the ropes were
 cast loose and soon were lost to sight in the cheerless wintry sky, and
 all hearts were filled with anguish when the wind wafted them in the
 direction of the German frontier. Many of them were never heard of more.
 He had himself twice written to his sister Henriette, without ever
 learning if she had received his letters. The memory of his sister and of
 Jean, living as they did in that outer, shadowy world from which no
 tidings ever reached him now, was become so blurred and faint that he
 thought of them but seldom, as of affections that he had left behind him
 in some previous existence. The incessant conflict of despair and hope in
 which he lived occupied all the faculties of his being too fully to leave
 room for mere human feelings. Then, too, in the early days of January he
 was goaded to the verge of frenzy by the action of the enemy in shelling
 the district on the left bank of the river. He had come to credit the
 Prussians with reasons of humanity for their abstention, which was in fact
 due simply to the difficulties they experienced in bringing up their guns
 and getting them in position. Now that a shell had killed two little girls
 at the Val-de-Grace, his scorn and hatred knew no bounds for those
 barbarous ruffians who murdered little children and threatened to burn the
 libraries and museums. After the first days of terror, however, Paris had
 resumed its life of dogged, unfaltering heroism.
 </p>
 <p>
 Since the reverse of Champigny there had been but one other attempt,
 ending in disaster like the rest, in the direction of Bourget; and the
 evening when the plateau of Avron was evacuated, under the fire of the
 heavy siege artillery battering away at the forts, Maurice was a sharer in
 the rage and exasperation that possessed the entire city. The growing
 unpopularity that threatened to hurl from power General Trochu and the
 Government of National Defense was so augmented by this additional repulse
 that they were compelled to attempt a supreme and hopeless effort. What,
 did they refuse the services of the three hundred thousand National
 Guards, who from the beginning had been demanding their share in the peril
 and in the victory! This time it was to be the torrential sortie that had
 all along been the object of the popular clamor; Paris was to throw open
 its dikes and drown the Prussians beneath the on-pouring waves of its
 children. Notwithstanding the certainty of a fresh defeat, there was no
 way of avoiding a demand that had its origin in such patriotic motives;
 but in order to limit the slaughter as far as possible, the chiefs
 determined to employ, in connection with the regular army, only the
 fifty-nine mobilized battalions of the National Guard. The day preceding
 the 19th of January resembled some great public holiday; an immense crowd
 gathered on the boulevards and in the Champs-Elysees to witness the
 departing regiments, which marched proudly by, preceded by their bands,
 the men thundering out patriotic airs. Women and children followed them
 along the sidewalk, men climbed on the benches to wish them Godspeed. The
 next morning the entire population of the city hurried out to the Arc de
 Triomphe, and it was almost frantic with delight when at an early hour
 news came of the capture of Montretout; the tales that were told of the
 gallant behavior of the National Guard sounded like epics; the Prussians
 had been beaten all along the line, the French would occupy Versailles
 before night. As a natural result the consternation was proportionately
 great when, at nightfall, the inevitable defeat became known. While the
 left wing was seizing Montretout the center, which had succeeded in
 carrying the outer wall of Buzanval Park, had encountered a second inner
 wall, before which it broke. A thaw had set in, the roads were heavy from
 the effects of a fine, drizzling rain, and the guns, those guns that had
 been cast by popular subscription and were to the Parisians as the apple
 of their eye, could not get up. On the right General Ducrot's column was
 tardy in getting into action and saw nothing of the fight. Further effort
 was useless, and General Trochu was compelled to order a retreat.
 Montretout was abandoned, and Saint-Cloud as well, which the Prussians
 burned, and when it became fully dark the horizon of Paris was illuminated
 by the conflagration.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice himself this time felt that the end was come. For four hours he
 had remained in the park of Buzanval with the National Guards under the
 galling fire from the Prussian intrenchments, and later, when he got back
 to the city, he spoke of their courage in the highest terms. It was
 undisputed that the Guards fought bravely on that occasion; after that was
 it not self-evident that all the disasters of the army were to be
 attributed solely to the imbecility and treason of its leaders? In the Rue
 de Rivoli he encountered bands of men shouting: "Hurrah for the Commune!
 down with Trochu!" It was the leaven of revolution beginning to work again
 in the popular mind, a fresh outbreak of public opinion, and so formidable
 this time that the Government of National Defense, in order to preserve
 its own existence, thought it necessary to compel General Trochu's
 resignation and put General Vinoy in his place. On that same day Maurice,
 chancing to enter a hall in Belleville where a public meeting was going
 on, again heard the <i>levee en masse</i> demanded with clamorous shouts.
 He knew the thing to be chimerical, and yet it set his heart a-beating
 more rapidly to see such a determined will to conquer. When all is ended,
 is it not left us to attempt the impossible? All that night he dreamed of
 miracles.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then a long week went by, during which Paris lay agonizing without a
 murmur. The shops had ceased to open their doors; in the lonely streets
 the infrequent wayfarer never met a carriage. Forty thousand horses had
 been eaten; dogs, cats and rats were now luxuries, commanding a high
 price. Ever since the supply of wheat had given out the bread was made
 from rice and oats, and was black, damp, and slimy, and hard to digest; to
 obtain the ten ounces that constituted a day's ration involved a wait,
 often of many hours, in line before the bake-house. Ah, the sorrowful
 spectacle it was, to see those poor women shivering in the pouring rain,
 their feet in the ice-cold mud and water! the misery and heroism of the
 great city that would not surrender! The death rate had increased
 threefold; the theaters were converted into hospitals. As soon as it
 became dark the quarters where luxury and vice had formerly held carnival
 were shrouded in funereal blackness, like the faubourgs of some accursed
 city, smitten by pestilence. And in that silence, in that obscurity,
 naught was to be heard save the unceasing roar of the cannonade and the
 crash of bursting shells, naught to be seen save the red flash of the guns
 illuminating the wintry sky.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the 28th of January the news burst on Paris like a thunderclap that for
 the past two days negotiations had been going on, between Jules Favre and
 M. von Bismarck, looking to an armistice, and at the same time it learned
 that there was bread for only ten days longer, a space of time that would
 hardly suffice to revictual the city. Capitulation was become a matter of
 material necessity. Paris, stupefied by the hard truths that were imparted
 to it at that late day, remained sullenly silent and made no sign.
 Midnight of that day heard the last shot from the German guns, and on the
 29th, when the Prussians had taken possession of the forts, Maurice went
 with his regiment into the camp that was assigned them over by Montrouge,
 within the fortifications. The life that he led there was an aimless one,
 made up of idleness and feverish unrest. Discipline was relaxed; the
 soldiers did pretty much as they pleased, waiting in inactivity to be
 dismissed to their homes. He, however, continued to hang around the camp
 in a semi-dazed condition, moody, nervous, irritable, prompt to take
 offense on the most trivial provocation. He read with avidity all the
 revolutionary newspapers he could lay hands on; that three weeks'
 armistice, concluded solely for the purpose of allowing France to elect an
 assembly that should ratify the conditions of peace, appeared to him a
 delusion and a snare, another and a final instance of treason. Even if
 Paris were forced to capitulate, he was with Gambetta for the prosecution
 of the war in the north and on the line of the Loire. He overflowed with
 indignation at the disaster of Bourbaki's army in the east, which had been
 compelled to throw itself into Switzerland, and the result of the
 elections made him furious: it would be just as he had always predicted;
 the base, cowardly provinces, irritated by Paris' protracted resistance,
 would insist on peace at any price and restore the monarchy while the
 Prussian guns were still directed on the city. After the first sessions,
 at Bordeaux, Thiers, elected in twenty-six departments and constituted by
 unanimous acclaim the chief executive, appeared to his eyes a monster of
 iniquity, the father of lies, a man capable of every crime. The terms of
 the peace concluded by that assemblage of monarchists seemed to him to put
 the finishing touch to their infamy, his blood boiled merely at the
 thought of those hard conditions: an indemnity of five milliards, Metz to
 be given up, Alsace to be ceded, France's blood and treasure pouring from
 the gaping wound, thenceforth incurable, that was thus opened in her
 flank.
 </p>
 <p>
 Late in February Maurice, unable to endure his situation longer, made up
 his mind he would desert. A stipulation of the treaty provided that the
 troops encamped about Paris should be disarmed and returned to their
 abodes, but he did not wait to see it enforced; it seemed to him that it
 would break his heart to leave brave, glorious Paris, which only famine
 had been able to subdue, and so he bade farewell to army life and hired
 for himself a small furnished room next the roof of a tall apartment house
 in the Rue des Orties, at the top of the butte des Moulins, whence he had
 an outlook over the immense sea of roofs from the Tuileries to the
 Bastille. An old friend, whom he had known while pursuing his law studies,
 had loaned him a hundred francs. In addition to that he had caused his
 name to be inscribed on the roster of a battalion of National Guards as
 soon as he was settled in his new quarters, and his pay, thirty sous a
 day, would be enough to keep him alive. The idea of going to the country
 and there leading a tranquil life, unmindful of what was happening to the
 country, filled him with horror; the letters even that he received from
 his sister Henriette, to whom he had written immediately after the
 armistice, annoyed him by their tone of entreaty, their ardent
 solicitations that he would come home to Remilly and rest. He refused
 point-blank; he would go later on when the Prussians should be no longer
 there.
 </p>
 <p>
 And so Maurice went on leading an idle, vagabondish sort of life, in a
 state of constant feverish agitation. He had ceased to be tormented by
 hunger; he devoured the first white bread he got with infinite gusto; but
 the city was a prison still: German guards were posted at the gates, and
 no one was allowed to pass them until he had been made to give an account
 of himself. There had been no resumption of social life as yet; industry
 and trade were at a standstill; the people lived from day to day, watching
 to see what would happen next, doing nothing, simply vegetating in the
 bright sunshine of the spring that was now coming on apace. During the
 siege there had been the military service to occupy men's minds and tire
 their limbs, while now the entire population, isolated from all the world,
 had suddenly been reduced to a state of utter stagnation, mental as well
 as physical. He did as others did, loitering his time away from morning
 till night, living in an atmosphere that for months had been vitiated by
 the germs arising from the half-crazed mob. He read the newspapers and was
 an assiduous frequenter of public meetings, where he would often smile and
 shrug his shoulders at the rant and fustian of the speakers, but
 nevertheless would go away with the most ultra notions teeming in his
 brain, ready to engage in any desperate undertaking in the defense of what
 he considered truth and justice. And sitting by the window in his little
 bedroom, and looking out over the city, he would still beguile himself
 with dreams of victory; would tell himself that France and the Republic
 might yet be saved, so long as the treaty of peace remained unsigned.
 </p>
 <p>
 The 1st of March was the day fixed for the entrance of the Prussians into
 Paris, and a long-drawn howl of wrath and execration went up from every
 heart. Maurice never attended a meeting now that he did not hear Thiers,
 the Assembly, even the men of September 4th themselves, cursed and reviled
 because they had not spared the great heroic city that crowning
 degradation. He was himself one night aroused to such a pitch of frenzy
 that he took the floor and shouted that it was the duty of all Paris to go
 and die on the ramparts rather than suffer the entrance of a single
 Prussian. It was quite natural that the spirit of insurrection should show
 itself thus, should bud and blossom in the full light of day, among that
 populace that had first been maddened by months of distress and famine and
 then had found itself reduced to a condition of idleness that afforded it
 abundant leisure to brood on the suspicions and fancied wrongs that were
 largely the product of its own disordered imagination. It was one of those
 moral crises that have been noticed as occurring after every great siege,
 in which excessive patriotism, thwarted in its aims and aspirations, after
 having fired men's minds, degenerates into a blind rage for vengeance and
 destruction. The Central Committee, elected by delegates from the National
 Guard battalions, had protested against any attempt to disarm their
 constituents. Then came an immense popular demonstration on the Place de
 la Bastille, where there were red flags, incendiary speeches and a crowd
 that overflowed the square, the affair ending with the murder of a poor
 inoffensive agent of police, who was bound to a plank, thrown into the
 canal, and then stoned to death. And forty-eight hours later, during the
 night of the 26th of February, Maurice, awakened by the beating of the
 long roll and the sound of the tocsin, beheld bands of men and women
 streaming along the Boulevard des Batignolles and dragging cannon after
 them. He descended to the street, and laying hold of the rope of a gun
 along with some twenty others, was told how the people had gone to the
 Place Wagram and taken the pieces in order that the Assembly might not
 deliver them to the Prussians. There were seventy of them; teams were
 wanting, but the strong arms of the mob, tugging at the ropes and pushing
 at the limbers and axles, finally brought them to the summit of Montmartre
 with the mad impetuosity of a barbarian horde assuring the safety of its
 idols. When on March 1 the Prussians took possession of the quarter of the
 Champs Elysees, which they were to occupy only for one day, keeping
 themselves strictly within the limits of the barriers, Paris looked on in
 sullen silence, its streets deserted, its houses closed, the entire city
 lifeless and shrouded in its dense veil of mourning.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two weeks more went by, during which Maurice could hardly have told how he
 spent his time while awaiting the approach of the momentous events of
 which he had a distinct presentiment. Peace was concluded definitely at
 last, the Assembly was to commence its regular sessions at Versailles on
 the 20th of the month; and yet for him nothing was concluded: he felt that
 they were ere long to witness the beginning of a dreadful drama of
 atonement. On the 18th of March, as he was about to leave his room, he
 received a letter from Henriette urging him to come and join her at
 Remilly, coupled with a playful threat that she would come and carry him
 off with her if he delayed too long to afford her that great pleasure.
 Then she went on to speak of Jean, concerning whose affairs she was
 extremely anxious; she told how, after leaving her late in December to
 join the Army of the North, he had been seized with a low fever that had
 kept him long a prisoner in a Belgian hospital, and only the preceding
 week he had written her that he was about to start for Paris,
 notwithstanding his enfeebled condition, where he was determined to seek
 active service once again. Henriette closed her letter by begging her
 brother to give her a faithful account of how matters were with Jean as
 soon as he should have seen him. Maurice laid the open letter before him
 on the table and sank into a confused revery. Henriette, Jean; his sister
 whom he loved so fondly, his brother in suffering and privation; how
 absent from his daily thoughts had those dear ones been since the tempest
 had been raging in his bosom! He aroused himself, however, and as his
 sister advised him that she had been unable to give Jean the number of the
 house in the Rue des Orties, promised himself to go that very day to the
 office where the regimental records were kept and hunt up his friend. But
 he had barely got beyond his door and was crossing the Rue Saint-Honore
 when he encountered two fellow-soldiers of his battalion, who gave him an
 account of what had happened that morning and during the night before at
 Montmartre, and the three men started off on a run toward the scene of the
 disturbance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ah, that day of the 18th of March, the elation and enthusiasm that it
 aroused in Maurice! In after days he could never remember clearly what he
 said and did. First he beheld himself dimly, as through a veil of mist,
 convulsed with rage at the recital of how the troops had attempted, in the
 darkness and quiet that precedes the dawn, to disarm Paris by seizing the
 guns on Montmartre heights. It was evident that Thiers, who had arrived
 from Bordeaux, had been meditating the blow for the last two days, in
 order that the Assembly at Versailles might proceed without fear to
 proclaim the monarchy. Then the scene shifted, and he was on the ground at
 Montmartre itself&mdash;about nine o'clock it was&mdash;fired by the
 narrative of the people's victory: how the soldiery had come sneaking up
 in the darkness, how the delay in bringing up the teams had given the
 National Guards an opportunity to fly to arms, the troops, having no heart
 to fire on women and children, reversing their muskets and fraternizing
 with the people. Then he had wandered desultorily about the city, wherever
 chance directed his footsteps, and by midday had satisfied himself that
 the Commune was master of Paris, without even the necessity of striking a
 blow, for Thiers and the ministers had decamped from their quarters in the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the entire government was flying in disorder
 to Versailles, the thirty thousand troops had been hastily conducted from
 the city, leaving more than five thousand deserters from their numbers
 along the line of their retreat. And later, about half-past five in the
 afternoon, he could recall being at a corner of the exterior boulevard in
 the midst of a mob of howling lunatics, listening without the slightest
 evidence of disapproval to the abominable story of the murder of Generals
 Lecomte and Clement Thomas. Generals, they called themselves; fine
 generals, they! The leaders they had had at Sedan rose before his memory,
 voluptuaries and imbeciles; one more, one less, what odds did it make! And
 the remainder of the day passed in the same state of half-crazed
 excitement, which served to distort everything to his vision; it was an
 insurrection that the very stones of the streets seemed to have favored,
 spreading, swelling, finally becoming master of all at a stroke in the
 unforeseen fatality of its triumph, and at ten o'clock in the evening
 delivering the Hotel de Ville over to the members of the Central
 Committee, who were greatly surprised to find themselves there.
 </p>
 <p>
 There was one memory, however, that remained very distinct to Maurice's
 mind: his unexpected meeting with Jean. It was three days now since the
 latter had reached Paris, without a sou in his pocket, emaciated and
 enfeebled by the illness that had consigned him to a hospital in Brussels
 and kept him there two months, and having had the luck to fall in with
 Captain Ravaud, who had commanded a company in the 106th, he had enlisted
 at once in his former acquaintance's new company in the 124th. His old
 rank as corporal had been restored to him, and that evening he had just
 left the Prince Eugene barracks with his squad on his way to the left
 bank, where the entire army was to concentrate, when a mob collected about
 his men and stopped them as they were passing along the boulevard
 Saint-Martin. The insurgents yelled and shouted, and evidently were
 preparing to disarm his little band. With perfect coolness he told them to
 let him alone, that he had no business with them or their affairs; all he
 wanted was to obey his orders without harming anybody. Then a cry of glad
 surprise was heard, and Maurice, who had chanced to pass that way, threw
 himself on the other's neck and gave him a brotherly hug.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, is it you! My sister wrote me about you. And just think, no later
 than this very morning I was going to look you up at the war office!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's eyes were dim with big tears of pleasure.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, my dear lad how glad I am to see you once more! I have been looking
 for you, too, but where could a fellow expect to find you in this
 confounded great big place?"
 </p>
 <p>
 To the crowd, continuing their angry muttering, Maurice turned and said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let me talk to them, citizens! They're good fellows; I'll answer for
 them." He took his friend's hands in his, and lowering his voice: "You'll
 join us, won't you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean's face was the picture of surprise. "How, join you? I don't
 understand." Then for a moment he listened while Maurice railed against
 the government, against the army, raking up old sores and recalling all
 their sufferings, telling how at last they were going to be masters,
 punish dolts and cowards and preserve the Republic. And as he struggled to
 get the problems the other laid before him through his brain, the tranquil
 face of the unlettered peasant was clouded with an increasing sorrow. "Ah,
 no! ah, no! my boy. I can't join you if it's for that fine work you want
 me. My captain told me to go with my men to Vaugirard, and there I'm
 going. In spite of the devil and his angels I will go there. That's
 natural enough; you ought to know how it is yourself." He laughed with
 frank simplicity and added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It's you who'll come along with us."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice released his hands with an angry gesture of dissent, and thus
 they stood for some seconds, face to face, one under the influence of that
 madness that was sweeping all Paris off its feet, the malady that had been
 bequeathed to them by the crimes and follies of the late reign, the other
 strong in his ignorance and practical common sense, untainted as yet
 because he had grown up apart from the contaminating principle, in the
 land where industry and thrift were honored. They were brothers, however,
 none the less; the tie that united them was strong, and it was a pang to
 them both when the crowd suddenly surged forward and parted them.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, Maurice!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, Jean!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was a regiment, the 79th, debouching from a side street, that had
 caused the movement among the crowd, forcing the rioters back to the
 sidewalks by the weight of its compact column, closed in mass. There was
 some hooting, but no one ventured to bar the way against the soldier boys,
 who went by at double time, well under control of their officers. An
 opportunity was afforded the little squad of the 124th to make their
 escape, and they followed in the wake of the larger body.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, Jean!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Au revoir</i>, Maurice!"
 </p>
 <p>
 They waved their hands once more in a parting salute, yielding to the
 fatality that decreed their separation in that manner, but each none the
 less securely seated in the other's heart.
 </p>
 <p>
 The extraordinary occurrences of the next and the succeeding days crowded
 on the heels of one another in such swift sequence that Maurice had
 scarcely time to think. On the morning of the 19th Paris awoke without a
 government, more surprised than frightened to learn that a panic during
 the night had sent army, ministers, and all the public service scurrying
 away to Versailles, and as the weather happened to be fine on that
 magnificent March Sunday, Paris stepped unconcernedly down into the
 streets to have a look at the barricades. A great white poster, bearing
 the signature of the Central Committee and convoking the people for the
 communal elections, attracted attention by the moderation of its language,
 although much surprise was expressed at seeing it signed by names so
 utterly unknown. There can be no doubt that at this incipient stage of the
 Commune Paris, in the bitter memory of what it had endured, in the
 suspicions by which it was haunted, and in its unslaked thirst for further
 fighting, was against Versailles. It was a condition of absolute anarchy,
 moreover, the conflict for the moment being between the mayors and the
 Central Committee, the former fruitlessly attempting to introduce measures
 of conciliation, while the latter, uncertain as yet to what extent it
 could rely on the federated National Guard, continued modestly to lay
 claim to no higher title than that of defender of the municipal liberties.
 The shots fired against the pacific demonstration in the Place Vendome,
 the few corpses whose blood reddened the pavements, first sent a thrill of
 terror circulating through the city. And while these things were going on,
 while the insurgents were taking definite possession of the ministries and
 all the public buildings, the agitation, rage and alarm prevailing at
 Versailles were extreme, the government there hastening to get together
 sufficient troops to repel the attack which they felt sure they should not
 have to wait for long. The steadiest and most reliable divisions of the
 armies of the North and of the Loire were hurried forward. Ten days
 sufficed to collect a force of nearly eighty thousand men, and the tide of
 returning confidence set in so strongly that on the 2d of April two
 divisions opened hostilities by taking from the federates Puteaux and
 Courbevoie.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not until the day following the events just mentioned that Maurice,
 starting out with his battalion to effect the conquest of Versailles,
 beheld, amid the throng of misty, feverish memories that rose to his poor
 wearied brain, Jean's melancholy face as he had seen it last, and seemed
 to hear the tones of his last mournful <i>au revoir</i>. The military
 operations of the Versaillese had filled the National Guard with alarm and
 indignation; three columns, embracing a total strength of fifty thousand
 men, had gone storming that morning through Bougival and Meudon on their
 way to seize the monarchical Assembly and Thiers, the murderer. It was the
 torrential sortie that had been demanded with such insistence during the
 siege, and Maurice asked himself where he should ever see Jean again
 unless among the dead lying on the field of battle down yonder. But it was
 not long before he knew the result; his battalion had barely reached the
 Plateau des Bergeres, on the road to Reuil, when the shells from
 Mont-Valerien came tumbling among the ranks. Universal consternation
 reigned; some had supposed that the fort was held by their comrades of the
 Guard, while others averred that the commander had promised solemnly to
 withhold his fire. A wild panic seized upon the men; the battalions broke
 and rushed back to Paris fast as their legs would let them, while the head
 of the column, diverted by a flanking movement of General Vinoy, was
 driven back on Reuil and cut to pieces there.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Maurice, who had escaped unharmed from the slaughter, his nerves
 still quivering with the fury that had inspired him on the battlefield,
 was filled with fresh detestation for that so-called government of law and
 order which always allowed itself to be beaten by the Prussians, and could
 only muster up a little courage when it came to oppressing Paris. And the
 German armies were still there, from Saint-Denis to Charenton, watching
 the shameful spectacle of internecine conflict! Thus, in the fierce
 longing for vengeance and destruction that animated him, he could not do
 otherwise than sanction the first measures of communistic violence, the
 building of barricades in the streets and public squares, the arrest of
 the archbishop, some priests, and former officeholders, who were to be
 held as hostages. The atrocities that distinguished either side in that
 horrible conflict were already beginning to manifest themselves,
 Versailles shooting the prisoners it made, Paris retaliating with a decree
 that for each one of its soldiers murdered three hostages should forfeit
 their life. The horror of it, that fratricidal conflict, that wretched
 nation completing the work of destruction by devouring its own children!
 And the little reason that remained to Maurice, in the ruin of all the
 things he had hitherto held sacred, was quickly dissipated in the
 whirlwind of blind fury that swept all before it. In his eyes the Commune
 was to be the avenger of all the wrongs they had suffered, the liberator,
 coming with fire and sword to purify and punish. He was not quite clear in
 mind about it all, but remembered having read how great and flourishing
 the old free cities had become, how wealthy provinces had federated and
 imposed their law upon the world. If Paris should be victorious he beheld
 her, crowned with an aureole of glory, building up a new France, where
 liberty and justice should be the watchwords, organizing a new society,
 having first swept away the rotten debris of the old. It was true that
 when the result of the elections became known he was somewhat surprised by
 the strange mixture of moderates, revolutionists, and socialists of every
 sect and shade to whom the accomplishment of the great work was intrusted;
 he was acquainted with several of the men and knew them to be of extremely
 mediocre abilities. Would not the strongest among them come in collision
 and neutralize one another amid the clashing ideas which they represented?
 But on the day when the ceremony of the inauguration of the Commune took
 place before the Hotel de Ville, amid the thunder of artillery and
 trophies and red banners floating in the air, his boundless hopes again
 got the better of his fears and he ceased to doubt. Among the lies of some
 and the unquestioning faith of others, the illusion started into life
 again with renewed vigor, in the acute crisis of the malady raised to
 paroxysmal pitch.
 </p>
 <p>
 During the entire month of April Maurice was on duty in the neighborhood
 of Neuilly. The gentle warmth of the early spring had brought out the
 blossoms on the lilacs, and the fighting was conducted among the bright
 verdure of the gardens; the National Guards came into the city at night
 with bouquets of flowers stuck in their muskets. The troops collected at
 Versailles were now so numerous as to warrant their formation in two
 armies, a first line under the orders of Marshal MacMahon and a reserve
 commanded by General Vinoy. The Commune had nearly a hundred thousand
 National Guards mobilized and as many more on the rosters who could be
 called out at short notice, but fifty thousand were as many as they ever
 brought into the field at one time. Day by day the plan of attack adopted
 by the Versaillese became more manifest: after occupying Neuilly they had
 taken possession of the Chateau of Becon and soon after of Asnieres, but
 these movements were simply to make the investment more complete, for
 their intention was to enter the city by the Point-du-Jour soon as the
 converging fire from Mont-Valerien and Fort d'Issy should enable them to
 carry the rampart there. Mont-Valerien was theirs already, and they were
 straining every nerve to capture Issy, utilizing the works abandoned by
 the Germans for the purpose. Since the middle of April the fire of
 musketry and artillery had been incessant; at Levallois and Neuilly the
 fighting never ceased, the skirmishers blazing away uninterruptedly, by
 night as well as by day. Heavy guns, mounted on armored cars, moved to and
 fro on the Belt Railway, shelling Asnieres over the roofs of Levallois. It
 was at Vanves and Issy, however, that the cannonade was fiercest; it shook
 the windows of Paris as the siege had done when it was at its height. And
 when finally, on the 9th of May, Fort d'Issy was obliged to succumb and
 fell into the hands of the Versailles army the defeat of the Commune was
 assured, and in their frenzy of panic the leaders resorted to most
 detestable measures.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice favored the creation of a Committee of Public Safety. The warnings
 of history came to his mind; had not the hour struck for adopting
 energetic methods if they wished to save the country? There was but one of
 their barbarities that really pained him, and that was the destruction of
 the Vendome column; he reproached himself for the feeling as being a
 childish weakness, but his grandfather's voice still sounded in his ears
 repeating the old familiar tales of Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau,
 Friedland, Wagram, the Moskowa&mdash;those epic narratives that thrilled
 his pulses yet as often as he thought of them. But that they should
 demolish the house of the murderer Thiers, that they should retain the
 hostages as a guarantee and a menace, was not that right and just when the
 Versaillese were unchaining their fury on Paris, bombarding it, destroying
 its edifices, slaughtering women and children with their shells? As he saw
 the end of his dream approaching dark thoughts of ruin and destruction
 filled his mind. If their ideas of justice and retribution were not to
 prevail, if they were to be crushed out of them with their life-blood,
 then perish the world, swept away in one of those cosmic upheavals that
 are the beginning of a new life. Let Paris sink beneath the waves, let it
 go up in smoke and flame, like a gigantic funeral pyre, sooner than let it
 be again delivered over to its former state of vice and misery, to that
 old vicious social system of abominable injustice. And he dreamed another
 dark, terrible dream, the great city reduced to ashes, naught to be seen
 on either side the Seine but piles of smoldering ruins, the festering
 wound purified and healed with fire, a catastrophe without a name, such as
 had never been before, whence should arise a new race. Wild stories were
 everywhere circulated, which interested him intensely, of the mines that
 were driven under all the quarters of the city, the barrels of powder with
 which the catacombs were stuffed, the monuments and public buildings ready
 to be blown into the air at a moment's notice; and all were connected by
 electric wires in such a way that a single spark would suffice to set them
 off; there were great stores of inflammable substances, too, especially
 petroleum, with which the streets and avenues were to be converted into
 seething lakes of flame. The Commune had sworn that should the Versaillese
 enter the city not one of them would ever get beyond the barricades that
 closed the ends of the streets; the pavements would yawn, the houses would
 sink in ruins, Paris would go up in flames, and bury assailants and
 assailed under its ashes.
 </p>
 <p>
 And if Maurice solaced himself with these crazy dreams, it was because of
 his secret discontent with the Commune itself. He had lost all confidence
 in its members, he felt it was inefficient, drawn this way and that by so
 many conflicting elements, losing its head and becoming purposeless and
 driveling as it saw the near approach of the peril with which it was
 menaced. Of the social reforms it had pledged itself to it had not been
 able to accomplish a single one, and it was now quite certain that it
 would leave behind it no great work to perpetuate its name. But what more
 than all beside was gnawing at its vitals was the rivalries by which it
 was distracted, the corroding suspicion and distrust in which each of its
 members lived. For some time past many of them, the more moderate and the
 timid, had ceased to attend its sessions. The others shaped their course
 day by day in accordance with events, trembling at the idea of a possible
 dictatorship; they had reached that point where the factions of
 revolutionary assemblages exterminate one another by way of saving the
 country. Cluzeret had become suspected, then Dombrowski, and Rossel was
 about to share their fate. Delescluze, appointed Civil Delegate at War,
 could do nothing of his own volition, notwithstanding his great authority.
 And thus the grand social effort that they had had in view wasted itself
 in the ever-widening isolation about those men, whose power had become a
 nullity, whose actions were the result of their despair.
 </p>
 <p>
 In Paris there was an increasing feeling of terror. Paris, irritated at
 first against Versailles, shivering at the recollection of what it had
 suffered during the siege, was now breaking away from the Commune. The
 compulsory enrollment, the decree incorporating every man under forty in
 the National Guard, had angered the more sedate citizens and been the
 means of bringing about a general exodus: men in disguise and provided
 with forged papers of Alsatian citizenship made their escape by way of
 Saint-Denis; others let themselves down into the moat in the darkness of
 the night with ropes and ladders. The wealthy had long since taken their
 departure. None of the factories and workshops had opened their doors;
 trade and commerce there was none; there was no employment for labor; the
 life of enforced idleness went on amid the alarmed expectancy of the
 frightful denouement that everyone felt could not be far away. And the
 people depended for their daily bread on the pay of the National Guards,
 that dole of thirty sous that was paid from the millions extorted from the
 Bank of France, the thirty sous for the sake of which alone many men were
 wearing the uniform, which had been one of the primary causes and the <i>raison
 d'etre</i> of the insurrection. Whole districts were deserted, the shops
 closed, the house-fronts lifeless. In the bright May sunshine that flooded
 the empty streets the few pedestrians beheld nothing moving save the
 barbaric display of the burial of some federates killed in action, the
 funeral train where no priest walked, the hearse draped with red flags,
 followed by a crowd of men and women bearing bouquets of immortelles. The
 churches were closed and did duty each evening as political club-rooms.
 The revolutionary journals alone were hawked about the streets; the others
 had been suppressed. Great Paris was indeed an unhappy city in those days,
 what with its republican sympathies that made it detest the monarchical
 Assembly at Versailles and its ever-increasing terror of the Commune, from
 which it prayed most fervently to be delivered among all the grisly
 stories that were current, the daily arrests of citizens as hostages, the
 casks of gunpowder that filled the sewers, where men patrolled by day and
 night awaiting the signal to apply the torch.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who had never been a drinking man, allowed himself to be seduced
 by the too prevalent habit of over-indulgence. It had become a thing of
 frequent occurrence with him now, when he was out on picket duty or had to
 spend the night in barracks, to take a "pony" of brandy, and if he took a
 second it was apt to go to his head in the alcohol-laden atmosphere that
 he was forced to breathe. It had become epidemic, that chronic
 drunkenness, among those men with whom bread was scarce and who could have
 all the brandy they wanted by asking for it. Toward evening on Sunday, the
 21st of May, Maurice came home drunk, for the first time in his life, to
 his room in the Rue des Orties, where he was in the habit of sleeping
 occasionally. He had been at Neuilly again that day, blazing away at the
 enemy and taking a nip now and then with the comrades, to see if it would
 not relieve the terrible fatigue from which he was suffering. Then, with a
 light head and heavy legs, he came and threw himself on the bed in his
 little chamber; it must have been through force of instinct, for he could
 never remember how he got there. And it was not until the following
 morning, when the sun was high in the heavens, that he awoke, aroused by
 the ringing of the alarm bells, the blare of trumpets and beating of
 drums. During the night the Versaillese, finding a gate undefended, had
 effected an unresisted entrance at the Point-du-Jour.
 </p>
 <p>
 When he had thrown on his clothes and hastened down into the street, his
 musket slung across his shoulder by the strap, a band of frightened
 soldiers whom he fell in with at the <i>mairie</i> of the arrondissement
 related to him the occurrences of the night, in the midst of a confusion
 such that at first he had hard work to understand. Fort d'Issy and the
 great battery at Montretout, seconded by Mont Valerien, for the last ten
 days had been battering the rampart at the Point-du-Jour, as a consequence
 of which the Saint-Cloud gate was no longer tenable and an assault had
 been ordered for the following morning, the 22d; but someone who chanced
 to pass that way at about five o'clock perceived that the gate was
 unprotected and immediately notified the guards in the trenches, who were
 not more than fifty yards away. Two companies of the 37th regiment of
 regulars were the first to enter the city, and were quickly followed by
 the entire 4th corps under General Douay. All night long the troops were
 pouring in in an uninterrupted stream. At seven o'clock Verge's division
 marched down to the bridge at Grenelle, crossed, and pushed on to the
 Trocadero. At nine General Clinchamp was master of Passy and la Muette. At
 three o'clock in the morning the 1st corps had pitched its tents in the
 Bois de Boulogne, while at about the same hour Bruat's division was
 passing the Seine to seize the Sevres gate and facilitate the movement of
 the 2d Corps, General de Cissey's, which occupied the district of Grenelle
 an hour later. The Versailles army, therefore, on the morning of the 22d,
 was master of the Trocadero and the Chateau of la Muette on the right
 bank, and of Grenelle on the left; and great was the rage and
 consternation that prevailed among the Communists, who were already
 accusing one another of treason, frantic at the thought of their
 inevitable defeat.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Maurice at last understood the condition of affairs his first thought
 was that the end had come, that all left him was to go forth and meet his
 death. But the tocsin was pealing, drums were beating, women and children,
 even, were working on the barricades, the streets were alive with the stir
 and bustle of the battalions hurrying to assume the positions assigned
 them in the coming conflict. By midday it was seen that the Versaillese
 were remaining quiet in their new positions, and then fresh courage
 returned to the hearts of the soldiers of the Commune, who were resolved
 to conquer or die. The enemy's army, which they had feared to see in
 possession of the Tuileries by that time, profiting by the stern lessons
 of experience and imitating the prudent tactics of the Prussians,
 conducted its operations with the utmost caution. The Committee of Public
 Safety and Delescluze, Delegate at War, directed the defense from their
 quarters in the Hotel de Ville. It was reported that a last proposal for a
 peaceable arrangement had been rejected by them with disdain. That served
 to inspire the men with still more courage, the triumph of Paris was
 assured, the resistance would be as unyielding as the attack was
 vindictive, in the implacable hate, swollen by lies and cruelties, that
 inflamed the heart of either army. And that day was spent by Maurice in
 the quarters of the Champ de Mars and the Invalides, firing and falling
 back slowly from street to street. He had not been able to find his
 battalion; he fought in the ranks with comrades who were strangers to him,
 accompanying them in their march to the left bank without taking heed
 whither they were going. About four o'clock they had a furious conflict
 behind a barricade that had been thrown across the Rue de l'Universite,
 where it comes out on the Esplanade, and it was not until twilight that
 they abandoned it on learning that Bruat's division, stealing up along the
 <i>quai</i>, had seized the Corps Legislatif. They had a narrow escape
 from capture, and it was with great difficulty that they managed to reach
 the Rue de Lille after a long circuit through the Rue Saint-Dominique and
 the Rue Bellechasse. At the close of that day the army of Versailles
 occupied a line which, beginning at the Vanves gate, led past the Corps
 Legislatif, the Palace of the Elysee, St. Augustine's Church, the Lazare
 station, and ended at the Asnieres gate.
 </p>
 <p>
 The next day, Tuesday, the 23d, was warm and bright, and a terrible day it
 was for Maurice. The few hundred federates with whom he was, and in whose
 ranks were men of many different battalions, were charged with the defense
 of the entire quartier, from the <i>quai</i> to the Rue Saint-Dominique.
 Most of them had bivouacked in the gardens of the great mansions that line
 the Rue de Lille; he had had an unbroken night's rest on a grass-plot at
 one side of the Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was his belief that soon
 as it was light enough the troops would move out from their shelter behind
 the Corps Legislatif and force them back upon the strong barricades in the
 Rue du Bac, but hour after hour passed and there was no sign of an attack.
 There was only some desultory firing at long range between parties posted
 at either end of the streets. The Versaillese, who were not desirous of
 attempting a direct attack on the front of the formidable fortress into
 which the insurgents had converted the terrace of the Tuileries, developed
 their plan of action with great circumspection; two strong columns were
 sent out to right and left that, skirting the ramparts, should first seize
 Montmartre and the Observatory and then, wheeling inward, swoop down on
 the central quarters, surrounding them and capturing all they contained,
 as a shoal of fish is captured in the meshes of a gigantic net. About two
 o'clock Maurice heard that the tricolor was floating over Montmartre: the
 great battery of the Moulin de la Galette had succumbed to the combined
 attack of three army corps, which hurled their battalions simultaneously
 on the northern and western faces of the butte through the Rues Lepic, des
 Saules and du Mont-Cenis; then the waves of the victorious troops had
 poured back on Paris, carrying the Place Saint-Georges, Notre-Dame de
 Lorette, the <i>mairie</i> in the Rue Drouot and the new Opera House,
 while on the left bank the turning movement, starting from the cemetery of
 Mont-Parnasse, had reached the Place d'Enfer and the Horse Market. These
 tidings of the rapid progress of the hostile army were received by the
 communards with mingled feelings of rage and terror amounting almost to
 stupefaction. What, Montmartre carried in two hours; Montmartre, the
 glorious, the impregnable citadel of the insurrection! Maurice saw that
 the ranks were thinning about him; trembling soldiers, fearing the fate
 that was in store for them should they be caught, were slinking furtively
 away to look for a place where they might wash the powder grime from hands
 and face and exchange their uniform for a blouse. There was a rumor that
 the enemy were making ready to attack the Croix-Rouge and take their
 position in flank. By this time the barricades in the Rues Martignac and
 Bellechasse had been carried, the red-legs were beginning to make their
 appearance at the end of the Rue de Lille, and soon all that remained was
 a little band of fanatics and men with the courage of their opinions,
 Maurice and some fifty more, who were resolved to sell their lives dearly,
 killing as many as they could of those Versaillese, who treated the
 federates like thieves and murderers, dragging away the prisoners they
 made and shooting them in the rear of the line of battle. Their bitter
 animosity had broadened and deepened since the days before; it was war to
 the knife between those rebels dying for an idea and that army, inflamed
 with reactionary passions and irritated that it was kept so long in the
 field.
 </p>
 <p>
 About five o'clock, as Maurice and his companions were finally falling
 back to seek the shelter of the barricades in the Rue du Bac, descending
 the Rue de Lille and pausing at every moment to fire another shot, he
 suddenly beheld volumes of dense black smoke pouring from an open window
 in the Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was the first fire kindled in
 Paris, and in the furious insanity that possessed him it gave him a fierce
 delight. The hour had struck; let the whole city go up in flame, let its
 people be cleansed by the fiery purification! But a sight that he saw
 presently filled him with surprise: a band of five or six men came
 hurrying out of the building, headed by a tall varlet in whom he
 recognized Chouteau, his former comrade in the squad of the 106th. He had
 seen him once before, after the 18th of March, wearing a gold-laced <i>kepi</i>;
 he seemed by his bedizened uniform to have risen in rank, was probably on
 the staff of some one of the many generals who were never seen where there
 was fighting going on. He remembered the account somebody had given him of
 that fellow Chouteau, of his quartering himself in the Palace of the
 Legion of Honor and living there, guzzling and swilling, in company with a
 mistress, wallowing with his boots on in the great luxurious beds,
 smashing the plate-glass mirrors with shots from his revolver, merely for
 the amusement there was in it. It was even asserted that the woman left
 the building every morning in one of the state carriages, under pretense
 of going to the Halles for her day's marketing, carrying off with her
 great bundles of linen, clocks, and even articles of furniture, the fruit
 of their thieveries. And Maurice, as he watched him running away with his
 men, carrying a bucket of petroleum on his arm, experienced a sickening
 sensation of doubt and felt his faith beginning to waver. How could the
 terrible work they were engaged in be good, when men like that were the
 workmen?
 </p>
 <p>
 Hours passed, and still he fought on, but with a bitter feeling of
 distress, with no other wish than that he might die. If he had erred, let
 him at least atone for his error with his blood! The barricade across the
 Rue de Lille, near its intersection with the Rue du Bac, was a formidable
 one, composed of bags and casks filled with earth and faced by a deep
 ditch. He and a scant dozen of other federates were its only defenders,
 resting in a semi-recumbent position on the ground, infallibly causing
 every soldier who exposed himself to bite the dust. He lay there, without
 even changing his position, until nightfall, using up his cartridges in
 silence, in the dogged sullenness of his despair. The dense clouds of
 smoke from the Palace of the Legion of Honor were billowing upward in
 denser masses, the flames undistinguishable as yet in the dying daylight,
 and he watched the fantastic, changing forms they took as the wind whirled
 them downward to the street. Another fire had broken out in an hotel not
 far away. And all at once a comrade came running up to tell him that the
 enemy, not daring to advance along the street, were making a way for
 themselves through the houses and gardens, breaking down the walls with
 picks. The end was close at hand; they might come out in the rear of the
 barricade at any moment. A shot having been fired from an upper window of
 a house on the corner, he saw Chouteau and his gang, with their petroleum
 and their lighted torch, rush with frantic speed to the buildings on
 either side and climb the stairs, and half an hour later, in the
 increasing darkness, the entire square was in flames, while he, still
 prone on the ground behind his shelter, availed himself of the vivid light
 to pick off any venturesome soldier who stepped from his protecting
 doorway into the narrow street.
 </p>
 <p>
 How long did Maurice keep on firing? He could not tell; he had lost all
 consciousness of time and place. It might be nine o'clock, or ten,
 perhaps. He continued to load and fire; his condition of hopelessness and
 gloom was pitiable; death seemed to him long in coming. The detestable
 work he was engaged in gave him now a sensation of nausea, as the fumes of
 the wine he has drunk rise and nauseate the drunkard. An intense heat
 began to beat on him from the houses that were burning on every side&mdash;an
 air that scorched and asphyxiated. The carrefour, with the barricades that
 closed it in, was become an intrenched camp, guarded by the roaring flames
 that rose on every side and sent down showers of sparks. Those were the
 orders, were they not? to fire the adjacent houses before they abandoned
 the barricades, arrest the progress of the troops by an impassable sea of
 flame, burn Paris in the face of the enemy advancing to take possession of
 it. And presently he became aware that the houses in the Rue du Bac were
 not the only ones that were devoted to destruction; looking behind him he
 beheld the whole sky suffused with a bright, ruddy glow; he heard an
 ominous roar in the distance, as if all Paris were bursting into
 conflagration. Chouteau was no longer to be seen; he had long since fled
 to save his skin from the bullets. His comrades, too, even those most
 zealous in the cause, had one by one stolen away, affrighted at the
 approaching prospect of being outflanked. At last he was left alone,
 stretched at length between two sand bags, his every faculty bent on
 defending the front of the barricade, when the soldiers, who had made
 their way through the gardens in the middle of the block, emerged from a
 house in the Rue du Bac and pounced on him from the rear.
 </p>
 <p>
 For two whole days, in the fevered excitement of the supreme conflict,
 Maurice had not once thought of Jean, nor had Jean, since he entered Paris
 with his regiment, which had been assigned to Bruat's division, for a
 single moment remembered Maurice. The day before his duties had kept him
 in the neighborhood of the Champ de Mars and the Esplanade of the
 Invalides, and on this day he had remained in the Place du Palais-Bourbon
 until nearly noon, when the troops were sent forward to clean out the
 barricades of the quartier, as far as the Rue des Saints-Peres. A feeling
 of deep exasperation against the rioters had gradually taken possession of
 him, usually so calm and self-contained, as it had of all his comrades,
 whose ardent wish it was to be allowed to go home and rest after so many
 months of fatigue. But of all the atrocities of the Commune that stirred
 his placid nature and made him forgetful even of his tenderest affections,
 there were none that angered him as did those conflagrations. What, burn
 houses, set fire to palaces, and simply because they had lost the battle!
 Only robbers and murderers were capable of such work as that. And he who
 but the day before had sorrowed over the summary executions of the
 insurgents was now like a madman, ready to rend and tear, yelling,
 shouting, his eyes starting from their sockets.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean burst like a hurricane into the Rue du Bac with the few men of his
 squad. At first he could distinguish no one; he thought the barricade had
 been abandoned. Then, looking more closely, he perceived a communard
 extended on the ground between two sand bags; he stirred, he brought his
 piece to the shoulder, was about to discharge it down the Rue du Bac. And
 impelled by blind fate, Jean rushed upon the man and thrust his bayonet
 through him, nailing him to the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice had not had time to turn. He gave a cry and raised his head. The
 blinding light of the burning buildings fell full on their faces.
 </p>
 <p>
 "O Jean, dear old boy, is it you?"
 </p>
 <p>
 To die, that was what he wished, what he had been longing for. But to die
 by his brother's hand, ah! the cup was too bitter; the thought of death no
 longer smiled on him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is it you, Jean, old friend?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean, sobered by the terrible shock, looked at him with wild eyes. They
 were alone; the other soldiers had gone in pursuit of the fugitives. About
 them the conflagrations roared and crackled and blazed up higher than
 before; great sheets of white flame poured from the windows, while from
 within came the crash of falling ceilings. And Jean cast himself on the
 ground at Maurice's side, sobbing, feeling him, trying to raise him to see
 if he might not yet be saved.
 </p>
 <p>
 "My boy, oh! my poor, poor boy!"

 VIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 When at about nine o'clock the train from Sedan, after innumerable delays
 along the way, rolled into the Saint-Denis station, the sky to the south
 was lit up by a fiery glow as if all Paris was burning. The light had
 increased with the growing darkness, and now it filled the horizon,
 climbing constantly higher up the heavens and tingeing with blood-red hues
 some clouds, that lay off to the eastward in the gloom which the contrast
 rendered more opaque than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
 The travelers alighted, Henriette among the first, alarmed by the glare
 they had beheld from the windows of the cars as they rushed onward across
 the darkling fields. The soldiers of a Prussian detachment, moreover, that
 had been sent to occupy the station, went through the train and compelled
 the passengers to leave it, while two of their number, stationed on the
 platform, shouted in guttural French:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Paris is burning. All out here! this train goes no further. Paris is
 burning, Paris is burning!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette experienced a terrible shock. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> was she too late,
 then? Receiving no reply from Maurice to her two last letters, the
 alarming news from Paris had filled her with such mortal terror that she
 determined to leave Remilly and come and try to find her brother in the
 great city. For months past her life at Uncle Fouchard's had been a
 melancholy one; the troops occupying the village and the surrounding
 country had become harsher and more exacting as the resistance of Paris
 was protracted, and now that peace was declared and the regiments were
 stringing along the roads, one by one, on their way home to Germany, the
 country and the cities through which they passed were taxed to their
 utmost to feed the hungry soldiers. The morning when she arose at daybreak
 to go and take the train at Sedan, looking out into the courtyard of the
 farmhouse she had seen a body of cavalry who had slept there all night,
 scattered promiscuously on the bare ground, wrapped in their long cloaks.
 They were so numerous that the earth was hidden by them. Then, at the
 shrill summons of a trumpet call, all had risen to their feet, silent,
 draped in the folds of those long mantles, and in such serried, close
 array that she involuntarily thought of the graves of a battlefield
 opening and giving up their dead at the call of the last trump. And here
 again at Saint-Denis she encountered the Prussians, and it was from
 Prussian lips that came that cry which caused her such distress:
 </p>
 <p>
 "All out here! this train goes no further. Paris is burning!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette, her little satchel in her hand, rushed distractedly up to the
 men in quest of information. There had been heavy fighting in Paris for
 the last two days, they told her, the railway had been destroyed, the
 Germans were watching the course of events. But she insisted on pursuing
 her journey at every risk, and catching sight upon the platform of the
 officer in command of the detachment detailed to guard the station, she
 hurried up to him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Sir, I am terribly distressed about my brother, and am trying to get to
 him. I entreat you, furnish me with the means to reach Paris." The light
 from a gas jet fell full on the captain's face she stopped in surprise.
 "What, Otto, is it you! Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, be good to me, since chance
 has once more brought us together!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was Otto Gunther, the cousin, as stiff and ceremonious as ever,
 tight-buttoned in his Guard's uniform, the picture of a narrow-minded
 martinet. At first he failed to recognize the little, thin,
 insignificant-looking woman, with the handsome light hair and the pale,
 gentle face; it was only by the brave, honest look that filled her eyes
 that he finally remembered her. His only answer was a slight shrug of the
 shoulders.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You know I have a brother in the army," Henriette eagerly went on. "He is
 in Paris; I fear he has allowed himself to become mixed up with this
 horrible conflict. O Otto, I beseech you, assist me to continue my
 journey."
 </p>
 <p>
 At last he condescended to speak. "But I can do nothing to help you;
 really I cannot. There have been no trains running since yesterday; I
 believe the rails have been torn up over by the ramparts somewhere. And I
 have neither a horse and carriage nor a man to guide you at my disposal."
 </p>
 <p>
 She looked him in the face with a low, stifled murmur of pain and sorrow
 to behold him thus obdurate. "Oh, you will do nothing to aid me. My God,
 to whom then can I turn!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was an unlikely story for one of those Prussians to tell, whose hosts
 were everywhere all-powerful, who had the city at their beck and call,
 could have requisitioned a hundred carriages and brought a thousand horses
 from their stables. And he denied her prayer with the haughty air of a
 victor who has made it a law to himself not to interfere with the concerns
 of the vanquished, lest thereby he might defile himself and tarnish the
 luster of his new-won laurels.
 </p>
 <p>
 "At all events," continued Henriette, "you know what is going on in the
 city; you won't refuse to tell me that much."
 </p>
 <p>
 He gave a smile, so faint as scarce to be perceptible. "Paris is burning.
 Look! come this way, you can see more clearly."
 </p>
 <p>
 Leaving the station, he preceded her along the track for a hundred steps
 or so until they came to an iron foot-bridge that spanned the road. When
 they had climbed the narrow stairs and reached the floor of the structure,
 resting their elbows on the railing, they beheld the broad level plain
 outstretched before them, at the foot of the slope of the embankment.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You see, Paris is burning."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was in the neighborhood of ten o'clock. The fierce red glare that lit
 the southern sky was ever mounting higher. The blood-red clouds had
 disappeared from where they had floated in the east; the zenith was like a
 great inverted bowl of inky blackness, across which ran the reflections of
 the distant flames. The horizon was one unbroken line of fire, but to the
 right they could distinguish spots where the conflagration was raging with
 greater fury, sending up great spires and pinnacles of flame, of the most
 vivid scarlet, to pierce the dense opacity above, amid billowing clouds of
 smoke. It was like the burning of some great forest, where the fire
 bridges intervening space, and leaps from tree to tree; one would have
 said the very earth must be calcined and reduced to ashes beneath the heat
 of Paris' gigantic funeral pyre.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Look," said Otto, "that eminence that you see profiled in black against
 the red background is Montmartre. There on the left, at Belleville and la
 Villette, there has not been a house burned yet; it must be they are
 selecting the districts of the wealthy for their work; and it spreads, it
 spreads. Look! there is another conflagration breaking out; watch the
 flames there to the right, how they seethe and rise and fall; observe the
 shifting tints of the vapors that rise from the blazing furnace. And
 others, and others still; the heavens are on fire!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He did not raise his voice or manifest any sign of feeling, and it froze
 Henriette's blood that a human being could stand by and witness such a
 spectacle unmoved. Ah, that those Prussians should be there to see that
 sight! She saw an insult in his studied calmness, in the faint smile that
 played upon his lips, as if he had long foreseen and been watching for
 that unparalleled disaster. So, Paris was burning then at last, Paris,
 upon whose monuments the German shells had scarce been able to inflict
 more than a scratch! and he was there to see it burn, and in the spectacle
 found compensation for all his grievances, the inordinate length to which
 the siege had been protracted, the bitter, freezing weather, the
 difficulties they had surmounted only to see them present themselves anew
 under some other shape, the toil and trouble they had had in mounting
 their heavy guns, while all the time Germany from behind was reproaching
 them with their dilatoriness. Nothing in all the glory of their victory,
 neither the ceded provinces nor the indemnity of five milliards, appealed
 to him so strongly as did that sight of Paris, in a fit of furious
 madness, immolating herself and going up in smoke and flame on that
 beautiful spring night.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, it was sure to come," he added in a lower voice. "Fine work, my
 masters!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It seemed to Henriette as if her heart would break in presence of that
 dire catastrophe. Her personal grief was lost to sight for some minutes,
 swallowed up in the great drama of a people's atonement that was being
 enacted before her eyes. The thought of the lives that would be sacrificed
 to the devouring flames, the sight of the great capital blazing on the
 horizon, emitting the infernal light of the cities that were accursed and
 smitten for their iniquity, elicited from her an involuntary cry of
 anguish. She clasped her hands, asking:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, merciful Father, of what have we been guilty that we should be
 punished thus?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Otto raised his arm in an oratorical attitude. He was on the point of
 speaking, with the stern, cold-blooded vehemence of the military bigot who
 has ever a quotation from Holy Writ at his tongue's end, but glancing at
 the young woman, the look he encountered from her candid, gentle eyes
 checked him. Besides, his gesture had spoken for him; it told his hatred
 for the nation, his conviction that he was in France to mete out justice,
 delegated by the God of Armies, to chastise a perverse and stiff-necked
 generation. Paris was burning off there on the horizon in expiation of its
 centuries of dissolute life, of its heaped-up measure of crime and lust.
 Once again the German race were to be the saviors of the world, were to
 purge Europe of the remnant of Latin corruption. He let his arm fall to
 his side and simply said:
 </p>
 <p>
 "It is the end of all. There is another quartier doomed, for see, a fresh
 fire has broken out there to the right. In that direction, that line of
 flame that creeps onward like a stream of lava&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Neither spoke for a long time; an awed silence rested on them. The great
 waves of flame continued to ascend, sending up streamers and ribbons of
 vivid light high into the heavens. Beneath the sea of fire was every
 moment extending its boundaries, a tossing, stormy, burning ocean, whence
 now arose dense clouds of smoke that collected over the city in a huge
 pall of a somber coppery hue, which was wafted slowly athwart the
 blackness of the night, streaking the vault of heaven with its accursed
 rain of ashes and of soot.
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette started as if awaking from an evil dream, and, the thought of
 her brother flowing in again upon her mind, once more became a supplicant.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can you do nothing for me? won't you assist me to get to Paris?"
 </p>
 <p>
 With his former air of unconcern Otto again raised his eyes to the
 horizon, smiling vaguely.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What would be the use? since to-morrow morning the city will be a pile of
 ruins!"
 </p>
 <p>
 And that was all; she left the bridge, without even bidding him good-by,
 flying, she knew not whither, with her little satchel, while he remained
 yet a long time at his post of observation, a motionless figure, rigid and
 erect, lost in the darkness of the night, feasting his eyes on the
 spectacle of that Babylon in flames.
 </p>
 <p>
 Almost the first person that Henriette encountered on emerging from the
 station was a stout lady who was chaffering with a hackman over his charge
 for driving her to the Rue Richelieu in Paris, and the young woman pleaded
 so touchingly, with tears in her eyes, that finally the lady consented to
 let her occupy a seat in the carriage. The driver, a little swarthy man,
 whipped up his horse and did not open his lips once during the ride, but
 the stout lady was extremely loquacious, telling how she had left the city
 the day but one before after tightly locking and bolting her shop, but had
 been so imprudent as to leave some valuable papers behind, hidden in a
 hole in the wall; hence her mind had been occupied by one engrossing
 thought for the two hours that the city had been burning, how she might
 return and snatch her property from the flames. The sleepy guards at the
 barrier allowed the carriage to pass without much difficulty, the worthy
 lady allaying their scruples with a fib, telling them she was bringing
 back her niece with her to Paris to assist in nursing her husband, who had
 been wounded by the Versaillese. It was not until they commenced to make
 their way along the paved streets that they encountered serious obstacles;
 they were obliged at every moment to turn out in order to avoid the
 barricades that were erected across the roadway, and when at last they
 reached the boulevard Poissoniere the driver declared he would go no
 further. The two women were therefore forced to continue their way on
 foot, through the Rue du Sentier, the Rue des Jeuneurs, and all the
 circumscribing region of the Bourse. As they approached the fortifications
 the blazing sky had made their way as bright before them as if it had been
 broad day; now they were surprised by the deserted and tranquil condition
 of the streets, where the only sound that disturbed the stillness was a
 dull, distant roar. In the vicinity of the Bourse, however, they were
 alarmed by the sound of musketry; they slipped along with great caution,
 hugging the walls. On reaching the Rue Richelieu and finding her shop had
 not been disturbed, the stout lady was so overjoyed that she insisted on
 seeing her traveling companion safely housed; they struck through the Rue
 du Hazard, the Rue Saint-Anne, and finally reached the Rue des Orties.
 Some federates, whose battalion was still holding the Rue Saint-Anne,
 attempted to prevent them from passing. It was four o'clock and already
 quite light when Henriette, exhausted by the fatigue of her long day and
 the stress of her emotions, reached the old house in the Rue des Orties
 and found the door standing open. Climbing the dark, narrow staircase, she
 turned to the left and discovered behind a door a ladder that led upward
 toward the roof.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, meantime, behind the barricade in the Rue du Bac, had succeeded
 in raising himself to his knees, and Jean's heart throbbed with a wild,
 tumultuous hope, for he believed he had pinned his friend to the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, my little one, are you alive still? is that great happiness in store
 for me, brute that I am? Wait a moment, let me see."
 </p>
 <p>
 He examined the wound with great tenderness by the light of the burning
 buildings. The bayonet had gone through the right arm near the shoulder,
 but a more serious part of the business was that it had afterward entered
 the body between two of the ribs and probably touched the lung. Still, the
 wounded man breathed without much apparent difficulty, but the right arm
 hung useless at his side.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Poor old boy, don't grieve! We shall have time to say good-by to each
 other, and it is better thus, you see; I am glad to have done with it all.
 You have done enough for me to make up for this, for I should have died
 long ago in some ditch, even as I am dying now, had it not been for you."
 </p>
 <p>
 But Jean, hearing him speak thus, again gave way to an outburst of violent
 grief.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hush, hush! Twice you saved me from the clutches of the Prussians. We
 were quits; it was my turn to devote my life, and instead of that I have
 slain you. Ah, <i>tonnerre de Dieu!</i> I must have been drunk not to
 recognize you; yes, drunk as a hog from glutting myself with blood."
 </p>
 <p>
 Tears streamed from his eyes at the recollection of their last parting,
 down there, at Remilly, when they embraced, asking themselves if they
 should ever meet again, and how, under what circumstances of sorrow or of
 gladness. It was nothing, then, that they had passed toilsome days and
 sleepless nights together, with death staring them in the face? It was to
 bring them to this abominable thing, to this senseless, atrocious
 fratricide, that their hearts had been fused in the crucible of those
 weeks of suffering endured in common? No, no, it could not be; he turned
 in horror from the thought.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Let's see what I can do, little one; I must save you."
 </p>
 <p>
 The first thing to be done was to remove him to a place of safety, for the
 troops dispatched the wounded Communists wherever they found them. They
 were alone, fortunately; there was not a minute to lose. He first ripped
 the sleeve from wrist to shoulder with his knife, then took off the
 uniform coat. Some blood flowed; he made haste to bandage the arm securely
 with strips that he tore from the lining of the garment for the purpose.
 After that he staunched as well as he could the wound in the side and
 fastened the injured arm over it, He luckily had a bit of cord in his
 pocket, which he knotted tightly around the primitive dressing, thus
 assuring the immobility of the injured parts and preventing hemorrhage.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Can you walk?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, I think so."
 </p>
 <p>
 But he did not dare to take him through the streets thus, in his shirt
 sleeves. Remembering to have seen a dead soldier lying in an adjacent
 street, he hurried off and presently came back with a capote and a <i>kepi</i>.
 He threw the greatcoat over his friend's shoulders and assisted him to
 slip his uninjured arm into the left sleeve. Then, when he had put the <i>kepi</i>
 on his head:
 </p>
 <p>
 "There, now you are one of us&mdash;where are we to go?"
 </p>
 <p>
 That was the question. His reviving hope and courage were suddenly damped
 by a horrible uncertainty. Where were they to look for a shelter that gave
 promise of security? the troops were searching the houses, were shooting
 every Communist they took with arms in his hands. And in addition to that,
 neither of them knew a soul in that portion of the city to whom they might
 apply for succor and refuge; not a place where they might hide their
 heads.
 </p>
 <p>
 "The best thing to do would be to go home where I live," said Maurice.
 "The house is out of the way; no one will ever think of visiting it. But
 it is in the Rue des Orties, on the other side of the river."
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean gave vent to a muttered oath in his irresolution and despair.
 </p>
 <p>
 "<i>Nom de Dieu!</i> What are we to do?"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was useless to think of attempting to pass the Pont Royal, which could
 not have been more brilliantly illuminated if the noonday sun had been
 shining on it. At every moment shots were heard coming from either bank of
 the river. Besides that, the blazing Tuileries lay directly in their path,
 and the Louvre, guarded and barricaded, would be an insurmountable
 obstacle.
 </p>
 <p>
 "That ends it, then; there's no way open," said Jean, who had spent six
 months in Paris on his return from the Italian campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
 An idea suddenly flashed across his brain. There had formerly been a place
 a little below the Pont Royal where small boats were kept for hire; if the
 boats were there still they would make the venture. The route was a long
 and dangerous one, but they had no choice, and, further, they must act
 with decision.
 </p>
 <p>
 "See here, little one, we're going to clear out from here; the locality
 isn't healthy. I'll manufacture an excuse for my lieutenant; I'll tell him
 the communards took me prisoner and I got away."
 </p>
 <p>
 Taking his unhurt arm he sustained him for the short distance they had to
 traverse along the Rue du Bac, where the tall houses on either hand were
 now ablaze from cellar to garret, like huge torches. The burning cinders
 fell on them in showers, the heat was so intense that the hair on their
 head and face was singed, and when they came out on the <i>quai</i> they
 stood for a moment dazed and blinded by the terrific light of the
 conflagrations, rearing their tall crests heavenward, on either side the
 Seine.
 </p>
 <p>
 "One wouldn't need a candle to go to bed by here," grumbled Jean, with
 whose plans the illumination promised to interfere. And it was only when
 he had helped Maurice down the steps to the left and a little way down
 stream from the bridge that he felt somewhat easy in mind. There was a
 clump of tall trees standing on the bank of the stream, whose shadow gave
 them a measure of security. For near a quarter of an hour the dark forms
 moving to and fro on the opposite <i>quai</i> kept them in a fever of
 apprehension. There was firing, a scream was heard, succeeded by a loud
 splash, and the bosom of the river was disturbed. The bridge was evidently
 guarded.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Suppose we pass the night in that shed?" suggested Maurice, pointing to
 the wooden structure that served the boatman as an office.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, and get pinched to-morrow morning!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean was still harboring his idea. He had found quite a flotilla of small
 boats there, but they were all securely fastened with chains; how was he
 to get one loose and secure a pair of oars? At last he discovered two oars
 that had been thrown aside as useless; he succeeded in forcing a padlock,
 and when he had stowed Maurice away in the bow, shoved off and allowed the
 boat to drift with the current, cautiously hugging the shore and keeping
 in the shadow of the bathing-houses. Neither of them spoke a word,
 horror-stricken as they were by the baleful spectacle that presented
 itself to their vision. As they floated down the stream and their horizon
 widened the enormity of the terrible sight increased, and when they
 reached the bridge of Solferino a single glance sufficed to embrace both
 the blazing <i>quais</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 On their left the palace of the Tuileries was burning. It was not yet dark
 when the Communists had fired the two extremities of the structure, the
 Pavilion de Flore and the Pavilion de Marsan, and with rapid strides the
 flames had gained the Pavilion de l'Horloge in the central portion,
 beneath which, in the Salle des Marechaux, a mine had been prepared by
 stacking up casks of powder. At that moment the intervening buildings were
 belching from their shattered windows dense volumes of reddish smoke,
 streaked with long ribbons of blue flame. The roofs, yawning as does the
 earth in regions where volcanic agencies prevail, were seamed with great
 cracks through which the raging sea of fire beneath was visible. But the
 grandest, saddest spectacle of all was that afforded by the Pavilion de
 Flore, to which the torch had been earliest applied and which was ablaze
 from its foundation to its lofty summit, burning with a deep, fierce roar
 that could be heard far away. The petroleum with which the floors and
 hangings had been soaked gave the flames an intensity such that the
 ironwork of the balconies was seen to twist and writhe in the convolutions
 of a serpent, and the tall monumental chimneys, with their elaborate
 carvings, glowed with the fervor of live coals.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then, still on their left, were, first, the Chancellerie of the Legion of
 Honor, which was fired at five o'clock in the afternoon and had been
 burning nearly seven hours, and next, the Palace of the Council of State,
 a huge rectangular structure of stone, which was spouting torrents of fire
 from every orifice in each of its two colonnaded stories. The four
 structures surrounding the great central court had all caught at the same
 moment, and the petroleum, which here also had been distributed by the
 barrelful, had poured down the four grand staircases at the four corners
 of the building in rivers of hellfire. On the facade that faced the river
 the black line of the mansard was profiled distinctly against the ruddy
 sky, amid the red tongues that rose to lick its base, while colonnades,
 entablatures, friezes, carvings, all stood out with startling vividness in
 the blinding, shimmering glow. So great was the energy of the fire, so
 terrible its propulsive force, that the colossal structure was in some
 sort raised bodily from the earth, trembling and rumbling on its
 foundations, preserving intact only its four massive walls, in the fierce
 eruption that hurled its heavy zinc roof high in air. Then, close at one
 side were the d'Orsay barracks, which burned with a flame that seemed to
 pierce the heavens, so purely white and so unwavering that it was like a
 tower of light. And finally, back from the river, were still other fires,
 the seven houses in the Rue du Bac, the twenty-two houses in the Rue de
 Lille, helping to tinge the sky a deeper crimson, profiling their flames
 on other flames, in a blood-red ocean that seemed to have no end.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean murmured in awed tone:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Did ever mortal man look on the like of this! the very river is on fire."
 </p>
 <p>
 Their boat seemed to be sailing on the bosom of an incandescent stream. As
 the dancing lights of the mighty conflagrations were caught by the ripples
 of the current the Seine seemed to be pouring down torrents of living
 coals; flashes of intensest crimson played fitfully across its surface,
 the blazing brands fell in showers into the water and were extinguished
 with a hiss. And ever they floated downward with the tide on the bosom of
 that blood-red stream, between the blazing palaces on either hand, like
 wayfarers in some accursed city, doomed to destruction and burning on the
 banks of a river of molten lava.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah!" exclaimed Maurice, with a fresh access of madness at the sight of
 the havoc he had longed for, "let it burn, let it all go up in smoke!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Jean silenced him with a terrified gesture, as if he feared such
 blasphemy might bring them evil. Where could a young man whom he loved so
 fondly, so delicately nurtured, so well informed, have picked up such
 ideas? And he applied himself more vigorously to the oars, for they had
 now passed the bridge of Solferino and were come out into a wide open
 space of water. The light was so intense that the river was illuminated as
 by the noonday sun when it stands vertically above men's heads and casts
 no shadow. The most minute objects, such as the eddies in the stream, the
 stones piled on the banks, the small trees along the <i>quais</i>, stood
 out before their vision with wonderful distinctness. The bridges, too,
 were particularly noticeable in their dazzling whiteness, and so clearly
 defined that they could have counted every stone; they had the appearance
 of narrow gangways thrown across the fiery stream to connect one
 conflagration with the other. Amid the roar of the flames and the general
 clamor a loud crash occasionally announced the fall of some stately
 edifice. Dense clouds of soot hung in the air and settled everywhere, the
 wind brought odors of pestilence on its wings. And another horror was that
 Paris, those more distant quarters of the city that lay back from the
 banks of the Seine, had ceased to exist for them. To right and left of the
 conflagration that raged with such fierce resplendency was an unfathomable
 gulf of blackness; all that presented itself to their strained gaze was a
 vast waste of shadow, an empty void, as if the devouring element had
 reached the utmost limits of the city and all Paris were swallowed up in
 everlasting night. And the heavens, too, were dead and lifeless; the
 flames rose so high that they extinguished the stars.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who was becoming delirious, laughed wildly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "High carnival at the Consoil d'Etat and at the Tuileries to-night! They
 have illuminated the facades, women are dancing beneath the sparkling
 chandeliers. Ah, dance, dance and be merry, in your smoking petticoats,
 with your chignons ablaze&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 And he drew a picture of the feasts of Sodom and Gomorrah, the music, the
 lights, the flowers, the unmentionable orgies of lust and drunkenness,
 until the candles on the walls blushed at the shamelessness of the display
 and fired the palaces that sheltered such depravity. Suddenly there was a
 terrific explosion. The fire, approaching from either extremity of the
 Tuileries, had reached the Salle des Marechaux, the casks of powder
 caught, the Pavilion de l'Horloge was blown into the air with the violence
 of a powder mill. A column of flame mounted high in the heavens, and
 spreading, expanded in a great fiery plume on the inky blackness of the
 sky, the crowning display of the horrid <i>fete</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Bravo!" exclaimed Maurice, as at the end of the play, when the lights are
 extinguished and darkness settles on the stage.
 </p>
 <p>
 Again Jean, in stammering, disconnected sentences, besought him to be
 quiet. No, no, it was not right to wish evils to anyone! And if they
 invoked destruction, would not they themselves perish in the general ruin?
 His sole desire was to find a landing place so that he might no longer
 have that horrid spectacle before his eyes. He considered it best not to
 attempt to land at the Pont de la Concorde, but, rounding the elbow of the
 Seine, pulled on until they reached the Quai de la Conference, and even at
 that critical moment, instead of shoving the skiff out into the stream to
 take its chances, he wasted some precious moments in securing it, in his
 instinctive respect for the property of others. While doing this he had
 seated Maurice comfortably on the bank; his plan was to reach the Rue des
 Orties through the Place de la Concorde and the Rue Saint-Honore. Before
 proceeding further he climbed alone to the top of the steps that ascended
 from the <i>quai</i> to explore the ground, and on witnessing the
 obstacles they would have to surmount his courage was almost daunted.
 There lay the impregnable fortress of the Commune, the terrace of the
 Tuileries bristling with cannon, the Rues Royale, Florentin, and Rivoli
 obstructed by lofty and massive barricades; and this state of affairs
 explained the tactics of the army of Versailles, whose line that night
 described an immense arc, the center and apex resting on the Place de la
 Concorde, one of the two extremities being at the freight depot of the
 Northern Railway on the right bank, the other on the left bank, at one of
 the bastions of the ramparts, near the gate of Arcueil. But as the night
 advanced the Communards had evacuated the Tuileries and the barricades and
 the regular troops had taken possession of the quartier in the midst of
 further conflagrations; twelve houses at the junction of the Rue
 Saint-Honore and the Rue Royale had been burning since nine o'clock in the
 evening.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean descended the steps and reached the river-bank again he found
 Maurice in a semi-comatose condition, the effects of the reaction after
 his hysterical outbreak.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It will be no easy job. I hope you are going to be able to walk,
 youngster?"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes; don't be alarmed. I'll get there somehow, alive or dead."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was not without great difficulty that he climbed the stone steps, and
 when he reached the level ground of the <i>quai</i> at the summit he
 walked very slowly, supported by his companion's arm, with the shuffling
 gait of a somnambulist. The day had not dawned yet, but the reflected
 light from the burning buildings cast a lurid illumination on the wide
 Place. They made their way in silence across its deep solitude, sick at
 heart to behold the mournful scene of devastation it presented. At either
 extremity, beyond the bridge and at the further end of the Rue Royale,
 they could faintly discern the shadowy outlines of the Palais Bourbon and
 the Church of the Madeleine, torn by shot and shell. The terrace of the
 Tuileries had been breached by the fire of the siege guns and was
 partially in ruins. On the Place itself the bronze railings and ornaments
 of the fountains had been chipped and defaced by the balls; the colossal
 statue of Lille lay on the ground shattered by a projectile, while near at
 hand the statue of Strasbourg, shrouded in heavy veils of crape, seemed to
 be mourning the ruin that surrounded it on every side. And near the
 Obelisk, which had escaped unscathed, a gas-pipe in its trench had been
 broken by the pick of a careless workman, and the escaping gas, fired by
 some accident, was flaring up in a great undulating jet, with a roaring,
 hissing sound.
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean gave a wide berth to the barricade erected across the Rue Royale
 between the Ministry of Marine and the Garde-Meuble, both of which the
 fire had spared; he could hear the voices of the soldiers behind the sand
 bags and casks of earth with which it was constructed. Its front was
 protected by a ditch, filled with stagnant, greenish water, in which was
 floating the dead body of a federate, and through one of its embrasures
 they caught a glimpse of the houses in the carrefour Saint-Honore, which
 were burning still in spite of the engines that had come in from the
 suburbs, of which they heard the roar and clatter. To right and left the
 trees and the kiosks of the newspaper venders were riddled by the storm of
 bullets to which they had been subjected. Loud cries of horror arose; the
 firemen, in exploring the cellar of one of the burning houses, had come
 across the charred bodies of seven of its inmates.
 </p>
 <p>
 Although the barricade that closed the entrance to the Rue Saint-Florentin
 and the Rue de Rivoli by its skilled construction and great height
 appeared even more formidable than the other, Jean's instinct told him
 they would have less difficulty in getting by it. It was completely
 evacuated, indeed, and the Versailles troops had not yet entered it. The
 abandoned guns were resting in the embrasures in peaceful slumber, the
 only living thing behind that invincible rampart was a stray dog, that
 scuttled away in haste. But as Jean was making what speed he could along
 the Rue Saint-Florentin, sustaining Maurice, whose strength was giving
 out, that which he had been in fear of came to pass; they fell directly
 into the arms of an entire company of the 88th of the line, which had
 turned the barricade.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Captain," he explained, "this is a comrade of mine, who has just been
 wounded by those bandits. I am taking him to the hospital."
 </p>
 <p>
 It was then that the capote which he had thrown over Maurice's shoulders
 stood them in good stead, and Jean's heart was beating like a trip-hammer
 as at last they turned into the Rue Saint-Honore. Day was just breaking,
 and the sound of shots reached their ears from the cross-streets, for
 fighting was going on still throughout the quartier. It was little short
 of a miracle that they finally reached the Rue des Frondeurs without
 sustaining any more disagreeable adventure. Their progress was extremely
 slow; the last four or five hundred yards appeared interminable. In the
 Rue des Frondeurs they struck up against a communist picket, but the
 federates, thinking a whole regiment was at hand, took to their heels. And
 now they had but a short bit of the Rue d'Argenteuil to traverse and they
 would be safe in the Rue des Orties.
 </p>
 <p>
 For four long hours that seemed like an eternity Jean's longing desire had
 been bent on that Rue des Orties with feverish impatience, and now they
 were there it appeared like a haven of safety. It was dark, silent, and
 deserted, as if there were no battle raging within a hundred leagues of
 it. The house, an old, narrow house without a concierge, was still as the
 grave.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I have the keys in my pocket," murmured Maurice. "The big one opens the
 street door, the little one is the key of my room, way at the top of the
 house."
 </p>
 <p>
 He succumbed and fainted dead away in Jean's arms, whose alarm and
 distress were extreme. They made him forget to close the outer door, and
 he had to grope his way up that strange, dark staircase, bearing his
 lifeless burden and observing the greatest caution not to stumble or make
 any noise that might arouse the sleeping inmates of the rooms. When he had
 gained the top he had to deposit the wounded man on the floor while he
 searched for the chamber door by striking matches, of which he fortunately
 had a supply in his pocket, and only when he had found and opened it did
 he return and raise him in his arms again. Entering, he laid him on the
 little iron bed that faced the window, which he threw open to its full
 extent in his great need of air and light. It was broad day; he dropped on
 his knees beside the bed, sobbing as if his heart would break, suddenly
 abandoned by all his strength as the fearful thought again smote him that
 he had slain his friend.
 </p>
 <p>
 Minutes passed; he was hardly surprised when, raising his eyes, he saw
 Henriette standing by the bed. It was perfectly natural: her brother was
 dying, she had come. He had not even seen her enter the room; for all he
 knew she might have been standing there for hours. He sank into a chair
 and watched her with stupid eyes as she hovered about the bed, her heart
 wrung with mortal anguish at sight of her brother lying there senseless,
 in his blood-stained garments. Then his memory began to act again; he
 asked:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Tell me, did you close the street door?"
 </p>
 <p>
 She answered with an affirmative motion of the head, and as she came
 toward him, extending her two hands in her great need of sympathy and
 support, he added:
 </p>
 <p>
 "You know it was I who killed him."
 </p>
 <p>
 She did not understand; she did not believe him. He felt no flutter in the
 two little hands that rested confidingly in his own.
 </p>
 <p>
 "It was I who killed him&mdash;yes, 'twas over yonder, behind a barricade,
 I did it. He was fighting on one side, I on the other&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 There began to be a fluttering of the little hands.
 </p>
 <p>
 "We were like drunken men, none of us knew what he as about&mdash;it was I
 who killed him."
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Henriette, shivering, pale as death, withdrew her hands, fixing on
 him a gaze that was full of horror. Father of Mercy, was the end of all
 things come! was her crushed and bleeding heart to know no peace for ever
 more! Ah, that Jean, of whom she had been thinking that very day, happy in
 the unshaped hope that perhaps she might see him once again! And it was he
 who had done that abominable thing; and yet he had saved Maurice, for was
 it not he who had brought him home through so many perils? She could not
 yield her hands to him now without a revolt of all her being, but she
 uttered a cry into which she threw the last hope of her tortured and
 distracted heart.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh! I will save him; I <i>must</i> save him, now!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She had acquired considerable experience in surgery during the long time
 she had been in attendance on the hospital at Remilly, and now she
 proceeded without delay to examine her brother's hurt, who remained
 unconscious while she was undressing him. But when she undid the rude
 bandage of Jean's invention, he stirred feebly and uttered a faint cry of
 pain, opening wide his eyes that were bright with fever. He recognized her
 at once and smiled.
 </p>
 <p>
 "You here! Ah, how glad I am to see you once more before I die!"
 </p>
 <p>
 She silenced him, speaking in a tone of cheerful confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hush, don't talk of dying; I won't allow it! I mean that you shall live!
 There, be quiet, and let me see what is to be done."
 </p>
 <p>
 However, when Henriette had examined the injured arm and the wound in the
 side, her face became clouded and a troubled look rose to her eyes. She
 installed herself as mistress in the room, searching until she found a
 little oil, tearing up old shirts for bandages, while Jean descended to
 the lower regions for a pitcher of water. He did not open his mouth, but
 looked on in silence as she washed and deftly dressed the wounds,
 incapable of aiding her, seemingly deprived of all power of action by her
 presence there. When she had concluded her task, however, noticing her
 alarmed expression, he proposed to her that he should go and secure a
 doctor, but she was in possession of all her clear intelligence. No, no;
 she would not have a chance-met doctor, of whom they knew nothing, who,
 perhaps, would betray her brother to the authorities. They must have a man
 they could depend on; they could afford to wait a few hours. Finally, when
 Jean said he must go and report for duty with his company, it was agreed
 that he should return as soon as he could get away, and try to bring a
 surgeon with him.
 </p>
 <p>
 He delayed his departure, seemingly unable to make up his mind to leave
 that room, whose atmosphere was pervaded by the evil he had
 unintentionally done. The window, which had been closed for a moment, had
 been opened again, and from it the wounded man, lying on his bed, his head
 propped up by pillows, was looking out over the city, while the others,
 also, in the oppressive silence that had settled on the chamber, were
 gazing out into vacancy.
 </p>
 <p>
 From that elevated point of the Butte des Moulins a good half of Paris lay
 stretched beneath their eyes in a vast panorama: first the central
 districts, from the Faubourg Saint-Honore to the Bastille, then the Seine
 in its entire course through the city, with the thickly-built,
 densely-populated regions of the left bank, an ocean of roofs, treetops,
 steeples, domes, and towers. The light was growing stronger, the
 abominable night, than which there have been few more terrible in history,
 was ended; but beneath the rosy sky, in the pure, clear light of the
 rising sun, the fires were blazing still. Before them lay the burning
 Tuileries, the d'Orsay barracks, the Palaces of the Council of State and
 the Legion of Honor, the flames from which were paled by the superior
 refulgence of the day-star. Even beyond the houses in the Rue de Lille and
 the Rue du Bac there must have been other structures burning, for clouds
 of smoke were visible rising from the carrefour of la Croix-Rouge, and,
 more distant still, from the Rue Vavin and the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs.
 Nearer at hand and to their right the fires in the Rue Saint-Honore were
 dying out, while to the left, at the Palais-Royal and the new Louvre, to
 which the torch had not been applied until near morning, the work of the
 incendiaries was apparently a failure. But what they were unable to
 account for at first was the dense volume of black smoke which, impelled
 by the west wind, came driving past their window. Fire had been set to the
 Ministry of Finance at three o'clock in the morning and ever since that
 time it had been smoldering, emitting no blaze, among the stacks and piles
 of documents that were contained in the low-ceiled, fire-proof vaults and
 chambers. And if the terrific impressions of the night were not there to
 preside at the awakening of the great city&mdash;the fear of total
 destruction, the Seine pouring its fiery waves past their doors, Paris
 kindling into flame from end to end&mdash;a feeling of gloom and despair,
 hung heavy over the quartiers that had been spared, with that dense,
 on-pouring smoke, whose dusky cloud was ever spreading. Presently the sun,
 which had risen bright and clear, was hid by it, and the golden sky was
 filled with the great funeral pall.
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, who appeared to be delirious again, made a slow, sweeping gesture
 that embraced the entire horizon, murmuring:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Is it all burning? Ah, how long it takes!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Tears rose to Henriette's eyes, as if her burden of misery was made
 heavier for her by the share her brother had had in those deeds of horror.
 And Jean, who dared neither take her hand nor embrace his friend, left the
 room with the air of one crazed by grief.
 </p>
 <p>
 "I will return soon. <i>Au revoir</i>!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was dark, however, nearly eight o'clock, before he was able to redeem
 his promise. Notwithstanding his great distress he was happy; his regiment
 had been transferred from the first to the second line and assigned the
 task of protecting the quartier, so that, bivouacking with his company in
 the Place du Carrousel, he hoped to get a chance to run in each evening to
 see how the wounded man was getting on. And he did not return alone; as
 luck would have it he had fallen in with the former surgeon of the 106th
 and had brought him along with him, having been unable to find another
 doctor, consoling himself with the reflection that the terrible, big man
 with the lion's mane was not such a bad sort of fellow after all.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Bouroche, who knew nothing of the patient he was summoned with such
 insistence to attend and grumbled at having to climb so many stairs,
 learned that it was a Communist he had on his hands he commenced to storm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "God's thunder, what do you take me for? Do you suppose I'm going to waste
 my time on those thieving, murdering, house-burning scoundrels? As for
 this particular bandit, his case is clear, and I'll take it upon me to see
 he is cured; yes, with a bullet in his head!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But his anger subsided suddenly at sight of Henriette's pale face and her
 golden hair streaming in disorder over her black dress.
 </p>
 <p>
 "He is my brother, doctor, and he was with you at Sedan."
 </p>
 <p>
 He made no reply, but uncovered the injuries and examined them in silence;
 then, taking some phials from his pocket, he made a fresh dressing,
 explaining to the young woman how it was done. When he had finished he
 turned suddenly to the patient and asked in his loud, rough voice:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Why did you take sides with those ruffians? What could cause you to be
 guilty of such an abomination?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice, with a feverish luster in his eyes, had been watching him since
 he entered the room, but no word had escaped his lips. He answered in a
 voice that was almost fierce, so eager was it:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Because there is too much suffering in the world, too much wickedness,
 too much infamy!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche's shrug of the shoulders seemed to indicate that he thought a
 young man was likely to make his mark who carried such ideas about in his
 head. He appeared to be about to say something further, but changed his
 mind and bowed himself out, simply adding:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I will come in again."
 </p>
 <p>
 To Henriette, on the landing, he said he would not venture to make any
 promises. The injury to the lung was serious; hemorrhage might set in and
 carry off the patient without a moment's warning. And when she re-entered
 the room she forced a smile to her lips, notwithstanding the sharp stab
 with which the doctor's words had pierced her heart, for had she not
 promised herself to save him? and could she permit him to be snatched from
 them now that they three were again united, with a prospect of a lifetime
 of affection and happiness before them? She had not left the room since
 morning, an old woman who lived on the landing having kindly offered to
 act as her messenger for the purchase of such things as she required. And
 she returned and resumed her place upon a chair at her brother's bedside.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice, in his febrile excitation, questioned Jean, insisting on
 knowing what had happened since the morning. The latter did not tell him
 everything, maintaining a discreet silence upon the furious rage which
 Paris, now it was delivered from its tyrants, was manifesting toward the
 dying Commune. It was now Wednesday. For two interminable days succeeding
 the Sunday evening when the conflict first broke out the citizens had
 lived in their cellars, quaking with fear, and when they ventured out at
 last on Wednesday morning, the spectacle of bloodshed and devastation that
 met their eyes on every side, and more particularly the frightful ruin
 entailed by the conflagrations, aroused in their breasts feelings the
 bitterest and most vindictive. It was felt in every quarter that the
 punishment must be worthy of the crime. The houses in the suspected
 quarters were subjected to a rigorous search and men and women who were at
 all tainted with suspicion were led away in droves and shot without
 formality. At six o'clock of the evening of that day the army of the
 Versaillese was master of the half of Paris, following the line of the
 principal avenues from the park of Montsouris to the station of the
 Northern Railway, and the remainder of the braver members of the Commune,
 a mere handful, some twenty or so, had taken refuge in the <i>mairie</i>
 of the eleventh arrondissement, in the Boulevard Voltaire.
 </p>
 <p>
 They were silent when he concluded his narration, and Maurice, his glance
 vaguely wandering over the city through the open window that let in the
 soft, warm air of evening, murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Well, the work goes on; Paris continues to burn!"
 </p>
 <p>
 It was true: the flames were becoming visible again in the increasing
 darkness and the heavens were reddened once more with the ill-omened
 light. That afternoon the powder magazine at the Luxembourg had exploded
 with a frightful detonation, which gave rise to a report that the Pantheon
 had collapsed and sunk into the catacombs. All that day, moreover, the
 conflagrations of the night pursued their course unchecked; the Palace of
 the Council of State and the Tuileries were burning still, the Ministry of
 Finance continued to belch forth its billowing clouds of smoke. A dozen
 times Henriette was obliged to close the window against the shower of
 blackened, burning paper that the hot breath of the fire whirled upward
 into the sky, whence it descended to earth again in a fine rain of
 fragments; the streets of Paris were covered with them, and some were
 found in the fields of Normandy, thirty leagues away. And now it was not
 the western and southern districts alone which seemed devoted to
 destruction, the houses in the Rue Royale and those of the Croix-Rouge and
 the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs: the entire eastern portion of the city
 appeared to be in flames, the Hotel de Ville glowed on the horizon like a
 mighty furnace. And in that direction also, blazing like gigantic
 beacon-fires upon the mountain tops, were the Theatre-Lyrique, the <i>mairie</i>
 of the fourth arrondissement, and more than thirty houses in the adjacent
 streets, to say nothing of the theater of the Porte-Saint-Martin, further
 to the north, which illuminated the darkness of its locality as a stack of
 grain lights up the deserted, dusky fields at night. There is no doubt
 that in many cases the incendiaries were actuated by motives of personal
 revenge; perhaps, too, there were criminal records which the parties
 implicated had an object in destroying. It was no longer a question of
 self-defense with the Commune, of checking the advance of the victorious
 troops by fire; a delirium of destruction raged among its adherents: the
 Palace of Justice, the Hotel-Dieu and the cathedral of Notre-Dame escaped
 by the merest chance. They would destroy solely for the sake of
 destroying, would bury the effete, rotten humanity beneath the ruins of a
 world, in the hope that from the ashes might spring a new and innocent
 race that should realize the primitive legends of an earthly paradise. And
 all that night again did the sea of flame roll its waves over Paris.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah; war, war, what a hateful thing it is!" said Henriette to herself,
 looking out on the sore-smitten city.
 </p>
 <p>
 Was it not indeed the last act, the inevitable conclusion of the tragedy,
 the blood-madness for which the lost fields of Sedan and Metz were
 responsible, the epidemic of destruction born from the siege of Paris, the
 supreme struggle of a nation in peril of dissolution, in the midst of
 slaughter and universal ruin?
 </p>
 <p>
 But Maurice, without taking his eyes from the fires that were raging in
 the distance, feebly, and with an effort, murmured:
 </p>
 <p>
 "No, no; do not be unjust toward war. It is good; it has its appointed
 work to do&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 There were mingled hatred and remorse in the cry with which Jean
 interrupted him.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Good God! When I see you lying there, and know it is through my fault&mdash;Do
 not say a word in defense of it; it is an accursed thing, is war!"
 </p>
 <p>
 The wounded man smiled faintly.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Oh, as for me, what matters it? There is many another in my condition. It
 may be that this blood-letting was necessary for us. War is life, which
 cannot exist without its sister, death."
 </p>
 <p>
 And Maurice closed his eyes, exhausted by the effort it had cost him to
 utter those few words. Henriette signaled Jean not to continue the
 discussion. It angered her; all her being rose in protest against such
 suffering and waste of human life, notwithstanding the calm bravery of her
 frail woman's nature, with her clear, limpid eyes, in which lived again
 all the heroic spirit of the grandfather, the veteran of the Napoleonic
 wars.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two days more, Thursday and Friday, passed, like their predecessors, amid
 scenes of slaughter and conflagration. The thunder of the artillery was
 incessant; the batteries of the army of Versailles on the heights of
 Montmartre roared against those that the federates had established at
 Belleville and Pare-Lachaise without a moment's respite, while the latter
 maintained a desultory fire on Paris. Shells had fallen in the Rue
 Richelieu and the Place Vendome. At evening on the 25th the entire left
 bank was in possession of the regular troops, but on the right bank the
 barricades in the Place Chateau d'Eau and the Place de la Bastille
 continued to hold out; they were veritable fortresses, from which
 proceeded an uninterrupted and most destructive fire. At twilight, while
 the last remaining members of the Commune were stealing off to make
 provision for their safety, Delescluze took his cane and walked leisurely
 away to the barricade that was thrown across the Boulevard Voltaire, where
 he died a hero's death. At daybreak on the following morning, the 26th,
 the Chateau d'Eau and Bastille positions were carried, and the Communists,
 now reduced to a handful of brave men who were resolved to sell their
 lives dearly, had only la Villette, Belleville, and Charonne left to them,
 And for two more days they remained and fought there with the fury of
 despair.
 </p>
 <p>
 On Friday evening, as Jean was on his way from the Place du Carrousel to
 the Rue des Orties, he witnessed a summary execution in the Rue Richelieu
 that filled him with horror. For the last forty-eight hours two
 courts-martial had been sitting, one at the Luxembourg, the other at the
 Theatre du Chatelet; the prisoners convicted by the former were taken into
 the garden and shot, while those found guilty by the latter were dragged
 away to the Lobau barracks, where a platoon of soldiers that was kept
 there in constant attendance for the purpose mowed them down, almost at
 point-blank range. The scenes of slaughter there were most horrible: there
 were men and women who had been condemned to death on the flimsiest
 evidence: because they had a stain of powder on their hands, because their
 feet were shod with army shoes; there were innocent persons, the victims
 of private malice, who had been wrongfully denounced, shrieking forth
 their entreaties and explanations and finding no one to lend an ear to
 them; and all were driven pell-mell against a wall, facing the muzzles of
 the muskets, often so many poor wretches in the band at once that the
 bullets did not suffice for all and it became necessary to finish the
 wounded with the bayonet. From morning until night the place was streaming
 with blood; the tumbrils were kept busy bearing away the bodies of the
 dead. And throughout the length and breadth of the city, keeping pace with
 the revengeful clamors of the people, other executions were continually
 taking place, in front of barricades, against the walls in the deserted
 streets, on the steps of the public buildings. It was under such
 circumstances that Jean saw a woman and two men dragged by the residents
 of the quartier before the officer commanding the detachment that was
 guarding the Theatre Francais. The citizens showed themselves more
 bloodthirsty than the soldiery, and those among the newspapers that had
 resumed publication were howling for measures of extermination. A
 threatening crowd surrounded the prisoners and was particularly violent
 against the woman, in whom the excited bourgeois beheld one of those <i>petroleuses</i>
 who were the constant bugbear of terror-haunted imaginations, whom they
 accused of prowling by night, slinking along the darkened streets past the
 dwellings of the wealthy, to throw cans of lighted petroleum into
 unprotected cellars. This woman, was the cry, had been found bending over
 a coal-hole in the Rue Sainte-Anne. And notwithstanding her denials,
 accompanied by tears and supplications, she was hurled, together with the
 two men, to the bottom of the ditch in front of an abandoned barricade,
 and there, lying in the mud and slime, they were shot with as little pity
 as wolves caught in a trap. Some by-passers stopped and looked
 indifferently on the scene, among them a lady hanging on her husband's
 arm, while a baker's boy, who was carrying home a tart to someone in the
 neighborhood, whistled the refrain of a popular air.
 </p>
 <p>
 As Jean, sick at heart, was hurrying along the street toward the house in
 the Rue des Orties, a sudden recollection flashed across his mind. Was not
 that Chouteau, the former member of his squad, whom he had seen, in the
 blouse of a respectable workman, watching the execution and testifying his
 approval of it in a loud-mouthed way? He was a proficient in his role of
 bandit, traitor, robber, and assassin! For a moment the corporal thought
 he would retrace his steps, denounce him, and send him to keep company
 with the other three. Ah, the sadness of the thought; the guilty ever
 escaping punishment, parading their unwhipped infamy in the bright light
 of day, while the innocent molder in the earth!
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette had come out upon the landing at the sound of footsteps coming
 up the stairs, where she welcomed Jean with a manner that indicated great
 alarm.
 </p>
 <p>
 "'Sh! he has been extremely violent all day long. The major was here, I am
 in despair&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Bouroche, in fact, had shaken his head ominously, saying he could promise
 nothing as yet. Nevertheless the patient might pull through, in spite of
 all the evil consequences he feared; he had youth on his side.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, here you are at last," Maurice said impatiently to Jean, as soon as
 he set eyes on him. "I have been waiting for you. What is going on&mdash;how
 do matters stand?" And supported by the pillows at his back, his face to
 the window which he had forced his sister to open for him, he pointed with
 his finger to the city, where, on the gathering darkness, the lambent
 flames were beginning to rise anew. "You see, it is breaking out again;
 Paris is burning. All Paris will burn this time!"
 </p>
 <p>
 As soon as daylight began to fade, the distant quarters beyond the Seine
 had been lighted up by the burning of the Grenier d'Abondance. From time
 to time there was an outburst of flame, accompanied by a shower of sparks,
 from the smoking ruins of the Tuileries, as some wall or ceiling fell and
 set the smoldering timbers blazing afresh. Many houses, where the fire was
 supposed to be extinguished, flamed up anew; for the last three days, as
 soon as darkness descended on the city it seemed as if it were the signal
 for the conflagrations to break out again; as if the shades of night had
 breathed upon the still glowing embers, reanimating them, and scattering
 them to the four corners of the horizon. Ah, that city of the damned, that
 had harbored for a week within its bosom the demon of destruction,
 incarnadining the sky each evening as soon as twilight fell, illuminating
 with its infernal torches the nights of that week of slaughter! And when,
 that night, the docks at la Villette burned, the light they shed upon the
 huge city was so intense that it seemed to be on fire in every part at
 once, overwhelmed and drowned beneath the sea of flame.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, it is the end!" Maurice repeated. "Paris is doomed!"
 </p>
 <p>
 He reiterated the words again and again with apparent relish, actuated by
 a feverish desire to hear the sound of his voice once more, after the dull
 lethargy that had kept him tongue-tied for three days. But the sound of
 stifled sobs causes him to turn his head.
 </p>
 <p>
 "What, sister, you, brave little woman that you are! You weep because I am
 about to die&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 She interrupted him, protesting:
 </p>
 <p>
 "But you are not going to die!"
 </p>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes; it is better it should be so; it must be so. Ah, I shall be no
 great loss to anyone. Up to the time the war broke out I was a source of
 anxiety to you, I cost you dearly in heart and purse. All the folly and
 the madness I was guilty of, and which would have landed me, who knows
 where? in prison, in the gutter&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Again she took the words from his mouth, exclaiming hotly:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Hush! be silent!&mdash;you have atoned for all."
 </p>
 <p>
 He reflected a moment. "Yes, perhaps I shall have atoned, when I am dead.
 Ah, Jean, old fellow, you didn't know what a service you were rendering us
 all when you gave me that bayonet thrust."
 </p>
 <p>
 But the other protested, his eyes swimming with tears:
 </p>
 <p>
 "Don't, I entreat you, say such things! do you wish to make me go and dash
 out my brains against a wall?"
 </p>
 <p>
 Maurice pursued his train of thought, speaking in hurried, eager tones.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Remember what you said to me the day after Sedan, that it was not such a
 bad thing, now and then, to receive a good drubbing. And you added that if
 a man had gangrene in his system, if he saw one of his limbs wasting from
 mortification, it would be better to take an ax and chop off that limb
 than to die from the contamination of the poison. I have many a time
 thought of those words since I have been here, without a friend, immured
 in this city of distress and madness. And I am the diseased limb, and it
 is you who have lopped it off&mdash;" He went on with increasing
 vehemence, regardless of the supplications of his terrified auditors, in a
 fervid tirade that abounded with symbols and striking images. It was the
 untainted, the reasoning, the substantial portion of France, the
 peasantry, the tillers of the soil, those who had always kept close
 contact with their mother Earth, that was suppressing the outbreak of the
 crazed, exasperated part, the part that had been vitiated by the Empire
 and led astray by vain illusions and empty dreams; and in the performance
 of its duty it had had to cut deep into the living flesh, without being
 fully aware of what it was doing. But the baptism of blood, French blood,
 was necessary; the abominable holocaust, the living sacrifice, in the
 midst of the purifying flames. Now they had mounted the steps of the
 Calvary and known their bitterest agony; the crucified nation had expiated
 its faults and would be born again. "Jean, old friend, you and those like
 you are strong in your simplicity and honesty. Go, take up the spade and
 the trowel, turn the sod in the abandoned field, rebuild the house! As for
 me, you did well to lop me off, since I was the ulcer that was eating away
 your strength!"
 </p>
 <p>
 After that his language became more and more incoherent; he insisted on
 rising and going to sit by the window. "Paris burns, Paris burns; not a
 stone of it will be left standing. Ah! the fire that I invoked, it
 destroys, but it heals; yes, the work it does is good. Let me go down
 there; let me help to finish the work of humanity and liberty&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Jean had the utmost difficulty in getting him back to bed, while Henriette
 tearfully recalled memories of their childhood, and entreated him, for the
 sake of the love they bore each other, to be calm. Over the immensity of
 Paris the fiery glow deepened and widened; the sea of flame seemed to be
 invading the remotest quarters of the horizon; the heavens were like the
 vaults of a colossal oven, heated to red heat. And athwart the red light
 of the conflagrations the dense black smoke-clouds from the Ministry of
 Finance, which had been burning three days and given forth no blaze,
 continued to pour in unbroken, slow procession.
 </p>
 <p>
 The following, Saturday, morning brought with it a decided improvement in
 Maurice's condition: he was much calmer, the fever had subsided, and it
 afforded Jean inexpressible delight to behold a smile on Henriette's face
 once more, as the young woman fondly reverted to her cherished dream, a
 pact of reciprocal affection between the three of them, that should unite
 them in a future that might yet be one of happiness, under conditions that
 she did not care to formulate even to herself. Would destiny be merciful?
 Would it save them all from an eternal farewell by saving her brother? Her
 nights were spent in watching him; she never stirred outside that chamber,
 where her noiseless activity and gentle ministrations were like a
 never-ceasing caress. And Jean, that evening, while sitting with his
 friends, forgot his great sorrow in a delight that astonished him and made
 him tremble. The troops had carried Belleville and the Buttes-Chaumont
 that day; the only remaining point where there was any resistance now was
 the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, which had been converted into a fortified
 camp. It seemed to him that the insurrection was ended; he even declared
 that the troops had ceased to shoot their prisoners, who were being
 collected in droves and sent on to Versailles. He told of one of those
 bands that he had seen that morning on the <i>quai</i>, made up of men of
 every class, from the most respectable to the lowest, and of women of all
 ages and conditions, wrinkled old bags and young girls, mere children, not
 yet out of their teens; pitiful aggregation of misery and revolt, driven
 like cattle by the soldiers along the street in the bright sunshine, and
 that the people of Versailles, so it was said, received with revilings and
 blows.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Sunday was to Jean a day of terror. It rounded out and fitly ended
 that accursed week. With the triumphant rising of the sun on that bright,
 warm Sabbath morning he shudderingly heard the news that was the
 culmination of all preceding horrors. It was only at that late day that
 the public was informed of the murder of the hostages; the archbishop, the
 cure of the Madeleine and others, shot at la Roquette on Wednesday, the
 Dominicans of Arcueil coursed like hares on Thursday, more priests and
 gendarmes, to the number of forty-seven in all, massacred in cold blood in
 the Rue Haxo on Friday; and a furious cry went up for vengeance, the
 soldiers bunched the last prisoners they made and shot them in mass. All
 day long on that magnificent Sunday the volleys of musketry rang out in
 the courtyard of the Lobau barracks, that were filled with blood and smoke
 and the groans of the dying. At la Roquette two hundred and twenty-seven
 miserable wretches, gathered in here and there by the drag-net of the
 police, were collected in a huddle, and the soldiers fired volley after
 volley into the mass of human beings until there was no further sign of
 life. At Pere-Lachaise, which had been shelled continuously for four days
 and was finally carried by a hand-to-hand conflict among the graves, a
 hundred and forty-eight of the insurgents were drawn up in line before a
 wall, and when the firing ceased the stones were weeping great tears of
 blood; and three of them, despite their wounds, having succeeded in making
 their escape, they were retaken and despatched. Among the twelve thousand
 victims of the Commune, who shall say how many innocent people suffered
 for every malefactor who met his deserts! An order to stop the executions
 had been issued from Versailles, so it was said, but none the less the
 slaughter still went on; Thiers, while hailed as the savior of his
 country, was to bear the stigma of having been the Jack Ketch of Paris,
 and Marshal MacMahon, the vanquished of Froeschwiller, whose proclamation
 announcing the triumph of law and order was to be seen on every wall, was
 to receive the credit of the victory of Pere-Lachaise. And in the pleasant
 sunshine Paris, attired in holiday garb, appeared to be <i>en fete</i>;
 the reconquered streets were filled with an enormous crowd; men and women,
 glad to breathe the air of heaven once more, strolled leisurely from spot
 to spot to view the smoking ruins; mothers, holding their little children
 by the hand, stopped for a moment and listened with an air of interest to
 the deadened crash of musketry from the Lobau barracks.
 </p>
 <p>
 When Jean ascended the dark staircase of the house in the Rue des Orties,
 in the gathering obscurity of that Sunday evening, his heart was oppressed
 by a chill sense of impending evil. He entered the room, and saw at once
 that the inevitable end was come; Maurice lay dead on the little bed; the
 hemorrhage predicted by Bouroche had done its work. The red light of the
 setting sun streamed through the open window and rested on the wall as if
 in a last farewell; two tapers were burning on a table beside the bed. And
 Henriette, alone with her dead, in her widow's weeds that she had not laid
 aside, was weeping silently.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the noise of footsteps she raised her head, and shuddered on beholding
 Jean. He, in his wild despair, was about to hurry toward her and seize her
 hands, mingle his grief with hers in a sympathetic clasp, but he saw the
 little hands were trembling, he felt as by instinct the repulsion that
 pervaded all her being and was to part them for evermore. Was not all
 ended between them now? Maurice's grave would be there, a yawning chasm,
 to part them as long as they should live. And he could only fall to his
 knees by the bedside of his dead friend, sobbing softly. After the silence
 had lasted some moments, however, Henriette spoke:
 </p>
 <p>
 "I had turned my back and was preparing a cup of bouillon, when he gave a
 cry. I hastened to his side, but had barely time to reach the bed before
 he expired, with my name upon his lips, and yours as well, amid an outgush
 of blood&mdash;"
 </p>
 <p>
 Her Maurice, her twin brother, whom she might almost be said to have loved
 in the prenatal state, her other self, whom she had watched over and
 saved! sole object of her affection since at Bazeilles she had seen her
 poor Weiss set against a wall and shot to death! And now cruel war had
 done its worst by her, had crushed her bleeding heart; henceforth her way
 through life was to be a solitary one, widowed and forsaken as she was,
 with no one upon whom to bestow her love.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Ah, <i>bon sang</i>!" cried Jean, amid his sobs, "behold my work! My poor
 little one, for whom I would have laid down my life, and whom I murdered,
 brute that I am! What is to become of us? Can you ever forgive me?"
 </p>
 <p>
 At that moment their glances met, and they were stricken with
 consternation at what they read in each other's eyes. The past rose before
 them, the secluded chamber at Remilly, where they had spent so many
 melancholy yet happy days. His dream returned to him, that dream of which
 at first he had been barely conscious and which even at a later period
 could not be said to have assumed definite shape: life down there in the
 pleasant country by the Meuse, marriage, a little house, a little field to
 till whose produce should suffice for the needs of two people whose ideas
 were not extravagant. Now the dream was become an eager longing, a
 penetrating conviction that, with a wife as loving and industrious as she,
 existence would be a veritable earthly paradise. And she, the tranquillity
 of whose mind had never in those days been ruffled by thoughts of that
 nature, in the chaste and unconscious bestowal of her heart, now saw
 clearly and understood the true condition of her feelings. That marriage,
 of which she had not admitted to herself the possibility, had been,
 unknown to her, the object of her desire. The seed that had germinated had
 pushed its way in silence and in darkness; it was love, not sisterly
 affection, that she bore toward that young man whose company had at first
 been to her nothing more than a source of comfort and consolation. And
 that was what their eyes told each other, and the love thus openly
 expressed could have no other fruition than an eternal farewell. It needed
 but that frightful sacrifice, the rending of their heart-strings by that
 supreme parting, the prospect of their life's happiness wrecked amid all
 the other ruins, swept away by the crimson tide that ended their brother's
 life.
 </p>
 <p>
 With a slow and painful effort Jean rose from his knees.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell!"
 </p>
 <p>
 Henriette stood motionless in her place.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell!"
 </p>
 <p>
 But Jean could not tear himself away thus. Advancing to the bedside he
 sorrowfully scanned the dead man's face, with its lofty forehead that
 seemed loftier still in death, its wasted features, its dull eyes, whence
 the wild look that had occasionally been seen there in life had vanished.
 He longed to give a parting kiss to his little one, as he had called him
 so many times, but dared not. It seemed to him that his hands were stained
 with his friend's blood; he shrank from the horror of the ordeal. Ah, what
 a death to die, amid the crashing ruins of a sinking world! On the last
 day, among the shattered fragments of the dying Commune, might not this
 last victim have been spared? He had gone from life, hungering for
 justice, possessed by the dream that haunted him, the sublime and
 unattainable conception of the destruction of the old society, of Paris
 chastened by fire, of the field dug up anew, that from the soil thus
 renewed and purified might spring the idyl of another golden age.
 </p>
 <p>
 His heart overflowing with bitter anguish, Jean turned and looked out on
 Paris. The setting sun lay on the edge of the horizon, and its level rays
 bathed the city in a flood of vividly red light. The windows in thousands
 of houses flamed as if lighted by fierce fires within; the roofs glowed
 like beds of live coals; bits of gray wall and tall, sober-hued monuments
 flashed in the evening air with the sparkle of a brisk fire of brushwood.
 It was like the show-piece that is reserved for the conclusion of a <i>fete</i>,
 the huge bouquet of gold and crimson, as if Paris were burning like a
 forest of old oaks and soaring heavenward in a rutilant cloud of sparks
 and flame. The fires were burning still; volumes of reddish smoke
 continued to rise into the air; a confused murmur in the distance sounded
 on the ear, perhaps the last groans of the dying Communists at the Lobau
 barracks, or it may have been the happy laughter of women and children,
 ending their pleasant afternoon by dining in the open air at the doors of
 the wine-shops. And in the midst of all the splendor of that royal sunset,
 while a large part of Paris was crumbling away in ashes, from plundered
 houses and gutted palaces, from the torn-up streets, from the depths of
 all that ruin and suffering, came sounds of life.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then Jean had a strange experience. It seemed to him that in the slowly
 fading daylight, above the roofs of that flaming city, he beheld the
 dawning of another day. And yet the situation might well be considered
 irretrievable. Destiny appeared to have pursued them with her utmost fury;
 the successive disasters they had sustained were such as no nation in
 history had ever known before; defeat treading on the heels of defeat,
 their provinces torn from them, an indemnity of milliards to be raised, a
 most horrible civil war that had been quenched in blood, their streets
 cumbered with ruins and unburied corpses, without money, their honor gone,
 and order to be re-established out of chaos! His share of the universal
 ruin was a heart lacerated by the loss of Maurice and Henriette, the
 prospect of a happy future swept away in the furious storm! And still,
 beyond the flames of that furnace whose fiery glow had not subsided yet,
 Hope, the eternal, sat enthroned in the limpid serenity of the tranquil
 heavens. It was the certain assurance of the resurrection of perennial
 nature, of imperishable humanity; the harvest that is promised to him who
 sows and waits; the tree throwing out a new and vigorous shoot to replace
 the rotten limb that has been lopped away, which was blighting the young
 leaves with its vitiated sap.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell!" Jean repeated with a sob.
 </p>
 <p>
 "Farewell!" murmured Henriette, her bowed face hidden in her hands.
 </p>
 <p>
 The neglected field was overgrown with brambles, the roof-tree of the
 ruined house lay on the ground; and Jean, bearing his heavy burden of
 affliction with humble resignation, went his way, his face set resolutely
 toward the future, toward the glorious and arduous task that lay before
 him and his countrymen, to create a new France.
 </p>
 <p>

1.F.

collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
