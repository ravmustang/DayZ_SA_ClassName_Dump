 CHAPTER I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
 Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. &nbsp;That book was
 made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. &nbsp;There was
 things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. &nbsp;That is
 nothing. &nbsp;I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without
 it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. &nbsp;Aunt Polly?Tom's
 Aunt Polly, she is?and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about
 in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
 before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now the way that the book winds up is this: &nbsp;Tom and me found the
 money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. &nbsp;We got
 six thousand dollars apiece?all gold. &nbsp;It was an awful sight of
 money when it was piled up. &nbsp;Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put
 it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
 round?more than a body could tell what to do with. &nbsp;The Widow
 Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it
 was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
 and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it
 no longer I lit out. &nbsp;I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
 again, and was free and satisfied. &nbsp;But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up
 and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
 would go back to the widow and be respectable. &nbsp;So I went back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
 called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
 She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat
 and sweat, and feel all cramped up. &nbsp;Well, then, the old thing
 commenced again. &nbsp;The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
 come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating,
 but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a
 little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter
 with them,?that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.
 &nbsp;In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up,
 and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
 Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
 she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
 I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead
 people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. &nbsp;But
 she wouldn't. &nbsp;She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and
 I must try to not do it any more. &nbsp;That is just the way with some
 people. &nbsp;They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about
 it. &nbsp;Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her,
 and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault
 with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. &nbsp;And she took
 snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
 just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.
 She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her
 ease up. &nbsp;I couldn't stood it much longer. &nbsp;Then for an hour it
 was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. &nbsp;Miss Watson would say, "Don't
 put your feet up there, Huckleberry;" and "Don't scrunch up like that,
 Huckleberry?set up straight;" and pretty soon she would say, "Don't
 gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry?why don't you try to behave?"
 &nbsp;Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was
 there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. &nbsp;All I wanted was
 to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. &nbsp;She
 said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the
 whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. &nbsp;Well,
 I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my
 mind I wouldn't try for it. &nbsp;But I never said so, because it would
 only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
 place. &nbsp;She said all a body would have to do there was to go around
 all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. &nbsp;So I didn't
 think much of it. But I never said so. &nbsp;I asked her if she reckoned
 Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.
 &nbsp;I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
 &nbsp;By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
 everybody was off to bed. &nbsp;I went up to my room with a piece of
 candle, and put it on the table. &nbsp;Then I set down in a chair by the
 window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.
 &nbsp;I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. &nbsp;The stars were
 shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard
 an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a
 whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the
 wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what
 it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the
 woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to
 tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood,
 and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every
 night grieving. &nbsp;I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had
 some company. &nbsp;Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and
 I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was
 all shriveled up. &nbsp;I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an
 awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most
 shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three
 times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock
 of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. &nbsp;But I hadn't no
 confidence. &nbsp;You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've
 found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard
 anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a
 spider.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for
 the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know.
 Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom?boom?boom?twelve
 licks; and all still again?stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a
 twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees?something was a
 stirring. &nbsp;I set still and listened. &nbsp;Directly I could just
 barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. &nbsp;That was good! &nbsp;Says
 I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and
 scrambled out of the window on to the shed. &nbsp;Then I slipped down to
 the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom
 Sawyer waiting for me.

 <p>
 <br> <br> CHAPTER II.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
 the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our
 heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a
 noise. &nbsp;We scrouched down and laid still. &nbsp;Miss Watson's big
 nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him
 pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. &nbsp;He got up and
 stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. &nbsp;Then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who dah?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between
 us; we could a touched him, nearly. &nbsp;Well, likely it was minutes and
 minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together.
 &nbsp;There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn't
 scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between
 my shoulders. &nbsp;Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. &nbsp;Well,
 I've noticed that thing plenty times since. &nbsp;If you are with the
 quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy?if
 you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch
 all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, who is you? &nbsp;Whar is you? &nbsp;Dog my cats ef I didn' hear
 sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: &nbsp;I's gwyne to set down
 here and listen tell I hears it agin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. &nbsp;He leaned his back
 up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
 touched one of mine. &nbsp;My nose begun to itch. &nbsp;It itched till the
 tears come into my eyes. &nbsp;But I dasn't scratch. &nbsp;Then it begun
 to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. &nbsp;I didn't
 know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as
 six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. &nbsp;I was
 itching in eleven different places now. &nbsp;I reckoned I couldn't stand
 it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.
 &nbsp;Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore?and
 then I was pretty soon comfortable again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom he made a sign to me?kind of a little noise with his mouth?and
 we went creeping away on our hands and knees. &nbsp;When we was ten foot
 off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. &nbsp;But
 I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out
 I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip
 in the kitchen and get some more. &nbsp;I didn't want him to try. &nbsp;I
 said Jim might wake up and come. &nbsp;But Tom wanted to resk it; so we
 slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table
 for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing
 would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees,
 and play something on him. &nbsp;I waited, and it seemed a good while,
 everything was so still and lonesome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
 and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
 the house. &nbsp;Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
 on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.
 Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
 and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
 and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. &nbsp;And next time Jim
 told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
 time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
 rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was
 all over saddle-boils. &nbsp;Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got
 so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. &nbsp;Niggers would come
 miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
 nigger in that country. &nbsp;Strange niggers would stand with their
 mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. &nbsp;Niggers
 is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
 whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim
 would happen in and say, "Hm! &nbsp;What you know 'bout witches?" and that
 nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. &nbsp;Jim always kept
 that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
 charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure
 anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying
 something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. &nbsp;Niggers
 would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for
 a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the
 devil had had his hands on it. &nbsp;Jim was most ruined for a servant,
 because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode
 by witches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
 into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there
 was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;
 and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still
 and grand. &nbsp;We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
 and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. &nbsp;So we
 unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the
 big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
 secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
 part of the bushes. &nbsp;Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
 hands and knees. &nbsp;We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
 opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
 under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. &nbsp;We
 went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty
 and cold, and there we stopped. &nbsp;Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.
 Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
 in blood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody was willing. &nbsp;So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
 wrote the oath on, and read it. &nbsp;It swore every boy to stick to the
 band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
 any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
 family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had
 killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the
 band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and
 if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed.
 &nbsp;And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must
 have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes
 scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and
 never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be
 forgot forever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
 out of his own head. &nbsp;He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
 pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some thought it would be good to kill the <i>families</i> of boys that told the
 secrets. &nbsp;Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
 it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout
 him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. &nbsp;He
 used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in
 these parts for a year or more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said
 every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be
 fair and square for the others. &nbsp;Well, nobody could think of anything
 to do?everybody was stumped, and set still. &nbsp;I was most ready
 to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
 Watson?they could kill her. &nbsp;Everybody said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, she'll do. &nbsp;That's all right. &nbsp;Huck can come in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and
 I made my mark on the paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this Gang?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But who are we going to rob??houses, or cattle, or?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,"
 says Tom Sawyer. &nbsp;"We ain't burglars. &nbsp;That ain't no sort of
 style. &nbsp;We are highwaymen. &nbsp;We stop stages and carriages on the
 road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and
 money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Must we always kill the people?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, certainly. &nbsp;It's best. &nbsp;Some authorities think different,
 but mostly it's considered best to kill them?except some that you
 bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ransomed? &nbsp;What's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. &nbsp;But that's what they do. &nbsp;I've seen it in books;
 and so of course that's what we've got to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, blame it all, we've <i>got</i> to do it. &nbsp;Don't I tell you it's in the
 books? &nbsp;Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the
 books, and get things all muddled up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's all very fine to <i>say</i>, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are
 these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them??that's
 the thing I want to get at. &nbsp;Now, what do you reckon it is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't know. &nbsp;But per'aps if we keep them till they're
 ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, that's something <i>like</i>. &nbsp;That'll answer. &nbsp;Why couldn't you
 said that before? &nbsp;We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death;
 and a bothersome lot they'll be, too?eating up everything, and
 always trying to get loose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you talk, Ben Rogers. &nbsp;How can they get loose when there's a
 guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A guard! &nbsp;Well, that <i>is</i> good. &nbsp;So somebody's got to set up all
 night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. &nbsp;I think
 that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon
 as they get here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because it ain't in the books so?that's why. &nbsp;Now, Ben Rogers,
 do you want to do things regular, or don't you??that's the idea.
 &nbsp;Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's
 the correct thing to do? &nbsp;Do you reckon <i>you</i> can learn 'em anything?
 &nbsp;Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the
 regular way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. &nbsp;I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. &nbsp;Say,
 do we kill the women, too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. &nbsp;Kill
 the women? &nbsp;No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.
 &nbsp;You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to
 them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home
 any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.
 Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
 waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers. But
 go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
 scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't
 want to be a robber any more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
 mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. &nbsp;But
 Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
 meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
 to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on
 Sunday, and that settled the thing. &nbsp;They agreed to get together and
 fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
 captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.
 My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER III.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
 account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned
 off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave
 awhile if I could. &nbsp;Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and
 prayed, but nothing come of it. &nbsp;She told me to pray every day, and
 whatever I asked for I would get it. &nbsp;But it warn't so. &nbsp;I tried
 it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. &nbsp;It warn't any good to me
 without hooks. &nbsp;I tried for the hooks three or four times, but
 somehow I couldn't make it work. &nbsp;By and by, one day, I asked Miss
 Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. &nbsp;She never told me
 why, and I couldn't make it out no way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
 &nbsp;I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why
 don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? &nbsp;Why can't the
 widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? &nbsp;Why can't Miss
 Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. &nbsp;I
 went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get
 by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." &nbsp;This was too many for me,
 but she told me what she meant?I must help other people, and do
 everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time,
 and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took
 it. &nbsp;I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long
 time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it?except for the other
 people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just
 let it go. &nbsp;Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about
 Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss
 Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. &nbsp;I judged I could
 see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand
 considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got
 him there warn't no help for him any more. &nbsp;I thought it all out, and
 reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't
 make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was
 before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for
 me; I didn't want to see him no more. &nbsp;He used to always whale me
 when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to
 the woods most of the time when he was around. &nbsp;Well, about this time
 he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
 people said. &nbsp;They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man
 was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was
 all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it
 had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. &nbsp;They
 said he was floating on his back in the water. &nbsp;They took him and
 buried him on the bank. &nbsp;But I warn't comfortable long, because I
 happened to think of something. &nbsp;I knowed mighty well that a drownded
 man don't float on his back, but on his face. &nbsp;So I knowed, then,
 that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. &nbsp;So
 I was uncomfortable again. &nbsp;I judged the old man would turn up again
 by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. &nbsp;All
 the boys did. &nbsp;We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but
 only just pretended. &nbsp;We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
 down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but
 we never hived any of them. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," and
 he called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and
 powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and
 marked. &nbsp;But I couldn't see no profit in it. &nbsp;One time Tom sent
 a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
 (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had
 got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
 merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
 hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter"
 mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of
 four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it,
 and kill the lot and scoop the things. &nbsp;He said we must slick up our
 swords and guns, and get ready. &nbsp;He never could go after even a
 turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
 though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
 till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than
 what they was before. &nbsp;I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of
 Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I
 was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word
 we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. &nbsp;But there warn't no
 Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. &nbsp;It
 warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at
 that. &nbsp;We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
 never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag
 doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher
 charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

 <p>
 &nbsp;I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. &nbsp;He said
 there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there,
 too, and elephants and things. &nbsp;I said, why couldn't we see them,
 then? &nbsp;He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called
 Don Quixote, I would know without asking. &nbsp;He said it was all done by
 enchantment. &nbsp;He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and
 elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called
 magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant
 Sunday-school, just out of spite. &nbsp;I said, all right; then the thing
 for us to do was to go for the magicians. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer said I was a
 numskull.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would
 hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. &nbsp;They
 are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies to help <i>us</i>?can't we lick
 the other crowd then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you going to get them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. &nbsp;How do <i>they</i> get them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come
 tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke
 a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it. &nbsp;They
 don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a
 Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it?or any other
 man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who makes them tear around so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. &nbsp;They belong to whoever rubs
 the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. &nbsp;If he
 tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill it
 full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's daughter
 from China for you to marry, they've got to do it?and they've got to
 do it before sun-up next morning, too. &nbsp;And more: &nbsp;they've got
 to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
 understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the
 palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. &nbsp;And what's
 more?if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I
 would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin
 lamp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you talk, Huck Finn. &nbsp;Why, you'd <i>have</i> to come when he rubbed it,
 whether you wanted to or not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? &nbsp;All right,
 then; I <i>would</i> come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree
 there was in the country."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. &nbsp;You don't seem
 to know anything, somehow?perfect saphead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would
 see if there was anything in it. &nbsp;I got an old tin lamp and an iron
 ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an
 Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use,
 none of the genies come. &nbsp;So then I judged that all that stuff was
 only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. &nbsp;I reckoned he believed in the
 A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. &nbsp;It had
 all the marks of a Sunday-school.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now.
 I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write
 just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times
 seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than
 that if I was to live forever. &nbsp;I don't take no stock in mathematics,
 anyway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
 Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
 day done me good and cheered me up. &nbsp;So the longer I went to school
 the easier it got to be. &nbsp;I was getting sort of used to the widow's
 ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. &nbsp;Living in a house and
 sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold
 weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that
 was a rest to me. &nbsp;I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I
 liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along
 slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. &nbsp;She said she warn't
 ashamed of me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. &nbsp;I
 reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
 and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed
 me off. She says, "Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are
 always making!" &nbsp;The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't
 going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. &nbsp;I started
 out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it
 was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. &nbsp;There is ways
 to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I
 never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the
 watch-out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
 through the high board fence. &nbsp;There was an inch of new snow on the
 ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. &nbsp;They had come up from the
 quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the
 garden fence. &nbsp;It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing
 around so. &nbsp;I couldn't make it out. &nbsp;It was very curious,
 somehow. &nbsp;I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at
 the tracks first. &nbsp;I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did.
 &nbsp;There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep
 off the devil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. &nbsp;I looked over my
 shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. &nbsp;I was at Judge
 Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. &nbsp;He said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. &nbsp;Did you come for your
 interest?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night?over a hundred and fifty
 dollars. &nbsp;Quite a fortune for you. &nbsp;You had better let me invest
 it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. &nbsp;I don't want it at all?nor
 the six thousand, nuther. &nbsp;I want you to take it; I want to give it
 to you?the six thousand and all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked surprised. &nbsp;He couldn't seem to make it out. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what can you mean, my boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. &nbsp;You'll take
 it?won't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm puzzled. &nbsp;Is something the matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing?then I won't
 have to tell no lies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He studied a while, and then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oho-o! &nbsp;I think I see. &nbsp;You want to <i>sell</i> all your property to
 me?not give it. &nbsp;That's the correct idea."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' &nbsp;That means I have
 bought it of you and paid you for it. &nbsp;Here's a dollar for you.
 &nbsp;Now you sign it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I signed it, and left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had
 been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with
 it. &nbsp;He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
 everything. &nbsp;So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
 again, for I found his tracks in the snow. &nbsp;What I wanted to know
 was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? &nbsp;Jim got out
 his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and
 dropped it on the floor. &nbsp;It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about
 an inch. &nbsp;Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted
 just the same. &nbsp;Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it
 and listened. &nbsp;But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He
 said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. &nbsp;I told him I had an
 old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed
 through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass
 didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would
 tell on it every time. &nbsp;(I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the
 dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe
 the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the
 difference. &nbsp;Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would
 manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. &nbsp;He said he would
 split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it
 there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it
 wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a
 minute, let alone a hair-ball. &nbsp;Well, I knowed a potato would do that
 before, but I had forgot it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
 This time he said the hair-ball was all right. &nbsp;He said it would tell
 my whole fortune if I wanted it to. &nbsp;I says, go on. &nbsp;So the
 hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do. &nbsp;Sometimes he
 spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay. &nbsp;De bes' way is

 <p>
 When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his
 own self!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br>

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER V.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had shut the door to. &nbsp;Then I turned around and there he was.
 &nbsp;I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.
 &nbsp;I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was
 mistaken?that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my
 breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see
 I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was most fifty, and he looked it. &nbsp;His hair was long and tangled
 and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like
 he was behind vines. &nbsp;It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
 mixed-up whiskers. &nbsp;There warn't no color in his face, where his face
 showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a
 body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl?a tree-toad white, a
 fish-belly white. &nbsp;As for his clothes?just rags, that was all.
 &nbsp;He had one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was
 busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and
 then. &nbsp;His hat was laying on the floor?an old black slouch with
 the top caved in, like a lid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
 tilted back a little. &nbsp;I set the candle down. &nbsp;I noticed the
 window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. &nbsp;He kept a-looking me
 all over. &nbsp;By and by he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Starchy clothes?very. &nbsp;You think you're a good deal of a
 big-bug, <i>don't</i> you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he. &nbsp;"You've put on
 considerable many frills since I been away. &nbsp;I'll take you down a peg
 before I get done with you. &nbsp;You're educated, too, they say?can
 read and write. &nbsp;You think you're better'n your father, now, don't
 you, because he can't? &nbsp;<i>I'll</i> take it out of you. &nbsp;Who told you
 you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey??who told you
 you could?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The widow. &nbsp;She told me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The widow, hey??and who told the widow she could put in her shovel
 about a thing that ain't none of her business?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody never told her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. &nbsp;And looky here?you drop
 that school, you hear? &nbsp;I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on
 airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what <i>he</i> is. &nbsp;You
 lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? &nbsp;Your
 mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died.
 &nbsp;None of the family couldn't before <i>they</i> died. &nbsp;I can't; and
 here you're a-swelling yourself up like this. &nbsp;I ain't the man to
 stand it?you hear? Say, lemme hear you read."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
 wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
 with his hand and knocked it across the house. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's so. &nbsp;You can do it. &nbsp;I had my doubts when you told me.
 &nbsp;Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. &nbsp;I won't have
 it. &nbsp;I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that
 school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion, too. &nbsp;I
 never see such a son."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's this?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's something they give me for learning my lessons good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tore it up, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll give you something better?I'll give you a cowhide."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Ain't</i> you a sweet-scented dandy, though? &nbsp;A bed; and bedclothes; and
 a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor?and your own
 father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. &nbsp;I never see such a
 son. &nbsp;I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done
 with you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs?they say you're rich.
 &nbsp;Hey??how's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They lie?that's how."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here?mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can
 stand now?so don't gimme no sass. &nbsp;I've been in town two days,
 and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. &nbsp;I heard about
 it away down the river, too. &nbsp;That's why I come. &nbsp;You git me
 that money to-morrow?I want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't got no money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie. &nbsp;Judge Thatcher's got it. &nbsp;You git it. &nbsp;I want
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't got no money, I tell you. &nbsp;You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll
 tell you the same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. &nbsp;I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll
 know the reason why. &nbsp;Say, how much you got in your pocket? &nbsp;I
 want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It don't make no difference what you want it for?you just shell it
 out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going
 down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day. When he
 had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for
 putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he
 was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about
 that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't
 drop that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged
 him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then he
 swore he'd make the law force him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
 him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had
 just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't
 interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther
 not take a child away from its father. &nbsp;So Judge Thatcher and the
 widow had to quit on the business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. &nbsp;He said he'd cowhide
 me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. &nbsp;I
 borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk,
 and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he
 kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they
 jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again
 for a week. &nbsp;But he said <i>he</i> was satisfied; said he was boss of his
 son, and he'd make it warm for <i>him</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So
 he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had
 him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old
 pie to him, so to speak. &nbsp;And after supper he talked to him about
 temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a
 fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new
 leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge
 would help him and not look down on him. &nbsp;The judge said he could hug
 him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said
 he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge
 said he believed it. &nbsp;The old man said that what a man wanted that
 was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again.
 &nbsp;And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
 There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's
 the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before he'll
 go back. &nbsp;You mark them words?don't forget I said them. &nbsp;It's
 a clean hand now; shake it?don't be afeard."

 So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. &nbsp;The
 judge's wife she kissed it. &nbsp;Then the old man he signed a pledge?made
 his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
 like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
 the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
 clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
 new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
 time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
 rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
 froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. &nbsp;And when they
 come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they
 could navigate it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The judge he felt kind of sore. &nbsp;He said he reckoned a body could
 reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
 for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
 went for me, too, for not stopping school. &nbsp;He catched me a couple of
 times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him
 or outrun him most of the time. &nbsp;I didn't want to go to school much
 before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. &nbsp;That law trial was a
 slow business?appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on
 it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
 for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. &nbsp;Every time he got money
 he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
 every time he raised Cain he got jailed. &nbsp;He was just suited?this
 kind of thing was right in his line.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last
 that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him.
 Well, <i>wasn't</i> he mad? &nbsp;He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss.
 &nbsp;So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and
 took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the
 Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old
 log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if
 you didn't know where it was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We
 lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key
 under his head nights. &nbsp;He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
 and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. &nbsp;Every
 little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to
 the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and
 got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. &nbsp;The widow she found
 out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of
 me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till
 I was used to being where I was, and liked it?all but the cowhide
 part.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and
 fishing, and no books nor study. &nbsp;Two months or more run along, and
 my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got
 to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a
 plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
 bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
 time. &nbsp;I didn't want to go back no more. &nbsp;I had stopped cussing,
 because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap
 hadn't no objections. &nbsp;It was pretty good times up in the woods
 there, take it all around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it.
 I was all over welts. &nbsp;He got to going away so much, too, and locking
 me in. &nbsp;Once he locked me in and was gone three days. &nbsp;It was
 dreadful lonesome. &nbsp;I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever
 going to get out any more. &nbsp;I was scared. &nbsp;I made up my mind I
 would fix up some way to leave there. &nbsp;I had tried to get out of that
 cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. &nbsp;There warn't a window
 to it big enough for a dog to get through. &nbsp;I couldn't get up the
 chimbly; it was too narrow. &nbsp;The door was thick, solid oak slabs.
 &nbsp;Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin
 when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a
 hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about
 the only way to put in the time. &nbsp;But this time I found something at
 last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in
 between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went
 to work. &nbsp;There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at
 the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing
 through the chinks and putting the candle out. &nbsp;I got under the table
 and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big
 bottom log out?big enough to let me through. &nbsp;Well, it was a
 good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's
 gun in the woods. &nbsp;I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the
 blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pap warn't in a good humor?so he was his natural self. &nbsp;He said
 he was down town, and everything was going wrong. &nbsp;His lawyer said he
 reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got
 started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time,
 and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd
 be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
 guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. &nbsp;This shook me up
 considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and
 be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. &nbsp;Then the old man
 got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and
 then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and
 after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
 including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names
 of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right
 along with his cussing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He said he would like to see the widow get me. &nbsp;He said he would
 watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
 place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
 dropped and they couldn't find me. &nbsp;That made me pretty uneasy again,
 but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that
 chance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There
 was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and
 a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for
 wadding, besides some tow. &nbsp;I toted up a load, and went back and set
 down on the bow of the skiff to rest. &nbsp;I thought it all over, and I
 reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the
 woods when I run away. &nbsp;I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but
 just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish
 to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
 couldn't ever find me any more. &nbsp;I judged I would saw out and leave
 that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. &nbsp;I got
 so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man
 hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. &nbsp;While
 I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed
 up, and went to ripping again. &nbsp;He had been drunk over in town, and
 laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. &nbsp;A body
 would a thought he was Adam?he was just all mud. &nbsp;Whenever his
 liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like. Here's
 the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him?a man's
 own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the
 expense of raising. &nbsp;Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at
 last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for <i>him</i> and give him
 a rest, the law up and goes for him. &nbsp;And they call <i>that</i> govment!
 &nbsp;That ain't all, nuther. &nbsp;The law backs that old Judge Thatcher
 up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. &nbsp;Here's what the law
 does: &nbsp;The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards,
 and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round
 in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! &nbsp;A
 man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty
 notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <i>told</i> 'em so;
 I told old Thatcher so to his face. &nbsp;Lots of 'em heard me, and can
 tell what I said. &nbsp;Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country
 and never come a-near it agin. &nbsp;Them's the very words. &nbsp;I says
 look at my hat?if you call it a hat?but the lid raises up and
 the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't
 rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint
 o' stove-pipe. &nbsp;Look at it, says I?such a hat for me to wear?one
 of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. &nbsp;Why, looky here.
 There was a free nigger there from Ohio?a mulatter, most as white as
 a white man. &nbsp;He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
 shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
 clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
 silver-headed cane?the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.
 &nbsp;And what do you think? &nbsp;They said he was a p'fessor in a
 college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.
 &nbsp;And that ain't the wust. They said he could <i>vote</i> when he was at
 home. &nbsp;Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming
 to? &nbsp;It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself
 if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a
 State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.
 &nbsp;I says I'll never vote agin. &nbsp;Them's the very words I said;
 they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me?I'll never
 vote agin as long as I live. &nbsp;And to see the cool way of that nigger?why,
 he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way.
 &nbsp;I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and
 sold??that's what I want to know. &nbsp;And what do you reckon they
 said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six
 months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. &nbsp;There, now?that's
 a specimen. &nbsp;They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger
 till he's been in the State six months. &nbsp;Here's a govment that calls
 itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment,
 and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a
 hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking
 him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked
 both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
 language?mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
 the tub some, too, all along, here and there. &nbsp;He hopped around the
 cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first
 one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot
 all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. &nbsp;But it warn't
 good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes
 leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly
 made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there,
 and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
 ever done previous. &nbsp;He said so his own self afterwards. &nbsp;He had
 heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him,
 too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two
 drunks and one delirium tremens. &nbsp;That was always his word. &nbsp;I
 judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
 the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. &nbsp;He drank and drank, and
 tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. &nbsp;He
 didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. &nbsp;He groaned and moaned and
 thrashed around this way and that for a long time. &nbsp;At last I got so
 sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed
 what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful
 scream and I was up. &nbsp;There was pap looking wild, and skipping around
 every which way and yelling about snakes. &nbsp;He said they was crawling
 up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit
 him on the cheek?but I couldn't see no snakes. &nbsp;He started and
 run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's
 biting me on the neck!" &nbsp;I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.
 Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled
 over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking
 and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was
 devils a-hold of him. &nbsp;He wore out by and by, and laid still a while,
 moaning. &nbsp;Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. &nbsp;I
 could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed
 terrible still. &nbsp;He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
 raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. &nbsp;He says,
 very low:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tramp?tramp?tramp; that's the dead; tramp?tramp?tramp;
 they're coming after me; but I won't go. &nbsp;Oh, they're here! don't
 touch me?don't! hands off?they're cold; let go. &nbsp;Oh, let
 a poor devil alone!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
 alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
 old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. &nbsp;I could
 hear him through the blanket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see
 me and went for me. &nbsp;He chased me round and round the place with a
 clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
 and then I couldn't come for him no more. &nbsp;I begged, and told him I
 was only Huck; but he laughed <i>such</i> a screechy laugh, and roared and
 cussed, and kept on chasing me up. &nbsp;Once when I turned short and
 dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
 shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as
 lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped
 down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and
 then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get
 strong, and then he would see who was who.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he dozed off pretty soon. &nbsp;By and by I got the old split-bottom
 chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
 the gun. &nbsp;I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,
 then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set
 down behind it to wait for him to stir. &nbsp;And how slow and still the
 time did drag along.

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "GIT up! &nbsp;What you 'bout?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. &nbsp;It
 was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. &nbsp;Pap was standing over
 me looking sour and sick, too. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What you doin' with this gun?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you roust me out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, all right. &nbsp;Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with
 you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. &nbsp;I'll be
 along in a minute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. &nbsp;I noticed
 some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
 bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. &nbsp;I reckoned I would
 have great times now if I was over at the town. &nbsp;The June rise used
 to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
 cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts?sometimes a dozen
 logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
 wood-yards and the sawmill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for
 what the rise might fetch along. &nbsp;Well, all at once here comes a
 canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
 high like a duck. &nbsp;I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
 clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. &nbsp;I just expected
 there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to
 fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise
 up and laugh at him. &nbsp;But it warn't so this time. &nbsp;It was a
 drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. &nbsp;Thinks
 I, the old man will be glad when he sees this?she's worth ten
 dollars. &nbsp;But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I
 was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines
 and willows, I struck another idea: &nbsp;I judged I'd hide her good, and
 then, 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river
 about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough
 time tramping on foot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
 coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a
 bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
 drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. &nbsp;So he hadn't seen anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he got along I was hard at it taking up a "trot" line. &nbsp;He
 abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river,
 and that was what made me so long. &nbsp;I knowed he would see I was wet,
 and then he would be asking questions. &nbsp;We got five catfish off the
 lines and went home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore
 out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the
 widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than
 trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all
 kinds of things might happen. &nbsp;Well, I didn't see no way for a while,
 but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and
 he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
 hear? That man warn't here for no good. &nbsp;I'd a shot him. &nbsp;Next
 time you roust me out, you hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying
 give me the very idea I wanted. &nbsp;I says to myself, I can fix it now
 so nobody won't think of following me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. &nbsp;The
 river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
 rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft?nine logs fast
 together. &nbsp;We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. &nbsp;Then
 we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so
 as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. &nbsp;Nine logs was
 enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. &nbsp;So
 he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about
 half-past three. &nbsp;I judged he wouldn't come back that night. &nbsp;I
 waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw,
 and went to work on that log again. &nbsp;Before he was t'other side of
 the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the
 water away off yonder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
 shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
 with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. &nbsp;I took all the coffee
 and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took
 the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and
 two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. &nbsp;I took fish-lines
 and matches and other things?everything that was worth a cent.
 &nbsp;I cleaned out the place. &nbsp;I wanted an axe, but there wasn't
 any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to
 leave that. &nbsp;I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
 out so many things. &nbsp;So I fixed that as good as I could from the
 outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness
 and the sawdust. &nbsp;Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place,
 and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was
 bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground. &nbsp;If you stood
 four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never
 notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't
 likely anybody would go fooling around there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. &nbsp;I
 followed around to see. &nbsp;I stood on the bank and looked out over the
 river. &nbsp;All safe. &nbsp;So I took the gun and went up a piece into
 the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig;
 hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the
 prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the axe and smashed in the door. &nbsp;I beat it and hacked it
 considerable a-doing it. &nbsp;I fetched the pig in, and took him back
 nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him
 down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground?hard
 packed, and no boards. &nbsp;Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot
 of big rocks in it?all I could drag?and I started it from the
 pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river
 and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. &nbsp;You could easy see
 that something had been dragged over the ground. &nbsp;I did wish Tom
 Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of
 business, and throw in the fancy touches. &nbsp;Nobody could spread
 himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
 stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. &nbsp;Then I
 took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't
 drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
 river. &nbsp;Now I thought of something else. &nbsp;So I went and got the
 bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the
 house. &nbsp;I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole
 in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on
 the place?pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the
 cooking. &nbsp;Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the
 grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that
 was five mile wide and full of rushes?and ducks too, you might say,
 in the season. &nbsp;There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on
 the other side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go
 to the river. &nbsp;The meal sifted out and made a little track all the
 way to the lake. &nbsp;I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look
 like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack
 with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the
 canoe again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
 willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. &nbsp;I
 made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down
 in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. &nbsp;I says to myself,
 they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
 drag the river for me. &nbsp;And they'll follow that meal track to the
 lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the
 robbers that killed me and took the things. &nbsp;They won't ever hunt the
 river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that,
 and won't bother no more about me. &nbsp;All right; I can stop anywhere I
 want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty
 well, and nobody ever comes there. &nbsp;And then I can paddle over to
 town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's
 Island's the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. &nbsp;When
 I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. &nbsp;I set up and
 looked around, a little scared. &nbsp;Then I remembered. &nbsp;The river
 looked miles and miles across. &nbsp;The moon was so bright I could a
 counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still,
 hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked
 late, and <i>smelt</i> late. You know what I mean?I don't know the words to
 put it in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
 when I heard a sound away over the water. &nbsp;I listened. &nbsp;Pretty
 soon I made it out. &nbsp;It was that dull kind of a regular sound that
 comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. &nbsp;I
 peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was?a skiff,
 away across the water. &nbsp;I couldn't tell how many was in it. &nbsp;It
 kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one
 man in it. &nbsp;Think's I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.
 &nbsp;He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came
 a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a
 reached out the gun and touched him. &nbsp;Well, it <i>was</i> pap, sure enough?and
 sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't lose no time. &nbsp;The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
 soft but quick in the shade of the bank. &nbsp;I made two mile and a half,
 and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the
 river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and
 people might see me and hail me. &nbsp;I got out amongst the driftwood,
 and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 &nbsp;I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe,
 looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. &nbsp;The sky looks ever so
 deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it
 before. &nbsp;And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! &nbsp;I
 heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too?every
 word of it. &nbsp;One man said it was getting towards the long days and
 the short nights now. &nbsp;T'other one said <i>this</i> warn't one of the short
 ones, he reckoned?and then they laughed, and he said it over again,
 and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him,
 and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
 let him alone. &nbsp;The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old
 woman?she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't
 nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was
 nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about
 a week longer. &nbsp;After that the talk got further and further away, and
 I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and
 now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was away below the ferry now. &nbsp;I rose up, and there was Jackson's
 Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing
 up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a
 steamboat without any lights. &nbsp;There warn't any signs of the bar at
 the head?it was all under water now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It didn't take me long to get there. &nbsp;I shot past the head at a
 ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water
 and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. &nbsp;I run the canoe
 into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
 branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
 from the outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out
 on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three
 mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. &nbsp;A
 monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
 with a lantern in the middle of it. &nbsp;I watched it come creeping down,
 and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, "Stern
 oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!" &nbsp;I heard that just as
 plain as if the man was by my side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
 laid down for a nap before breakfast.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
 o'clock. &nbsp;I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
 things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. &nbsp;I
 could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all
 about, and gloomy in there amongst them. &nbsp;There was freckled places
 on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
 freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze
 up there. &nbsp;A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
 very friendly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was powerful lazy and comfortable?didn't want to get up and cook
 breakfast. &nbsp;Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
 sound of "boom!" away up the river. &nbsp;I rouses up, and rests on my
 elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. &nbsp;I hopped up, and
 went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke
 laying on the water a long ways up?about abreast the ferry. &nbsp;And
 there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. &nbsp;I knowed
 what was the matter now. &nbsp;"Boom!" I see the white smoke squirt out of
 the ferryboat's side. &nbsp;You see, they was firing cannon over the
 water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,
 because they might see the smoke. &nbsp;So I set there and watched the
 cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. &nbsp;The river was a mile wide
 there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning?so I was
 having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had
 a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put
 quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go
 right to the drownded carcass and stop there. &nbsp;So, says I, I'll keep
 a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a
 show. &nbsp;I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck
 I could have, and I warn't disappointed. &nbsp;A big double loaf come
 along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she
 floated out further. &nbsp;Of course I was where the current set in the
 closest to the shore?I knowed enough for that. &nbsp;But by and by
 along comes another one, and this time I won. &nbsp;I took out the plug
 and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. &nbsp;It
 was "baker's bread"?what the quality eat; none of your low-down
 corn-pone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
 the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. &nbsp;And
 then something struck me. &nbsp;I says, now I reckon the widow or the
 parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has
 gone and done it. &nbsp;So there ain't no doubt but there is something in
 that thing?that is, there's something in it when a body like the
 widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't
 work for only just the right kind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. &nbsp;The
 ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance
 to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
 close, where the bread did. &nbsp;When she'd got pretty well along down
 towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
 and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. &nbsp;Where
 the log forked I could peep through.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a
 run out a plank and walked ashore. &nbsp;Most everybody was on the boat.
 &nbsp;Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
 Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. &nbsp;Everybody
 was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's
 washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.
 &nbsp;I hope so, anyway."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't hope so. &nbsp;They all crowded up and leaned over the rails,
 nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. &nbsp;I
 could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. &nbsp;Then the
 captain sung out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stand away!" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
 made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I
 judged I was gone. &nbsp;If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd
 a got the corpse they was after. &nbsp;Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks
 to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
 of the island. &nbsp;I could hear the booming now and then, further and
 further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
 &nbsp;The island was three mile long. &nbsp;I judged they had got to the
 foot, and was giving it up. &nbsp;But they didn't yet a while. &nbsp;They
 turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the
 Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.
 &nbsp;I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast
 the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri
 shore and went home to the town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I knowed I was all right now. &nbsp;Nobody else would come a-hunting after
 me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
 woods. &nbsp;I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
 under so the rain couldn't get at them. &nbsp;I catched a catfish and
 haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire
 and had supper. &nbsp;Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
 breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
 satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on
 the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars
 and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain't
 no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you
 soon get over it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so for three days and nights. &nbsp;No difference?just the same
 thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.
 &nbsp;I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to
 know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. &nbsp;I found
 plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
 razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. &nbsp;They
 would all come handy by and by, I judged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far
 from the foot of the island. &nbsp;I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot
 nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.
 About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went
 sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a
 shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the
 ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. &nbsp;I never waited for to look
 further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast
 as ever I could. &nbsp;Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
 thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
 nothing else. &nbsp;I slunk along another piece further, then listened
 again; and so on, and so on. &nbsp;If I see a stump, I took it for a man;
 if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut
 one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand in
 my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. &nbsp;So I
 got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and
 I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
 year's camp, and then clumb a tree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I
 didn't hear nothing?I only <i>thought</i> I heard and seen as much as a
 thousand things. &nbsp;Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last
 I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.
 All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. &nbsp;So when it was good
 and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
 Illinois bank?about a quarter of a mile. &nbsp;I went out in the
 woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay
 there all night when I hear a <i>plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</i>, and says to
 myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. &nbsp;I got
 everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
 through the woods to see what I could find out. &nbsp;I hadn't got far
 when I hear a man say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat
 out. &nbsp;Let's look around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. &nbsp;I tied up in
 the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't sleep much. &nbsp;I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. &nbsp;And
 every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. &nbsp;So the
 sleep didn't do me no good. &nbsp;By and by I says to myself, I can't live
 this way; I'm a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with
 me; I'll find it out or bust. &nbsp;Well, I felt better right off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
 let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. &nbsp;The moon was
 shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
 &nbsp;I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and
 sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the
 island. &nbsp;A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as
 good as saying the night was about done. &nbsp;I give her a turn with the
 paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and
 into the edge of the woods. &nbsp;I sat down there on a log, and looked
 out through the leaves. &nbsp;I see the moon go off watch, and the
 darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale
 streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. &nbsp;So I took
 my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,
 stopping every minute or two to listen. &nbsp;But I hadn't no luck
 somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. &nbsp;But by and by, sure
 enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. &nbsp;I went
 for it, cautious and slow. &nbsp;By and by I was close enough to have a
 look, and there laid a man on the ground. &nbsp;It most give me the
 fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the
 fire. &nbsp;I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
 him, and kept my eyes on him steady. &nbsp;It was getting gray daylight
 now. &nbsp;Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the
 blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! &nbsp;I bet I was glad to see him.
 &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He bounced up and stared at me wild. &nbsp;Then he drops down on his
 knees, and puts his hands together and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doan' hurt me?don't! &nbsp;I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.
 &nbsp;I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. &nbsp;You go
 en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim,
 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. &nbsp;I was ever
 so glad to see Jim. &nbsp;I warn't lonesome now. &nbsp;I told him I warn't
 afraid of <i>him</i> telling the people where I was. &nbsp;I talked along, but he
 only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. &nbsp;Then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's good daylight. &nbsp;Le's get breakfast. &nbsp;Make up your camp
 fire good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?
 But you got a gun, hain't you? &nbsp;Den we kin git sumfn better den
 strawbries."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Strawberries and such truck," I says. &nbsp;"Is that what you live on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I come heah de night arter you's killed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, all that time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?indeedy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah?nuffn else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reck'n I could eat a hoss. &nbsp;I think I could. How long you ben on
 de islan'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Since the night I got killed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! &nbsp;W'y, what has you lived on? &nbsp;But you got a gun. &nbsp;Oh,
 yes, you got a gun. &nbsp;Dat's good. &nbsp;Now you kill sumfn en I'll
 make up de fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a
 grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,
 and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was
 set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with
 witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with
 his knife, and fried him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
 Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. &nbsp;Then
 when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. &nbsp;By and
 by Jim says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it
 warn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. &nbsp;He said
 Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. &nbsp;Then I
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. &nbsp;Then
 he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe I better not tell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, dey's reasons. &nbsp;But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell
 you, would you, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blamed if I would, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. &nbsp;I?<i>I run off</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jim!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But mind, you said you wouldn' tell?you know you said you wouldn'
 tell, Huck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I did. &nbsp;I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. &nbsp;Honest
 <i>injun</i>, I will. &nbsp;People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and
 despise me for keeping mum?but that don't make no difference. &nbsp;I
 ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. &nbsp;So,
 now, le's know all about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see, it 'uz dis way. &nbsp;Ole missus?dat's Miss Watson?she
 pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she
 wouldn' sell me down to Orleans. &nbsp;But I noticed dey wuz a nigger
 trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. &nbsp;Well,
 one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I
 hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but
 she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it
 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'. &nbsp;De widder she try
 to git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.
 &nbsp;I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho'
 som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de
 ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way.
 Well, I wuz dah all night. &nbsp;Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.
 &nbsp;'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight
 er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over
 to de town en say you's killed. &nbsp;Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies
 en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. &nbsp;Sometimes dey'd pull up
 at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
 know all 'bout de killin'. &nbsp;I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck,
 but I ain't no mo' now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I laid dah under de shavin's all day. &nbsp;I 'uz hungry, but I warn't
 afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de
 camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes
 off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de
 place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'. De yuther
 servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de
 ole folks 'uz out'n de way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two
 mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. &nbsp;I'd made up my mine 'bout
 what I's agwyne to do. &nbsp;You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away
 afoot, de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss
 dat skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side,
 en whah to pick up my track. &nbsp;So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it
 doan' <i>make</i> no track.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove' a
 log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in 'mongst
 de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current
 tell de raff come along. &nbsp;Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck
 a-holt. &nbsp;It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while. &nbsp;So
 I clumb up en laid down on de planks. &nbsp;De men 'uz all 'way yonder in
 de middle, whah de lantern wuz. &nbsp;De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a
 good current; so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five
 mile down de river, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho',
 en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I didn' have no luck. &nbsp;When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de
 islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use fer
 to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. &nbsp;Well, I
 had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't?bank too
 bluff. &nbsp;I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good
 place. &nbsp;I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no
 mo', long as dey move de lantern roun' so. &nbsp;I had my pipe en a plug
 er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all
 right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? &nbsp;Why
 didn't you get mud-turkles?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you gwyne to git 'm? &nbsp;You can't slip up on um en grab um; en
 how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? &nbsp;How could a body do it in
 de night? &nbsp;En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's so. &nbsp;You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of
 course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes. &nbsp;I knowed dey was arter you. &nbsp;I see um go by heah?watched
 um thoo de bushes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.
 Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. &nbsp;He said it was a sign
 when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way
 when young birds done it. &nbsp;I was going to catch some of them, but Jim
 wouldn't let me. &nbsp;He said it was death. &nbsp;He said his father laid
 mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said
 his father would die, and he did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for
 dinner, because that would bring bad luck. &nbsp;The same if you shook the
 table-cloth after sundown. &nbsp;And he said if a man owned a beehive and
 that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,
 or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. &nbsp;Jim
 said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had
 tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. &nbsp;Jim
 knowed all kinds of signs. &nbsp;He said he knowed most everything. &nbsp;I
 said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
 him if there warn't any good-luck signs. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mighty few?an' <i>dey</i> ain't no use to a body. &nbsp;What you want to
 know when good luck's a-comin' for? &nbsp;Want to keep it off?" &nbsp;And
 he said: &nbsp;"Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat
 you's agwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase
 it's so fur ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en
 so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign
 dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's de use to ax dat question? &nbsp;Don't you see I has?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, are you rich?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. &nbsp;Wunst I had
 foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you speculate in, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, fust I tackled stock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What kind of stock?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, live stock?cattle, you know. &nbsp;I put ten dollars in a cow.
 &nbsp;But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. &nbsp;De cow up 'n'
 died on my han's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you lost the ten dollars."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I didn't lose it all. &nbsp;I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. &nbsp;I
 sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You had five dollars and ten cents left. &nbsp;Did you speculate any
 more?"
 </p><br>

 <p>
 "Yes. &nbsp;You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto
 Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would
 git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. &nbsp;Well, all de niggers went
 in, but dey didn't have much. &nbsp;I wuz de on'y one dat had much. &nbsp;So
 I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start
 a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de
 business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he
 say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er
 de year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So I done it. &nbsp;Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars
 right off en keep things a-movin'. &nbsp;Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat
 had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it
 off'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de
 year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de
 one-laigged nigger say de bank's busted. &nbsp;So dey didn' none uv us git
 no money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to
 give it to a nigger name' Balum?Balum's Ass dey call him for short;
 he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know. &nbsp;But he's lucky, dey say, en
 I see I warn't lucky. &nbsp;De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en
 he'd make a raise for me. &nbsp;Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he
 wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to
 de Lord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times. &nbsp;So Balum he
 tuck en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to
 come of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what did come of it, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nuffn never come of it. &nbsp;I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no
 way; en Balum he couldn'. &nbsp;I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I
 see de security. &nbsp;Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de
 preacher says! Ef I could git de ten <i>cents</i> back, I'd call it squah, en be
 glad er de chanst."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again
 some time or other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. &nbsp;I owns mysef, en I's wuth

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
 that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
 because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
 high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
 the bushes so thick. &nbsp;We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
 and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side
 towards Illinois. &nbsp;The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
 bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. &nbsp;It was cool
 in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
 didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in
 the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and
 they would never find us without dogs. &nbsp;And, besides, he said them
 little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
 get wet?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and
 lugged all the traps up there. &nbsp;Then we hunted up a place close by to
 hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. &nbsp;We took some fish off
 of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
 side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good
 place to build a fire on. &nbsp;So we built it there and cooked dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
 We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. &nbsp;Pretty
 soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
 right about it. &nbsp;Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all
 fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. &nbsp;It was one of these
 regular summer storms. &nbsp;It would get so dark that it looked all
 blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
 thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
 here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up
 the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
 would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
 was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest
 and blackest?<i>FST</i>!
 it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops
 a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further
 than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd
 hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling,
 grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world,
 like rolling empty barrels down stairs?where it's long stairs and
 they bounce a good deal, you know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jim, this is nice," I says. &nbsp;"I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but
 here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim. &nbsp;You'd a
 ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;
 dat you would, honey. &nbsp;Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so
 do de birds, chile."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last
 it was over the banks. &nbsp;The water was three or four foot deep on the
 island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. &nbsp;On that side it
 was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old
 distance across?a half a mile?because the Missouri shore was
 just a wall of high bluffs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
 and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. &nbsp;We
 went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so
 thick we had to back away and go some other way. &nbsp;Well, on every old
 broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
 when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
 account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
 on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles?they would
 slide off in the water. &nbsp;The ridge our cavern was in was full of
 them. We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft?nice pine
 planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
 and the top stood above water six or seven inches?a solid, level
 floor. &nbsp;We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we
 let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
 daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. &nbsp;She was a
 two-story, and tilted over considerable. &nbsp;We paddled out and got
 aboard?clumb in at an upstairs window. &nbsp;But it was too dark to
 see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. &nbsp;Then
 we looked in at the window. &nbsp;We could make out a bed, and a table,
 and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and
 there was clothes hanging against the wall. &nbsp;There was something
 laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. &nbsp;So Jim
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it didn't budge. &nbsp;So I hollered again, and then Jim says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "De man ain't asleep?he's dead. &nbsp;You hold still?I'll go
 en see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went, and bent down and looked, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a dead man. &nbsp;Yes, indeedy; naked, too. &nbsp;He's ben shot in
 de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. &nbsp;Come in, Huck,
 but doan' look at his face?it's too gashly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't look at him at all. &nbsp;Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
 he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. &nbsp;There was heaps of old
 greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and
 a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the
 ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. &nbsp;There was
 two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's
 underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.
 &nbsp;We put the lot into the canoe?it might come good. &nbsp;There
 was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. &nbsp;And
 there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
 baby to suck. &nbsp;We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. &nbsp;There
 was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. &nbsp;They
 stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.
 &nbsp;The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
 hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a
 bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
 candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
 old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax
 and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some
 nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous
 hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a
 horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them;
 and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he
 found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. &nbsp;The straps was broke
 off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too
 long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other
 one, though we hunted all around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. &nbsp;When we was ready
 to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
 pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with
 the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
 ways off. &nbsp;I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
 most a half a mile doing it. &nbsp;I crept up the dead water under the
 bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. &nbsp;We got home all
 safe.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER X.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
 come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. &nbsp;He said it would fetch
 bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man
 that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that
 was planted and comfortable. &nbsp;That sounded pretty reasonable, so I
 didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing
 I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed
 up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. &nbsp;Jim said he reckoned
 the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the
 money was there they wouldn't a left it. &nbsp;I said I reckoned they
 killed him, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
 snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You
 said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my
 hands. &nbsp;Well, here's your bad luck! &nbsp;We've raked in all this
 truck and eight dollars besides. &nbsp;I wish we could have some bad luck
 like this every day, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never you mind, honey, never you mind. &nbsp;Don't you git too peart.
 &nbsp;It's a-comin'. &nbsp;Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It did come, too. &nbsp;It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. &nbsp;Well,
 after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
 the ridge, and got out of tobacco. &nbsp;I went to the cavern to get some,
 and found a rattlesnake in there. &nbsp;I killed him, and curled him up on
 the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun
 when Jim found him there. &nbsp;Well, by night I forgot all about the
 snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a
 light the snake's mate was there, and bit him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint
 curled up and ready for another spring. &nbsp;I laid him out in a second
 with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. &nbsp;That all
 comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
 dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. &nbsp;Jim told
 me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body
 and roast a piece of it. &nbsp;I done it, and he eat it and said it would
 help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his
 wrist, too. &nbsp;He said that that would help. &nbsp;Then I slid out
 quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't
 going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head
 and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went
 to sucking at the jug again. &nbsp;His foot swelled up pretty big, and so
 did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was
 all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim was laid up for four days and nights. &nbsp;Then the swelling was all
 gone and he was around again. &nbsp;I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take
 a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
 of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. &nbsp;And he
 said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we
 hadn't got to the end of it yet. &nbsp;He said he druther see the new moon
 over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
 snake-skin in his hand. &nbsp;Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
 though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left
 shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.
 &nbsp;Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than
 two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself
 out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid
 him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
 they say, but I didn't see it. &nbsp;Pap told me. &nbsp;But anyway it all
 come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

 <p>
 Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
 again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
 with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
 man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.
 We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.
 &nbsp;We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he
 drownded. &nbsp;We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball,
 and lots of rubbage. &nbsp;We split the ball open with the hatchet, and
 there was a spool in it. &nbsp;Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to
 coat it over so and make a ball of it. &nbsp;It was as big a fish as was
 ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. &nbsp;Jim said he hadn't ever
 seen a bigger one. &nbsp;He would a been worth a good deal over at the
 village. &nbsp;They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the
 market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as
 snow and makes a good fry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
 stirring up some way. &nbsp;I said I reckoned I would slip over the river
 and find out what was going on. &nbsp;Jim liked that notion; but he said I
 must go in the dark and look sharp. &nbsp;Then he studied it over and
 said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
 &nbsp;That was a good notion, too. &nbsp;So we shortened up one of the
 calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.
 &nbsp;Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. &nbsp;I
 put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to
 look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.
 &nbsp;Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. &nbsp;I
 practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I
 could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and
 he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.
 &nbsp;I took notice, and done better.

 <p>
 I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
 the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. &nbsp;I
 tied up and started along the bank. &nbsp;There was a light burning in a
 little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
 who had took up quarters there. &nbsp;I slipped up and peeped in at the
 window. &nbsp;There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
 a candle that was on a pine table. &nbsp;I didn't know her face; she was a
 stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
 &nbsp;Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I
 had come; people might know my voice and find me out. &nbsp;But if this
 woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I
 wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't
 forget I was a girl.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "COME in," says the woman, and I did. &nbsp;She says: &nbsp;"Take a
 cheer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I done it. &nbsp;She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What might your name be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sarah Williams."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where 'bouts do you live? &nbsp;In this neighborhood?'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No'm. &nbsp;In Hookerville, seven mile below. &nbsp;I've walked all the
 way and I'm all tired out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hungry, too, I reckon. &nbsp;I'll find you something."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No'm, I ain't hungry. &nbsp;I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
 here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. &nbsp;It's what makes me so
 late. My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come
 to tell my uncle Abner Moore. &nbsp;He lives at the upper end of the town,
 she says. &nbsp;I hain't ever been here before. &nbsp;Do you know him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; but I don't know everybody yet. &nbsp;I haven't lived here quite two
 weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. &nbsp;You
 better stay here all night. &nbsp;Take off your bonnet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. &nbsp;I ain't
 afeared of the dark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by
 and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me. Then
 she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the
 river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off
 they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake
 coming to our town, instead of letting well alone?and so on and so
 on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
 was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
 murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
 &nbsp;She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars
 (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and
 what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.
 &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who done it? &nbsp;We've heard considerable about these goings on down in
 Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people <i>here</i> that'd like to
 know who killed him. &nbsp;Some think old Finn done it himself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?is that so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Most everybody thought it at first. &nbsp;He'll never know how nigh he
 come to getting lynched. &nbsp;But before night they changed around and
 judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why <i>he</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I stopped. &nbsp;I reckoned I better keep still. &nbsp;She run on, and
 never noticed I had put in at all:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. &nbsp;So there's
 a reward out for him?three hundred dollars. &nbsp;And there's a
 reward out for old Finn, too?two hundred dollars. &nbsp;You see, he
 come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out
 with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.
 &nbsp;Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.
 &nbsp;Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he
 hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done. &nbsp;So
 then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day,
 back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to
 hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and
 that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a
 couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.
 &nbsp;Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back
 till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed
 his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then
 he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
 &nbsp;People do say he warn't any too good to do it. &nbsp;Oh, he's sly, I
 reckon. &nbsp;If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. &nbsp;You
 can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down
 then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I reckon so, 'm. &nbsp;I don't see nothing in the way of it. &nbsp;Has
 everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, not everybody. &nbsp;A good many thinks he done it. &nbsp;But
 they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of
 him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, are they after him yet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you're innocent, ain't you! &nbsp;Does three hundred dollars lay
 around every day for people to pick up? &nbsp;Some folks think the nigger
 ain't far from here. &nbsp;I'm one of them?but I hain't talked it
 around. &nbsp;A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives
 next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever
 goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. &nbsp;Don't
 anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. &nbsp;I didn't say any
 more, but I done some thinking. &nbsp;I was pretty near certain I'd seen
 smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,
 so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway,
 says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. &nbsp;I hain't
 seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but
 husband's going over to see?him and another man. &nbsp;He was gone
 up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got
 here two hours ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. &nbsp;I had to do something with
 my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.
 My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. &nbsp;When the woman
 stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and
 smiling a little. &nbsp;I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be
 interested?and I was, too?and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three hundred dollars is a power of money. &nbsp;I wish my mother could
 get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes. &nbsp;He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get
 a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. &nbsp;They'll go over
 after midnight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. &nbsp;And couldn't the nigger see better, too? &nbsp;After midnight
 he'll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and
 hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't think of that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit
 comfortable. &nbsp;Pretty soon she says,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you say your name was, honey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M?Mary Williams."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't
 look up?seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of
 cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. &nbsp;I wished the
 woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I
 was. &nbsp;But now she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes'm, I did. &nbsp;Sarah Mary Williams. &nbsp;Sarah's my first name.
 &nbsp;Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's the way of it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes'm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. &nbsp;I
 couldn't look up yet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
 they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,
 and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. &nbsp;She was right
 about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
 every little while. &nbsp;She said she had to have things handy to throw
 at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. &nbsp;She
 showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good
 shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and
 didn't know whether she could throw true now. &nbsp;But she watched for a
 chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and
 said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so. &nbsp;Then she told me to try for the
 next one. &nbsp;I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back,
 but of course I didn't let on. &nbsp;I got the thing, and the first rat
 that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a
 been a tolerable sick rat. &nbsp;She said that was first-rate, and she
 reckoned I would hive the next one. &nbsp;She went and got the lump of
 lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she
 wanted me to help her with. &nbsp;I held up my two hands and she put the
 hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters.
 &nbsp;But she broke off to say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep your eye on the rats. &nbsp;You better have the lead in your lap,
 handy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my
 legs together on it and she went on talking. &nbsp;But only about a
 minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and
 very pleasant, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, now, what's your real name?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wh?what, mum?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's your real name? &nbsp;Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob??or what is
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. &nbsp;But
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. &nbsp;If I'm in the
 way here, I'll?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you won't. &nbsp;Set down and stay where you are. &nbsp;I ain't going
 to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. &nbsp;You just tell
 me your secret, and trust me. &nbsp;I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll
 help you. So'll my old man if you want him to. &nbsp;You see, you're a
 runaway 'prentice, that's all. &nbsp;It ain't anything. &nbsp;There ain't
 no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.
 &nbsp;Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. &nbsp;Tell me all about it
 now, that's a good boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would
 just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back
 on her promise. &nbsp;Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and
 the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile
 back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no
 longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance
 and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had
 been three nights coming the thirty miles. &nbsp;I traveled nights, and
 hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home
 lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. &nbsp;I said I believed my
 uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out
 for this town of Goshen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goshen, child? &nbsp;This ain't Goshen. &nbsp;This is St. Petersburg.
 &nbsp;Goshen's ten mile further up the river. &nbsp;Who told you this was
 Goshen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
 into the woods for my regular sleep. &nbsp;He told me when the roads
 forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to
 Goshen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was drunk, I reckon. &nbsp;He told you just exactly wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. &nbsp;I
 got to be moving along. &nbsp;I'll fetch Goshen before daylight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on a minute. &nbsp;I'll put you up a snack to eat. &nbsp;You might
 want it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she put me up a snack, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? &nbsp;Answer
 up prompt now?don't stop to study over it. &nbsp;Which end gets up
 first?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The hind end, mum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, a horse?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The for'rard end, mum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "North side."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with
 their heads pointed the same direction?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The whole fifteen, mum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I reckon you <i>have</i> lived in the country. &nbsp;I thought maybe you
 was trying to hocus me again. &nbsp;What's your real name, now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "George Peters, mum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, try to remember it, George. &nbsp;Don't forget and tell me it's
 Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George Elexander
 when I catch you. &nbsp;And don't go about women in that old calico.
 &nbsp;You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. &nbsp;Bless
 you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread
 still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the
 thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always
 does t'other way. &nbsp;And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch
 yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as
 you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from
 the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl;
 not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.
 &nbsp;And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she
 throws her knees apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when
 you catched the lump of lead. &nbsp;Why, I spotted you for a boy when you
 was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make
 certain. &nbsp;Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George
 Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith
 Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it. &nbsp;Keep
 the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks
 with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition
 when you get to Goshen, I reckon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and
 slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. &nbsp;I
 jumped in, and was off in a hurry. &nbsp;I went up-stream far enough to
 make the head of the island, and then started across. &nbsp;I took off the
 sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. &nbsp;When I was about
 the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
 sound come faint over the water but clear?eleven. &nbsp;When I
 struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most
 winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be,
 and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
 below, as hard as I could go. &nbsp;I landed, and slopped through the
 timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. &nbsp;There Jim laid, sound
 asleep on the ground. &nbsp;I roused him out and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Git up and hump yourself, Jim! &nbsp;There ain't a minute to lose. &nbsp;They're
 after us!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked
 for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. &nbsp;By that
 time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to
 be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. &nbsp;We put out the
 camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside
 after that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but
 if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't
 good to see by. &nbsp;Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in
 the shade, past the foot of the island dead still?never saying a
 word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <p>

 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at
 last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. &nbsp;If a boat was to come
 along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore;
 and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the
 gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. &nbsp;We was in
 ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. &nbsp;It warn't
 good judgment to put <i>everything</i> on the raft.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
 built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. &nbsp;Anyways, they
 stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it
 warn't no fault of mine. &nbsp;I played it as low down on them as I could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
 big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the
 hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had
 been a cave-in in the bank there. &nbsp;A tow-head is a sandbar that has
 cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
 side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
 warn't afraid of anybody running across us. &nbsp;We laid there all day,
 and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
 up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. &nbsp;I told Jim
 all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a
 smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down
 and watch a camp fire?no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. &nbsp;Well, then,
 I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? &nbsp;Jim said
 he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
 believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
 time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
 below the village?no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town
 again. &nbsp;So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get
 us as long as they didn't.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
 cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
 so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
 to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim
 made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level
 of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
 steamboat waves. &nbsp;Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer
 of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold
 it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;
 the wigwam would keep it from being seen. &nbsp;We made an extra
 steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
 something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,
 because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
 coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to
 light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
 "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still
 a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but
 hunted easy water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
 that was making over four mile an hour. &nbsp;We catched fish and talked,
 and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. &nbsp;It was kind
 of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
 up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't
 often that we laughed?only a little kind of a low chuckle. &nbsp;We
 had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
 us at all?that night, nor the next, nor the next.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
 nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. &nbsp;The
 fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
 In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
 people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
 spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. &nbsp;There warn't a
 sound there; everybody was asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little
 village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other
 stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting
 comfortable, and took him along. &nbsp;Pap always said, take a chicken
 when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy
 find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. &nbsp;I never
 see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used
 to say, anyway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
 watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
 that kind. &nbsp;Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you
 was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't
 anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
 &nbsp;Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
 right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
 from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more?then he
 reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. &nbsp;So we talked
 it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up
 our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the
 mushmelons, or what. &nbsp;But towards daylight we got it all settled
 satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. &nbsp;We
 warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.
 &nbsp;I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever
 good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
 didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. &nbsp;Take it all round, we
 lived pretty high.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a
 power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.
 We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the
 lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,
 rocky bluffs on both sides. &nbsp;By and by says I, "Hel-<i>lo</i>, Jim, looky
 yonder!" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. &nbsp;We
 was drifting straight down for her. &nbsp;The lightning showed her very
 distinct. &nbsp;She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
 water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
 chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
 when the flashes come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I
 felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying
 there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. &nbsp;I wanted
 to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was
 there. &nbsp;So I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Le's land on her, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Jim was dead against it at first. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. &nbsp;We's doin' blame'
 well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. &nbsp;Like
 as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to watch but the
 texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his
 life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it's likely
 to break up and wash off down the river any minute?" &nbsp;Jim couldn't
 say nothing to that, so he didn't try. &nbsp;"And besides," I says, "we
 might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. &nbsp;Seegars,
 I bet you?and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. &nbsp;Steamboat
 captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and <i>they</i> don't
 care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. &nbsp;Stick
 a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
 &nbsp;Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? &nbsp;Not for
 pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure?that's what he'd call
 it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. &nbsp;And wouldn't
 he throw style into it??wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?
 &nbsp;Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering
 Kingdom-Come. &nbsp;I wish Tom Sawyer <i>was</i> here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. &nbsp;He said we mustn't talk any
 more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. &nbsp;The lightning
 showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard
 derrick, and made fast there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The deck was high out here. &nbsp;We went sneaking down the slope of it to
 labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
 feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark
 we couldn't see no sign of them. &nbsp;Pretty soon we struck the forward
 end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
 front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
 through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem
 to hear low voices in yonder!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
 along. &nbsp;I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but
 just then I heard a voice wail out and say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another voice said, pretty loud:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie, Jim Turner. &nbsp;You've acted this way before. &nbsp;You
 always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too,
 because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. &nbsp;But this time
 you've said it jest one time too many. &nbsp;You're the meanest,
 treacherousest hound in this country."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By this time Jim was gone for the raft. &nbsp;I was just a-biling with
 curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so
 I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. &nbsp;So I
 dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the
 dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of
 the texas. &nbsp;Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied
 hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim
 lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. &nbsp;This one kept
 pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd <i>like</i> to! &nbsp;And I orter, too?a mean skunk!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, "Oh, please don't, Bill; I
 hain't ever goin' to tell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Deed you <i>ain't!</i> &nbsp;You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet
 you." And once he said: &nbsp;"Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the
 best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. &nbsp;And what <i>for</i>? &nbsp;Jist
 for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our <i>rights</i>?that's what for.
 &nbsp;But I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.
 &nbsp;Put <i>up</i> that pistol, Bill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bill says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to, Jake Packard. &nbsp;I'm for killin' him?and didn't
 he kill old Hatfield jist the same way?and don't he deserve it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I don't <i>want</i> him killed, and I've got my reasons for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! &nbsp;I'll never forgit you
 long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
 and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to
 come. &nbsp;I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
 slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting
 run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. &nbsp;The
 man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom,
 he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here?come in here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in he come, and Bill after him. &nbsp;But before they got in I was up
 in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. &nbsp;Then they stood
 there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. &nbsp;I
 couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd
 been having. &nbsp;I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made
 much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me
 because I didn't breathe. &nbsp;I was too scared. &nbsp;And, besides, a
 body <i>couldn't</i> breathe and hear such talk. &nbsp;They talked low and
 earnest. &nbsp;Bill wanted to kill Turner. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's said he'll tell, and he will. &nbsp;If we was to give both our
 shares to him <i>now</i> it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way
 we've served him. &nbsp;Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence;
 now you hear <i>me</i>. &nbsp;I'm for putting him out of his troubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. &nbsp;Well, then, that's
 all right. &nbsp;Le's go and do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. &nbsp;You listen to me.
 Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's <i>got</i> to be done.
 But what I say is this: &nbsp;it ain't good sense to go court'n around
 after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist
 as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. &nbsp;Ain't
 that so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet it is. &nbsp;But how you goin' to manage it this time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my idea is this: &nbsp;we'll rustle around and gather up whatever
 pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
 the truck. Then we'll wait. &nbsp;Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n
 two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. &nbsp;See?
 He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self.
 &nbsp;I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him. &nbsp;I'm
 unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't
 good sense, it ain't good morals. &nbsp;Ain't I right?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I reck'n you are. &nbsp;But s'pose she <i>don't</i> break up and wash off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, then; come along."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
 forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
 whisper, "Jim!" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
 moan, and I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a
 gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set
 her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck
 there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. &nbsp;But if we find their
 boat we can put <i>all</i> of 'em in a bad fix?for the sheriff 'll get 'em.
 Quick?hurry! &nbsp;I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the
 stabboard. You start at the raft, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my lordy, lordy! &nbsp;<i>raf'</i>? &nbsp;Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done
 broke loose en gone I?en here we is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. &nbsp;Shut up on a wreck with
 such a gang as that! &nbsp;But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.
 &nbsp;We'd <i>got</i> to find that boat now?had to have it for ourselves.
 &nbsp;So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow
 work it was, too?seemed a week before we got to the stern. &nbsp;No
 sign of a boat. &nbsp;Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further?so
 scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said. &nbsp;But I said, come
 on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. &nbsp;So on we
 prowled again. &nbsp;We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it,
 and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter
 to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. &nbsp;When we
 got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!
 &nbsp;I could just barely see her. &nbsp;I felt ever so thankful. &nbsp;In
 another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door
 opened. &nbsp;One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of
 foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set
 down. &nbsp;It was Packard. &nbsp;Then Bill <i>he</i> come out and got in. &nbsp;Packard
 says, in a low voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All ready?shove off!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. &nbsp;But Bill
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on?'d you go through him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. &nbsp;Didn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. &nbsp;So he's got his share o' the cash yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe he won't. &nbsp;But we got to have it anyway. Come along."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they got out and went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
 second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. &nbsp;I out with
 my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
 breathe. &nbsp;We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of
 the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
 hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last
 sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
 show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by
 that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
 understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. &nbsp;Now was
 the first time that I begun to worry about the men?I reckon I hadn't
 had time to before. &nbsp;I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
 murderers, to be in such a fix. &nbsp;I says to myself, there ain't no
 telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I
 like it? &nbsp;So says I to Jim:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it,
 in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then
 I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that
 gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time
 comes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and
 this time worse than ever. &nbsp;The rain poured down, and never a light
 showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. &nbsp;We boomed along down the river,
 watching for lights and watching for our raft. &nbsp;After a long time the
 rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and
 by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. &nbsp;We
 seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. &nbsp;So I said I would
 go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
 there on the wreck. &nbsp;We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I
 told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
 about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and
 shoved for the light. &nbsp;As I got down towards it three or four more
 showed?up on a hillside. &nbsp;It was a village. &nbsp;I closed in
 above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. &nbsp;As I went by
 I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull
 ferryboat. &nbsp;I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering
 whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts
 forward, with his head down between his knees. &nbsp;I gave his shoulder
 two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me
 he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, what's up? &nbsp;Don't cry, bub. &nbsp;What's the trouble?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pap, and mam, and sis, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I broke down. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dang it now, <i>don't</i> take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and
 this 'n 'll come out all right. &nbsp;What's the matter with 'em?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're?they're?are you the watchman of the boat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. &nbsp;"I'm the captain
 and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand;
 and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers. &nbsp;I ain't as rich as old
 Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and
 Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does; but I've told
 him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with him; for, says I, a
 sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if <i>I'd</i> live two mile out
 o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his
 spondulicks and as much more on top of it. &nbsp;Says I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I broke in and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're in an awful peck of trouble, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Who</i> is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your
 ferryboat and go up there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Up where? &nbsp;Where are they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the wreck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What wreck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, there ain't but one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good land! what are they doin' <i>there</i>, for gracious sakes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I bet they didn't! &nbsp;Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for
 'em if they don't git off mighty quick! &nbsp;Why, how in the nation did
 they ever git into such a scrape?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Easy enough. &nbsp;Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Booth's Landing?go on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of the
 evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay
 all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember
 her name?and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went
 a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the
 wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost,
 but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. &nbsp;Well,
 about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it
 was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so <i>we</i>
 saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple?and oh, he
 <i>was</i> the best cretur!?I most wish 't it had been me, I do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My George! &nbsp;It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. &nbsp;And <i>then</i>
 what did you all do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make
 nobody hear. &nbsp;So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
 somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and
 Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and hunt up
 her uncle, and he'd fix the thing. &nbsp;I made the land about a mile
 below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do
 something, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current? There
 ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.' &nbsp;Now if you'll go and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By Jackson, I'd <i>like</i> to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but who
 in the dingnation's a-going' to <i>pay</i> for it? &nbsp;Do you reckon your pap?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why <i>that's</i> all right. &nbsp;Miss Hooker she tole me, <i>particular</i>, that her
 uncle Hornback?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Great guns! is <i>he</i> her uncle? &nbsp;Looky here, you break for that light
 over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter
 of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim
 Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. &nbsp;And don't you fool around any,
 because he'll want to know the news. &nbsp;Tell him I'll have his niece
 all safe before he can get to town. &nbsp;Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going
 up around the corner here to roust out my engineer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
 and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the
 easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some
 woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start.
 But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of
 taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.
 &nbsp;I wished the widow knowed about it. &nbsp;I judged she would be
 proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead
 beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.

 <p>
 Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down!
 A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her.
 &nbsp;She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance
 for anybody being alive in her. &nbsp;I pulled all around her and hollered
 a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. &nbsp;I felt a
 little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if
 they could stand it I could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on
 a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid
 on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for
 Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her uncle
 Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up
 and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down
 the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when it
 did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. &nbsp;By the time I
 got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
 struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in
 and slept like dead people.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off
 of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of
 other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of
 seegars. &nbsp;We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our
 lives. &nbsp;The seegars was prime. &nbsp;We laid off all the afternoon in
 the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
 time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
 ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he
 didn't want no more adventures. &nbsp;He said that when I went in the
 texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly
 died, because he judged it was all up with <i>him</i> anyway it could be fixed;
 for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved,
 whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and
 then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. &nbsp;Well, he was right; he
 was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
 how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
 other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead
 of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. &nbsp;He
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn' know dey was so many un um. &nbsp;I hain't hearn 'bout none un
 um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in
 a pack er k'yards. &nbsp;How much do a king git?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get?" &nbsp;I says; "why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they
 want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to
 them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Ain'</i> dat gay? &nbsp;En what dey got to do, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>They</i> don't do nothing! &nbsp;Why, how you talk! They just set around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; is dat so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course it is. &nbsp;They just set around?except, maybe, when
 there's a war; then they go to the war. &nbsp;But other times they just
 lazy around; or go hawking?just hawking and sp?Sh!?d'
 you hear a noise?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a
 steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," says I, "and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the
 parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.
 But mostly they hang round the harem."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Roun' de which?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Harem."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's de harem?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The place where he keeps his wives. &nbsp;Don't you know about the harem?
 Solomon had one; he had about a million wives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, yes, dat's so; I?I'd done forgot it. &nbsp;A harem's a
 bo'd'n-house, I reck'n. &nbsp;Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de
 nussery. &nbsp;En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de
 racket. &nbsp;Yit dey say Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. &nbsp;I
 doan' take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in
 de mids' er sich a blim-blammin' all de time? &nbsp;No?'deed he
 wouldn't. &nbsp;A wise man 'ud take en buil' a biler-factry; en den he
 could shet <i>down</i> de biler-factry when he want to res'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, but he <i>was</i> the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told me
 so, her own self."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I doan k'yer what de widder say, he <i>warn't</i> no wise man nuther. &nbsp;He
 had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. &nbsp;Does you know 'bout
 dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, the widow told me all about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Well</i>, den! &nbsp;Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? &nbsp;You
 jes' take en look at it a minute. &nbsp;Dah's de stump, dah?dat's
 one er de women; heah's you?dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en
 dish yer dollar bill's de chile. &nbsp;Bofe un you claims it. &nbsp;What
 does I do? &nbsp;Does I shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which
 un you de bill <i>do</i> b'long to, en han' it over to de right one, all safe en
 soun', de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would? &nbsp;No; I take en
 whack de bill in <i>two</i>, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de
 yuther woman. &nbsp;Dat's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.
 &nbsp;Now I want to ast you: &nbsp;what's de use er dat half a bill??can't
 buy noth'n wid it. &nbsp;En what use is a half a chile? &nbsp;I wouldn'
 give a dern for a million un um."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point?blame it, you've
 missed it a thousand mile."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who? &nbsp;Me? &nbsp;Go 'long. &nbsp;Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints.
 &nbsp;I reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich
 doin's as dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout
 a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole
 chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain.
 &nbsp;Doan' talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I tell you you don't get the point."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blame de point! &nbsp;I reck'n I knows what I knows. &nbsp;En mine you,
 de <i>real</i> pint is down furder?it's down deeper. &nbsp;It lays in de
 way Sollermun was raised. &nbsp;You take a man dat's got on'y one or two
 chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen? &nbsp;No, he ain't; he
 can't 'ford it. &nbsp;<i>He</i> know how to value 'em. &nbsp;But you take a man
 dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's
 diffunt. &nbsp;<i>He</i> as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'.
 &nbsp;A chile er two, mo' er less, warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad
 fatch him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never see such a nigger. &nbsp;If he got a notion in his head once,
 there warn't no getting it out again. &nbsp;He was the most down on
 Solomon of any nigger I ever see. &nbsp;So I went to talking about other
 kings, and let Solomon slide. &nbsp;I told about Louis Sixteenth that got
 his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his little boy the
 dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail,
 and some say he died there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Po' little chap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But some says he got out and got away, and come to America."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dat's good! &nbsp;But he'll be pooty lonesome?dey ain' no kings
 here, is dey, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Den he cain't git no situation. &nbsp;What he gwyne to do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't know. &nbsp;Some of them gets on the police, and some of
 them learns people how to talk French."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>No</i>, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said?not a single
 word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I be ding-busted! &nbsp;How do dat come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know; but it's so. &nbsp;I got some of their jabber out of a
 book. S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy?what
 would you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head?dat is,
 if he warn't white. &nbsp;I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. &nbsp;It's only saying, do you
 know how to talk French?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, why couldn't he <i>say</i> it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, he <i>is</i> a-saying it. &nbsp;That's a Frenchman's <i>way</i> of saying it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout
 it. &nbsp;Dey ain' no sense in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, a cat don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, does a cow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, a cow don't, nuther."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, dey don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from
 <i>us</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, mos' sholy it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a <i>Frenchman</i> to talk
 different from us? &nbsp;You answer me that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is a cat a man, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. &nbsp;Is a cow
 a man??er is a cow a cat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, she ain't either of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the
 yuther of 'em. &nbsp;Is a Frenchman a man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Well</i>, den! &nbsp;Dad blame it, why doan' he <i>talk</i> like a man? &nbsp;You
 answer me <i>dat</i>!"
 </p><br>

 I see it warn't no use wasting words?you can't learn a nigger to
 argue. So I quit.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of
 Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after.
 &nbsp;We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio
 amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
 to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
 ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything but
 little saplings to tie to. &nbsp;I passed the line around one of them
 right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the
 raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she
 went. &nbsp;I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared
 I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me?and then
 there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. &nbsp;I
 jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
 and set her back a stroke. &nbsp;But she didn't come. &nbsp;I was in such
 a hurry I hadn't untied her. &nbsp;I got up and tried to untie her, but I
 was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
 down the towhead. &nbsp;That was all right as far as it went, but the
 towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I
 shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was
 going than a dead man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank or a
 towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's mighty
 fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. &nbsp;I
 whooped and listened. &nbsp;Away down there somewheres I hears a small
 whoop, and up comes my spirits. &nbsp;I went tearing after it, listening
 sharp to hear it again. &nbsp;The next time it come I see I warn't heading
 for it, but heading away to the right of it. &nbsp;And the next time I was
 heading away to the left of it?and not gaining on it much either,
 for I was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going
 straight ahead all the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
 time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
 that was making the trouble for me. &nbsp;Well, I fought along, and
 directly I hears the whoop <i>behind</i> me. &nbsp;I was tangled good now. &nbsp;That
 was somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I throwed the paddle down. &nbsp;I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
 yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
 place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
 and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I was
 all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. &nbsp;I
 couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look
 natural nor sound natural in a fog.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut
 bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off
 to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the
 currrent was tearing by them so swift.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In another second or two it was solid white and still again. &nbsp;I set
 perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't
 draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I just give up then. &nbsp;I knowed what the matter was. &nbsp;That cut
 bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. &nbsp;It
 warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. &nbsp;It had the
 big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and
 more than half a mile wide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. &nbsp;I
 was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't
 ever think of that. &nbsp;No, you <i>feel</i> like you are laying dead still on
 the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to
 yourself how fast <i>you're</i> going, but you catch your breath and think, my!
 how that snag's tearing along. &nbsp;If you think it ain't dismal and
 lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once?you'll
 see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the
 answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do it, and
 directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim
 glimpses of them on both sides of me?sometimes just a narrow channel
 between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear
 the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung
 over the banks. &nbsp;Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst
 the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway,
 because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern. &nbsp;You never
 knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep
 from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must
 be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further
 ahead and clear out of hearing?it was floating a little faster than
 what I was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't
 hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. &nbsp;I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
 snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. &nbsp;I was good and tired, so I
 laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. &nbsp;I didn't
 want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it; so
 I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was
 shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend
 stern first. &nbsp;First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was
 dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up
 dim out of last week.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind
 of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the
 stars. &nbsp;I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
 water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a
 couple of sawlogs made fast together. &nbsp;Then I see another speck, and
 chased that; then another, and this time I was right. &nbsp;It was the
 raft.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
 knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. &nbsp;The
 other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
 branches and dirt. &nbsp;So she'd had a rough time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to gap,
 and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? &nbsp;Why didn't you stir me up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? &nbsp;En you ain' dead?you
 ain' drownded?you's back agin? &nbsp;It's too good for true, honey,
 it's too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. &nbsp;No,
 you ain' dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck?de
 same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter with you, Jim? &nbsp;You been a-drinking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drinkin'? &nbsp;Has I ben a-drinkin'? &nbsp;Has I had a chance to be
 a-drinkin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How does I talk wild?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>How</i>? &nbsp;Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all
 that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huck?Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. &nbsp;<i>Hain't</i>
 you ben gone away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gone away? &nbsp;Why, what in the nation do you mean? &nbsp;I hain't been
 gone anywheres. &nbsp;Where would I go to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is. &nbsp;Is I <i>me</i>, or who
 <i>is</i> I? Is I heah, or whah <i>is</i> I? &nbsp;Now dat's what I wants to know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a
 tangle-headed old fool, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I is, is I? &nbsp;Well, you answer me dis: &nbsp;Didn't you tote out de
 line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I didn't. &nbsp;What tow-head? &nbsp;I hain't see no tow-head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You hain't seen no towhead? &nbsp;Looky here, didn't de line pull loose
 en de raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in
 de fog?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What fog?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, de fog!?de fog dat's been aroun' all night. &nbsp;En didn't
 you whoop, en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un
 us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know
 whah he wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a
 turrible time en mos' git drownded? &nbsp;Now ain' dat so, boss?ain't
 it so? &nbsp;You answer me dat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, this is too many for me, Jim. &nbsp;I hain't seen no fog, nor no
 islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. &nbsp;I been setting here talking
 with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I
 reckon I done the same. &nbsp;You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of
 course you've been dreaming."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it
 happen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it. I
 know, because I've been here all the time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over
 it. &nbsp;Then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't de
 powerfullest dream I ever see. &nbsp;En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'
 dat's tired me like dis one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like
 everything sometimes. &nbsp;But this one was a staving dream; tell me all
 about it, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it
 happened, only he painted it up considerable. &nbsp;Then he said he must
 start in and "'terpret" it, because it was sent for a warning. &nbsp;He
 said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good,
 but the current was another man that would get us away from him. &nbsp;The
 whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we
 didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into
 bad luck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. &nbsp;The lot of towheads was
 troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of
 mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and
 aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the
 big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more
 trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was
 clearing up again now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim," I
 says; "but what does <i>these</i> things stand for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. &nbsp;You
 could see them first-rate now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
 again. &nbsp;He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
 couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
 again right away. &nbsp;But when he did get the thing straightened around
 he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do dey stan' for? &nbsp;I'se gwyne to tell you. &nbsp;When I got all
 wore out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart
 wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what become
 er me en de raf'. &nbsp;En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe
 en soun', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo'
 foot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could
 make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. &nbsp;Dat truck dah is <i>trash</i>; en trash
 is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em
 ashamed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
 saying anything but that. &nbsp;But that was enough. &nbsp;It made me feel
 so mean I could almost kissed <i>his</i> foot to get him to take it back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
 myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it
 afterwards, neither. &nbsp;I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I
 wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way.

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
 monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. &nbsp;She
 had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as
 thirty men, likely. &nbsp;She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and
 an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. &nbsp;There
 was a power of style about her. &nbsp;It <i>amounted</i> to something being a
 raftsman on such a craft as that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
 hot. &nbsp;The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
 both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. &nbsp;We
 talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
 it. &nbsp;I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't
 but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit
 up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? &nbsp;Jim said if the
 two big rivers joined together there, that would show. &nbsp;But I said
 maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into
 the same old river again. That disturbed Jim?and me too. &nbsp;So
 the question was, what to do? &nbsp;I said, paddle ashore the first time a
 light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a
 trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how
 far it was to Cairo. &nbsp;Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a
 smoke on it and waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not
 pass it without seeing it. &nbsp;He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,
 because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he'd
 be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. &nbsp;Every
 little while he jumps up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dah she is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it warn't. &nbsp;It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
 down again, and went to watching, same as before. &nbsp;Jim said it made
 him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. &nbsp;Well, I
 can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
 because I begun to get it through my head that he <i>was</i> most free?and
 who was to blame for it? &nbsp;Why, <i>me</i>. &nbsp;I couldn't get that out of
 my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't
 rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. &nbsp;It hadn't ever come home
 to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. &nbsp;But now it did;
 and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. &nbsp;I tried to
 make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off
 from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says,
 every time, "But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could
 a paddled ashore and told somebody." &nbsp;That was so?I couldn't
 get around that noway. &nbsp;That was where it pinched. &nbsp;Conscience
 says to me, "What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her
 nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? &nbsp;What
 did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? &nbsp;Why,
 she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she
 tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. &nbsp;<i>That's</i> what she
 done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. &nbsp;I
 fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
 fidgeting up and down past me. &nbsp;We neither of us could keep still.
 &nbsp;Every time he danced around and says, "Dah's Cairo!" it went through
 me like a shot, and I thought if it <i>was</i> Cairo I reckoned I would die of
 miserableness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. &nbsp;He
 was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
 would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got
 enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where
 Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children,
 and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go
 and steal them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It most froze me to hear such talk. &nbsp;He wouldn't ever dared to talk
 such talk in his life before. &nbsp;Just see what a difference it made in
 him the minute he judged he was about free. &nbsp;It was according to the
 old saying, "Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell." &nbsp;Thinks I,
 this is what comes of my not thinking. &nbsp;Here was this nigger, which I
 had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying
 he would steal his children?children that belonged to a man I didn't
 even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. &nbsp;My
 conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to
 it, "Let up on me?it ain't too late yet?I'll paddle ashore at
 the first light and tell." &nbsp;I felt easy and happy and light as a
 feather right off. &nbsp;All my troubles was gone. &nbsp;I went to looking
 out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. &nbsp;By and by one
 showed. &nbsp;Jim sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We's safe, Huck, we's safe! &nbsp;Jump up and crack yo' heels! &nbsp;Dat's
 de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. &nbsp;It mightn't be, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for
 me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on accounts
 o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for
 Huck; Huck done it. &nbsp;Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes'
 fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de <i>only</i> fren' ole Jim's got now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this,
 it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. &nbsp;I went along slow
 then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started or
 whether I warn't. &nbsp;When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his
 promise to ole Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I just felt sick. &nbsp;But I says, I <i>got</i> to do it?I can't get
 <i>out</i> of it. &nbsp;Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with
 guns, and they stopped and I stopped. &nbsp;One of them says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that yonder?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A piece of a raft," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you belong on it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any men on it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only one, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of
 the bend. &nbsp;Is your man white or black?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't answer up prompt. &nbsp;I tried to, but the words wouldn't come.
 I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man
 enough?hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. &nbsp;I see I was weakening; so
 I just give up trying, and up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's white."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish you would," says I, "because it's pap that's there, and maybe
 you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. &nbsp;He's sick?and
 so is mam and Mary Ann."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. &nbsp;But I s'pose we've got to.
 &nbsp;Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. &nbsp;When we had made
 a stroke or two, I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. &nbsp;Everybody
 goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do
 it by myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's infernal mean. &nbsp;Odd, too. &nbsp;Say, boy, what's the
 matter with your father?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the?a?the?well, it ain't anything much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stopped pulling. &nbsp;It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft
 now. One says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy, that's a lie. &nbsp;What <i>is</i> the matter with your pap? &nbsp;Answer
 up square now, and it'll be the better for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will, sir, I will, honest?but don't leave us, please. &nbsp;It's
 the?the?Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave
 you the headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft?please do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Set her back, John, set her back!" says one. &nbsp;They backed water.
 &nbsp;"Keep away, boy?keep to looard. &nbsp;Confound it, I just
 expect the wind has blowed it to us. &nbsp;Your pap's got the small-pox,
 and you know it precious well. &nbsp;Why didn't you come out and say so?
 &nbsp;Do you want to spread it all over?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," says I, a-blubbering, "I've told everybody before, and they just
 went away and left us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor devil, there's something in that. &nbsp;We are right down sorry for
 you, but we?well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see.
 &nbsp;Look here, I'll tell you what to do. &nbsp;Don't you try to land by
 yourself, or you'll smash everything to pieces. &nbsp;You float along down
 about twenty miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the
 river. &nbsp;It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help
 you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. &nbsp;Don't
 be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. &nbsp;Now we're
 trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us,
 that's a good boy. &nbsp;It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the
 light is?it's only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor,
 and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck. &nbsp;Here, I'll put a
 twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by.
 &nbsp;I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool
 with small-pox, don't you see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on, Parker," says the other man, "here's a twenty to put on the
 board for me. &nbsp;Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and
 you'll be all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's so, my boy?good-bye, good-bye. &nbsp;If you see any runaway
 niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, sir," says I; "I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I
 can help it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
 knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to
 try to learn to do right; a body that don't get <i>started</i> right when he's
 little ain't got no show?when the pinch comes there ain't nothing to
 back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. &nbsp;Then I
 thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right
 and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? &nbsp;No,
 says I, I'd feel bad?I'd feel just the same way I do now. &nbsp;Well,
 then, says I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's
 troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is
 just the same? &nbsp;I was stuck. &nbsp;I couldn't answer that. &nbsp;So I
 reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do
 whichever come handiest at the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. &nbsp;I looked all around; he
 warn't anywhere. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jim!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here I is, Huck. &nbsp;Is dey out o' sight yit? &nbsp;Don't talk loud."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. &nbsp;I
 told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne
 to shove for sho' if dey come aboard. &nbsp;Den I was gwyne to swim to de
 raf' agin when dey was gone. &nbsp;But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck!
 &nbsp;Dat <i>wuz</i> de smartes' dodge! &nbsp;I tell you, chile, I'spec it save'
 ole Jim?ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then we talked about the money. &nbsp;It was a pretty good raise?twenty
 dollars apiece. &nbsp;Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
 now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
 States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he
 wished we was already there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
 the raft good. &nbsp;Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
 getting all ready to quit rafting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in
 a left-hand bend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went off in the canoe to ask about it. &nbsp;Pretty soon I found a man
 out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. &nbsp;I ranged up and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mister, is that town Cairo?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cairo? no. &nbsp;You must be a blame' fool."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What town is it, mister?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you want to know, go and find out. &nbsp;If you stay here botherin'
 around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't
 want."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I paddled to the raft. &nbsp;Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
 mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it
 was high ground, so I didn't go. &nbsp;No high ground about Cairo, Jim
 said. I had forgot it. &nbsp;We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
 close to the left-hand bank. &nbsp;I begun to suspicion something. &nbsp;So
 did Jim. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. &nbsp;Po' niggers can't have no luck.
 &nbsp;I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim?I do wish I'd never laid
 eyes on it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. &nbsp;Don't you blame yo'self
 'bout it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough,
 and outside was the old regular Muddy! &nbsp;So it was all up with Cairo.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We talked it all over. &nbsp;It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we
 couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course. &nbsp;There warn't no way
 but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.
 &nbsp;So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be
 fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe
 was gone!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We didn't say a word for a good while. &nbsp;There warn't anything to say.
 &nbsp;We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
 rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? &nbsp;It would
 only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
 bad luck?and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
 still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no way
 but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a
 canoe to go back in. &nbsp;We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't
 anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we shoved out after dark on the raft.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a
 snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
 now if they read on and see what more it done for us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. &nbsp;But we
 didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
 more. &nbsp;Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
 meanest thing to fog. &nbsp;You can't tell the shape of the river, and you
 can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along
 comes a steamboat up the river. &nbsp;We lit the lantern, and judged she
 would see it. &nbsp;Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they
 go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
 nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she was
 close. &nbsp;She aimed right for us. &nbsp;Often they do that and try to
 see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites
 off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
 he's mighty smart. &nbsp;Well, here she comes, and we said she was going
 to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. &nbsp;She
 was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
 cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
 out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
 like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over
 us. &nbsp;There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
 engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam?and as Jim went
 overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
 through the raft.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I dived?and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
 had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. &nbsp;I
 could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under
 a minute and a half. &nbsp;Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I
 was nearly busting. &nbsp;I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water
 out of my nose, and puffed a bit. &nbsp;Of course there was a booming
 current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds
 after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she
 was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though
 I could hear her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I
 grabbed a plank that touched me while I was "treading water," and struck
 out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. &nbsp;But I made out to see that
 the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that
 I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
 long time in getting over. &nbsp;I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
 bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough
 ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big
 old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. &nbsp;I was going to
 rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and
 barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head
 out, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be done, boys! &nbsp;Who's there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "George Jackson, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want nothing, sir. &nbsp;I only want to go along by, but the dogs
 won't let me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you prowling around here this time of night for?hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you did, did you? &nbsp;Strike a light there, somebody. &nbsp;What
 did you say your name was?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "George Jackson, sir. &nbsp;I'm only a boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid?nobody'll
 hurt you. &nbsp;But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. &nbsp;Rouse
 out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. &nbsp;George Jackson, is
 there anybody with you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir, nobody."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The
 man sung out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool?ain't you got any
 sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. &nbsp;Bob, if you and
 Tom are ready, take your places."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir; I never heard of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. &nbsp;Now, all ready. &nbsp;Step
 forward, George Jackson. &nbsp;And mind, don't you hurry?come mighty
 slow. &nbsp;If there's anybody with you, let him keep back?if he
 shows himself he'll be shot. Come along now. &nbsp;Come slow; push the
 door open yourself?just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. &nbsp;I took one slow step
 at a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
 &nbsp;The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little
 behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking
 and unbarring and unbolting. &nbsp;I put my hand on the door and pushed it
 a little and a little more till somebody said, "There, that's enough?put
 your head in." I done it, but I judged they would take it off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me
 at them, for about a quarter of a minute: &nbsp;Three big men with guns
 pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about
 sixty, the other two thirty or more?all of them fine and handsome?and
 the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I
 couldn't see right well. &nbsp;The old gentleman says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There; I reckon it's all right. &nbsp;Come in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and
 bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all
 went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got
 together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows?there
 warn't none on the side. &nbsp;They held the candle, and took a good look
 at me, and all said, "Why, <i>he</i> ain't a Shepherdson?no, there ain't
 any Shepherdson about him." &nbsp;Then the old man said he hoped I
 wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by
 it?it was only to make sure. &nbsp;So he didn't pry into my pockets,
 but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. &nbsp;He
 told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but
 the old lady says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't you
 reckon it may be he's hungry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True for you, Rachel?I forgot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the old lady says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Betsy" (this was a nigger woman), "you fly around and get him something
 to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
 up Buck and tell him?oh, here he is himself. &nbsp;Buck, take this
 little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in
 some of yours that's dry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck looked about as old as me?thirteen or fourteen or along there,
 though he was a little bigger than me. &nbsp;He hadn't on anything but a
 shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. &nbsp;He came in gaping and digging
 one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other
 one. He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They all laughed, and Bob says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in
 coming."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I
 don't get no show."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man, "you'll have show enough,
 all in good time, don't you fret about that. &nbsp;Go 'long with you now,
 and do as your mother told you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
 roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. &nbsp;While I was at it he
 asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell
 me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day
 before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went
 out. &nbsp;I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, guess," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I never heard tell of it before?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you can guess, can't you? &nbsp;It's just as easy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Which</i> candle?" &nbsp;I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, any candle," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know where he was," says I; "where was he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, he was in the <i>dark</i>! &nbsp;That's where he was!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? &nbsp;Say, how long are you
 going to stay here? &nbsp;You got to stay always. &nbsp;We can just have
 booming times?they don't have no school now. &nbsp;Do you own a dog?
 &nbsp;I've got a dog?and he'll go in the river and bring out chips
 that you throw in. &nbsp;Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind
 of foolishness? &nbsp;You bet I don't, but ma she makes me. &nbsp;Confound
 these ole britches! &nbsp;I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther
 not, it's so warm. &nbsp;Are you all ready? All right. &nbsp;Come along,
 old hoss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk?that is what
 they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've
 come across yet. &nbsp;Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
 except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. &nbsp;They
 all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. &nbsp;The young women had
 quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. &nbsp;They all asked
 me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
 on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
 run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to
 hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then
 there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down
 to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there
 was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river,
 deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here.
 &nbsp;So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it.
 &nbsp;Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to
 bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had
 forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think,
 and when Buck waked up I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you spell, Buck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I bet you can't spell my name," says I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I bet you what you dare I can," says he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," says I, "go ahead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n?there now," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't think you could. &nbsp;It ain't
 no slouch of a name to spell?right off without studying."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I set it down, private, because somebody might want <i>me</i> to spell it next,
 and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. &nbsp;I hadn't
 seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
 style. &nbsp;It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden
 one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses
 in town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
 of parlors in towns has beds in them. &nbsp;There was a big fireplace that
 was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
 pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
 they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
 same as they do in town. &nbsp;They had big brass dog-irons that could
 hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece,
 with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front,
 and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
 pendulum swinging behind it. &nbsp;It was beautiful to hear that clock
 tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured
 her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
 and fifty before she got tuckered out. &nbsp;They wouldn't took any money
 for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made
 out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. &nbsp;By one of the
 parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and
 when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths
 nor look different nor interested. &nbsp;They squeaked through underneath.
 &nbsp;There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind
 those things. &nbsp;On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a
 lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes
 piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real
 ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got
 chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue
 spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. &nbsp;It come
 all the way from Philadelphia, they said. &nbsp;There was some books, too,
 piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. &nbsp;One was a big
 family Bible full of pictures. &nbsp;One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a
 man that left his family, it didn't say why. &nbsp;I read considerable in
 it now and then. &nbsp;The statements was interesting, but tough. &nbsp;Another
 was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I
 didn't read the poetry. &nbsp;Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and
 another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to
 do if a body was sick or dead. &nbsp;There was a hymn book, and a lot of
 other books. &nbsp;And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly
 sound, too?not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old
 basket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had pictures hung on the walls?mainly Washingtons and
 Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called "Signing the
 Declaration." There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
 daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years
 old. &nbsp;They was different from any pictures I ever see before?blacker,
 mostly, than is common. &nbsp;One was a woman in a slim black dress,
 belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle
 of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil,
 and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black
 slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her
 right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her
 side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the
 picture it said "Shall I Never See Thee More Alas." &nbsp;Another one was
 a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head,
 and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying
 into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other
 hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said "I Shall Never
 Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas." &nbsp;There was one where a young lady
 was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks;
 and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on
 one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against
 her mouth, and underneath the picture it said "And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou
 Art Gone Alas." &nbsp;These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't
 somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they
 always give me the fan-tods. &nbsp;Everybody was sorry she died, because
 she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see
 by what she had done what they had lost. &nbsp;But I reckoned that with
 her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. &nbsp;She
 was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick,
 and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till
 she got it done, but she never got the chance. &nbsp;It was a picture of a
 young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all
 ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the
 moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded
 across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more
 reaching up towards the moon?and the idea was to see which pair
 would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was
 saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this
 picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday
 come they hung flowers on it. &nbsp;Other times it was hid with a little
 curtain. &nbsp;The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet
 face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to
 me.

 This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
 obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
 Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It
 was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of
 Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D
 </p><br>
 <div class="poem">
 <p style="text-indent:0%;">
 And did young Stephen sicken,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And did young Stephen
 die?<br> And did the sad hearts thicken,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And did the
 mourners cry?<br> <br> No; such was not the fate of<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Young
 Stephen Dowling Bots;<br> Though sad hearts round him thickened,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;'Twas not from sickness' shots.<br> <br> No
 whooping-cough did rack his frame,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor measles drear
 with spots;<br> Not these impaired the sacred name<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Of
 Stephen Dowling Bots.<br> <br> Despised love struck not with woe<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;That head of curly knots,<br> Nor stomach troubles laid
 him low,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Young Stephen Dowling Bots.<br> <br> O no.
 Then list with tearful eye,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst I his fate do tell.<br>
 His soul did from this cold world fly<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;By falling down
 a well.<br> <br> They got him out and emptied him;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas

 If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
 fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by. &nbsp;Buck
 said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. &nbsp;She didn't ever have
 to stop to think. &nbsp;He said she would slap down a line, and if she
 couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap
 down another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write
 about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was
 sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would
 be on hand with her "tribute" before he was cold. &nbsp;She called them
 tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then
 the undertaker?the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but
 once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which
 was Whistler. &nbsp;She warn't ever the same after that; she never
 complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. &nbsp;Poor
 thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to
 be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her
 pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. &nbsp;I
 liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything
 come between us. &nbsp;Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people
 when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to
 make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or
 two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. &nbsp;They kept
 Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way
 she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
 &nbsp;The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
 of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
 mostly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
 the windows: &nbsp;white, with pictures painted on them of castles with
 vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. &nbsp;There was
 a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing
 was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing "The Last Link is
 Broken" and play "The Battle of Prague" on it. &nbsp;The walls of all the
 rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole
 house was whitewashed on the outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and
 floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day,
 and it was a cool, comfortable place. &nbsp;Nothing couldn't be better.
 &nbsp;And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 COL. &nbsp;Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. &nbsp;He was a gentleman
 all over; and so was his family. &nbsp;He was well born, as the saying is,
 and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow
 Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
 in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more
 quality than a mudcat himself. &nbsp;Col. &nbsp;Grangerford was very tall
 and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
 anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
 he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a
 high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep
 back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you
 may say. &nbsp;His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight
 and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of
 his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made
 out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he
 wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. &nbsp;He carried a
 mahogany cane with a silver head to it. &nbsp;There warn't no
 frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. &nbsp;He was
 as kind as he could be?you could feel that, you know, and so you had
 confidence. &nbsp;Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
 straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
 flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and
 find out what the matter was afterwards. &nbsp;He didn't ever have to tell
 anybody to mind their manners?everybody was always good-mannered
 where he was. &nbsp;Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was
 sunshine most always?I mean he made it seem like good weather.
 &nbsp;When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute,
 and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up
 out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again till
 they had set down. &nbsp;Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the
 decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he
 held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then
 they bowed and said, "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;" and <i>they</i> bowed the
 least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three,
 and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of
 whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me
 and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bob was the oldest and Tom next?tall, beautiful men with very broad
 shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. &nbsp;They
 dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore
 broad Panama hats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and
 grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but when
 she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her
 father. &nbsp;She was beautiful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. &nbsp;She was
 gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each person had their own nigger to wait on them?Buck too. &nbsp;My
 nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody
 do anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more?three
 sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
 Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
 fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
 round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
 daytimes, and balls at the house nights. &nbsp;These people was mostly
 kinfolks of the family. &nbsp;The men brought their guns with them. &nbsp;It
 was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was another clan of aristocracy around there?five or six
 families?mostly of the name of Shepherdson. &nbsp;They was as
 high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.
 &nbsp;The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing,
 which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up
 there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons
 there on their fine horses.

 One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
 coming. &nbsp;We was crossing the road. &nbsp;Buck says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick! &nbsp;Jump for the woods!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. &nbsp;Pretty
 soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse
 easy and looking like a soldier. &nbsp;He had his gun across his pommel.
 &nbsp;I had seen him before. &nbsp;It was young Harney Shepherdson. &nbsp;I
 heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his
 head. &nbsp;He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
 hid. &nbsp;But we didn't wait. &nbsp;We started through the woods on a
 run. &nbsp;The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge
 the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he
 rode away the way he come?to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't
 see. &nbsp;We never stopped running till we got home. &nbsp;The old
 gentleman's eyes blazed a minute?'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged?then
 his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't like that shooting from behind a bush. &nbsp;Why didn't you step
 into the road, my boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Shepherdsons don't, father. &nbsp;They always take advantage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
 his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. &nbsp;The two
 young men looked dark, but never said nothing. &nbsp;Miss Sophia she
 turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
 ourselves, I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you want to kill him, Buck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I bet I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did he do to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Him? &nbsp;He never done nothing to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, nothing?only it's on account of the feud."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's a feud?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, where was you raised? &nbsp;Don't you know what a feud is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never heard of it before?tell me about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," says Buck, "a feud is this way: &nbsp;A man has a quarrel with
 another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills <i>him</i>; then
 the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the <i>cousins</i>
 chip in?and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't no
 more feud. &nbsp;But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has this one been going on long, Buck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I should <i>reckon</i>! &nbsp;It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along
 there. &nbsp;There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to
 settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot
 the man that won the suit?which he would naturally do, of course.
 &nbsp;Anybody would."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was the trouble about, Buck??land?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon maybe?I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, who done the shooting? &nbsp;Was it a Grangerford or a
 Shepherdson?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laws, how do I know? &nbsp;It was so long ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't anybody know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
 don't know now what the row was about in the first place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has there been many killed, Buck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; right smart chance of funerals. &nbsp;But they don't always kill.
 &nbsp;Pa's got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't
 weigh much, anyway. &nbsp;Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and
 Tom's been hurt once or twice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; we got one and they got one. &nbsp;'Bout three months ago my cousin
 Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side of
 the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'
 foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him,
 and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in his
 hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping off
 and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it,
 nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time;
 so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced around so
 as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up
 and shot him down. &nbsp;But he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck,
 for inside of a week our folks laid <i>him</i> out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon he <i>warn't</i> a coward. &nbsp;Not by a blame' sight. &nbsp;There
 ain't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons?not a one. &nbsp;And there
 ain't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. &nbsp;Why, that old man
 kep' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three
 Grangerfords, and come out winner. &nbsp;They was all a-horseback; he lit
 off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse
 before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their
 horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he
 peppered away at them. &nbsp;Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky
 and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be <i>fetched</i> home?and one of
 'em was dead, and another died the next day. &nbsp;No, sir; if a body's
 out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst them
 Shepherdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that <i>kind</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
 a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them
 between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. &nbsp;The
 Shepherdsons done the same. &nbsp;It was pretty ornery preaching?all
 about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it
 was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a
 powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
 preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me to
 be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
 chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. &nbsp;Buck
 and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. &nbsp;I
 went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. &nbsp;I found
 that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and
 she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I
 liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for
 her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. &nbsp;Then she said she'd
 forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other
 books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and
 not say nothing to nobody. &nbsp;I said I would. So I slid out and slipped
 off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a
 hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a
 puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool. &nbsp;If you notice, most
 folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in
 such a sweat about a Testament. &nbsp;So I give it a shake, and out drops
 a little piece of paper with "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote on it with a pencil.
 &nbsp;I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. &nbsp;I couldn't
 make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when
 I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.
 &nbsp;She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament
 till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
 before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I
 was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. &nbsp;She was
 mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made
 her powerful pretty. &nbsp;I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my
 breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had
 read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I
 told her "no, only coarse-hand," and then she said the paper warn't
 anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I
 noticed that my nigger was following along behind. &nbsp;When we was out
 of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
 a-running, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole stack
 o' water-moccasins."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday. &nbsp;He oughter
 know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
 them. What is he up to, anyway? &nbsp;So I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right; trot ahead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
 ankle deep as much as another half-mile. &nbsp;We come to a little flat
 piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and
 vines, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.
 I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
 him. &nbsp;I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
 as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
 there asleep?and, by jings, it was my old Jim!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
 to see me again, but it warn't. &nbsp;He nearly cried he was so glad, but
 he warn't surprised. &nbsp;Said he swum along behind me that night, and
 heard me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody
 to pick <i>him</i> up and take him into slavery again. &nbsp;Says he:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways
 behine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch up
 wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat house
 I begin to go slow. &nbsp;I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you?I
 wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed you's in de
 house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. &nbsp;Early in de
 mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey tuk me
 en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accounts o' de
 water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how you's
 a-gitt'n along."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn?but
 we's all right now. &nbsp;I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got
 a chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>What</i> raft, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Our ole raf'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, she warn't. &nbsp;She was tore up a good deal?one en' of her
 was; but dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'.
 &nbsp;Ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night
 hadn' ben so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as
 de sayin' is, we'd a seed de raf'. &nbsp;But it's jis' as well we didn't,
 'kase now she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new
 lot o' stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim?did you catch
 her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? &nbsp;No; some er de
 niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her
 in a crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un
 'um she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups
 en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but
 to you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's
 propaty, en git a hid'n for it? &nbsp;Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en
 dey 'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en
 make 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I
 wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey. &nbsp;Dat
 Jack's a good nigger, en pooty smart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he is. &nbsp;He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come,
 and he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins. &nbsp;If anything happens <i>he</i>
 ain't mixed up in it. &nbsp;He can say he never seen us together, and it
 'll be the truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I don't want to talk much about the next day. &nbsp;I reckon I'll cut it
 pretty short. &nbsp;I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over
 and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was?didn't seem to
 be anybody stirring. &nbsp;That warn't usual. &nbsp;Next I noticed that
 Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs?nobody
 around; everything as still as a mouse. &nbsp;Just the same outside.
 &nbsp;Thinks I, what does it mean? &nbsp;Down by the wood-pile I comes
 across my Jack, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's it all about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says he:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you know, Mars Jawge?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," says I, "I don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. &nbsp;She run off in de
 night some time?nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get married
 to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know?leastways, so dey 'spec.
 &nbsp;De fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour ago?maybe a little
 mo'?en' I <i>tell</i> you dey warn't no time los'. &nbsp;Sich another
 hurryin' up guns en hosses <i>you</i> never see! &nbsp;De women folks has gone
 for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en
 rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo'
 he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. &nbsp;I reck'n dey's gwyne to
 be mighty rough times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buck went off 'thout waking me up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I reck'n he <i>did</i>! &nbsp;Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it. &nbsp;Mars
 Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson
 or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en you bet you he'll
 fetch one ef he gits a chanst."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took up the river road as hard as I could put. &nbsp;By and by I begin
 to hear guns a good ways off. &nbsp;When I come in sight of the log store
 and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
 and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks
 of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. &nbsp;There was a
 wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
 was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
 place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a
 couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
 steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it. &nbsp;Every time one of them
 showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. &nbsp;The
 two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
 both ways.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. &nbsp;They started
 riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
 bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. &nbsp;All
 the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to
 carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run.
 &nbsp;They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then
 the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.
 &nbsp;They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had too
 good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and
 slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of
 the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen
 years old.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. &nbsp;As soon as they
 was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. &nbsp;He didn't know
 what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. &nbsp;He was
 awful surprised. &nbsp;He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when
 the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other?wouldn't
 be gone long. &nbsp;I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn't come
 down. &nbsp;Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and his cousin
 Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. &nbsp;He
 said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the
 enemy. &nbsp;Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. &nbsp;Buck
 said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations?the
 Shepherdsons was too strong for them. &nbsp;I asked him what was become of
 young Harney and Miss Sophia. &nbsp;He said they'd got across the river
 and was safe. &nbsp;I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on
 because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him?I
 hain't ever heard anything like it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns?the men
 had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
 horses! &nbsp;The boys jumped for the river?both of them hurt?and
 as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them
 and singing out, "Kill them, kill them!" &nbsp;It made me so sick I most
 fell out of the tree. &nbsp;I ain't a-going to tell <i>all</i> that happened?it
 would make me sick again if I was to do that. &nbsp;I wished I hadn't ever
 come ashore that night to see such things. &nbsp;I ain't ever going to get
 shut of them?lots of times I dream about them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
 Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
 gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
 trouble was still a-going on. &nbsp;I was mighty downhearted; so I made up
 my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I
 was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
 Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I
 judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she
 acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
 wouldn't ever happened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece,
 and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at
 them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away
 as quick as I could. &nbsp;I cried a little when I was covering up Buck's
 face, for he was mighty good to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was just dark now. &nbsp;I never went near the house, but struck
 through the woods and made for the swamp. &nbsp;Jim warn't on his island,
 so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the
 willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. &nbsp;The
 raft was gone! &nbsp;My souls, but I was scared! &nbsp;I couldn't get my
 breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. &nbsp;A voice not
 twenty-five foot from me says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good lan'! is dat you, honey? &nbsp;Doan' make no noise."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Jim's voice?nothing ever sounded so good before. &nbsp;I run
 along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged
 me, he was so glad to see me. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin. &nbsp;Jack's
 been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no
 mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de
 crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes
 agin en tells me for certain you <i>is</i> dead. &nbsp;Lawsy, I's mighty glad to
 git you back again, honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think
 I've been killed, and floated down the river?there's something up
 there that 'll help them think so?so don't you lose no time, Jim,
 but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
 middle of the Mississippi. &nbsp;Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
 judged that we was free and safe once more. &nbsp;I hadn't had a bite to
 eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
 and pork and cabbage and greens?there ain't nothing in the world so
 good when it's cooked right?and whilst I eat my supper we talked and
 had a good time. &nbsp;I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and
 so was Jim to get away from the swamp. &nbsp;We said there warn't no home
 like a raft, after all. &nbsp;Other places do seem so cramped up and
 smothery, but a raft don't. &nbsp;You feel mighty free and easy and
 comfortable on a raft.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
 they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. &nbsp;Here is the way we
 put in the time. &nbsp;It was a monstrous big river down there?sometimes
 a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon
 as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up?nearly
 always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods
 and willows, and hid the raft with them. &nbsp;Then we set out the lines.
 &nbsp;Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and
 cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about
 knee deep, and watched the daylight come. &nbsp;Not a sound anywheres?perfectly
 still?just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the
 bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. &nbsp;The first thing to see, looking away
 over the water, was a kind of dull line?that was the woods on
 t'other side; you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the
 sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away
 off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
 drifting along ever so far away?trading scows, and such things; and
 long black streaks?rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep
 screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far;
 and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the
 look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which
 breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist
 curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you
 make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other
 side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so
 you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up,
 and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to
 smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
 because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do
 get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling
 in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of
 the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. &nbsp;And afterwards we would watch
 the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy
 off to sleep. &nbsp;Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
 maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
 other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a
 stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be
 nothing to hear nor nothing to see?just solid lonesomeness. &nbsp;Next
 you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
 chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the
 axe flash and come down?you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go
 up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the
 <i>k'chunk</i>!?it had took all that time to come over the water. &nbsp;So
 we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.
 &nbsp;Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by
 was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. &nbsp;A
 scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
 laughing?heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it
 made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
 &nbsp;Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
 middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her
 to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked
 about all kinds of things?we was always naked, day and night,
 whenever the mosquitoes would let us?the new clothes Buck's folks
 made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much
 on clothes, nohow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
 time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a
 spark?which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the
 water you could see a spark or two?on a raft or a scow, you know;
 and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them
 crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. &nbsp;We had the sky up there, all
 speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them,
 and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. &nbsp;Jim
 he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
 have took too long to <i>make</i> so many. &nbsp;Jim said the moon could a <i>laid</i>
 them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing
 against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
 could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
 streak down. &nbsp;Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the
 nest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
 dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of
 her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
 pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her
 powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves
 would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a
 bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how
 long, except maybe frogs or something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three
 hours the shores was black?no more sparks in the cabin windows.
 &nbsp;These sparks was our clock?the first one that showed again
 meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right
 away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the
 main shore?it was only two hundred yards?and paddled about a
 mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some
 berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
 the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they
 could foot it. &nbsp;I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
 after anybody I judged it was <i>me</i>?or maybe Jim. &nbsp;I was about to
 dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and
 sung out and begged me to save their lives?said they hadn't been
 doing nothing, and was being chased for it?said there was men and
 dogs a-coming. &nbsp;They wanted to jump right in, but I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you do it. &nbsp;I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got
 time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then
 you take to the water and wade down to me and get in?that'll throw
 the dogs off the scent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and
 in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
 shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't see
 them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got further
 and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at all; by the
 time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river,
 everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the
 cottonwoods and was safe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and
 very gray whiskers. &nbsp;He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a
 greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into
 his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses?no, he only had one. &nbsp;He
 had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
 his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. &nbsp;After
 breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
 was that these chaps didn't know one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What got you into trouble?" says the baldhead to t'other chap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth?and
 it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it?but I
 stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of
 sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you
 told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. &nbsp;So I
 told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out <i>with</i> you.
 That's the whole yarn?what's yourn?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week,
 and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it
 mighty warm for the rummies, I <i>tell</i> you, and takin' as much as five or six
 dollars a night?ten cents a head, children and niggers free?and
 business a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report
 got around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a
 private jug on the sly. &nbsp;A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and
 told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses,
 and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,
 and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar and
 feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. &nbsp;I didn't wait for no
 breakfast?I warn't hungry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Old man," said the young one, "I reckon we might double-team it together;
 what do you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ain't undisposed. &nbsp;What's your line?mainly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines; theater-actor?tragedy,
 you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there's a chance;
 teach singing-geography school for a change; sling a lecture sometimes?oh,
 I do lots of things?most anything that comes handy, so it ain't
 work. &nbsp;What's your lay?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. &nbsp;Layin' on o'
 hands is my best holt?for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and
 I k'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find out
 the facts for me. &nbsp;Preachin's my line, too, and workin'
 camp-meetin's, and missionaryin' around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What 're you alassin' about?" says the bald-head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded
 down into such company." &nbsp;And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye
 with a rag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?" says the
 baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it <i>is</i> good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who fetched
 me so low when I was so high? &nbsp;I did myself. &nbsp;I don't blame <i>you</i>,
 gentlemen?far from it; I don't blame anybody. &nbsp;I deserve it
 all. &nbsp;Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know?there's
 a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done,
 and take everything from me?loved ones, property, everything; but it
 can't take that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my
 poor broken heart will be at rest." &nbsp;He went on a-wiping.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drot your pore broken heart," says the baldhead; "what are you heaving
 your pore broken heart at <i>us</i> f'r? &nbsp;<i>we</i> hain't done nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I know you haven't. &nbsp;I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. &nbsp;I
 brought myself down?yes, I did it myself. &nbsp;It's right I should
 suffer?perfectly right?I don't make any moan."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Brought you down from whar? &nbsp;Whar was you brought down from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes?let it pass?'tis
 no matter. &nbsp;The secret of my birth?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The secret of your birth! &nbsp;Do you mean to say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," says the young man, very solemn, "I will reveal it to you,
 for I feel I may have confidence in you. &nbsp;By rights I am a duke!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then
 the baldhead says: &nbsp;"No! you can't mean it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. &nbsp;My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater,
 fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the
 pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
 dying about the same time. &nbsp;The second son of the late duke seized
 the titles and estates?the infant real duke was ignored. &nbsp;I am
 the lineal descendant of that infant?I am the rightful Duke of
 Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of
 men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded
 to the companionship of felons on a raft!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he
 said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we was a
 mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything
 else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. &nbsp;He said we ought
 to bow when we spoke to him, and say "Your Grace," or "My Lord," or "Your
 Lordship"?and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain
 "Bridgewater," which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one
 of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he
 wanted done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, that was all easy, so we done it. &nbsp;All through dinner Jim stood
 around and waited on him, and says, "Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or
 some o' dat?" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the old man got pretty silent by and by?didn't have much to say,
 and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
 around that duke. &nbsp;He seemed to have something on his mind. &nbsp;So,
 along in the afternoon, he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here, Bilgewater," he says, "I'm nation sorry for you, but you
 ain't the only person that's had troubles like that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No you ain't. &nbsp;You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down
 wrongfully out'n a high place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth." &nbsp;And,
 by jings, <i>he</i> begins to cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold! &nbsp;What do you mean?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bilgewater, kin I trust you?" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the bitter death!" &nbsp;He took the old man by the hand and squeezed
 it, and says, "That secret of your being: &nbsp;speak!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. &nbsp;Then the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, my friend, it is too true?your eyes is lookin' at this very
 moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy
 the Sixteen and Marry Antonette."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You! &nbsp;At your age! &nbsp;No! &nbsp;You mean you're the late
 Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very
 least."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung
 these gray hairs and this premature balditude. &nbsp;Yes, gentlemen, you
 see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,
 trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to
 do, we was so sorry?and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.
 &nbsp;So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to
 comfort <i>him</i>. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done
 with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
 easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
 rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
 "Your Majesty," and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down in
 his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and
 doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he told us
 we might set down. &nbsp;This done him heaps of good, and so he got
 cheerful and comfortable. &nbsp;But the duke kind of soured on him, and
 didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king
 acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's great-grandfather and
 all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by <i>his</i>
 father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke
 stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft,
 Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour? &nbsp;It 'll only
 make things oncomfortable. &nbsp;It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,
 it ain't your fault you warn't born a king?so what's the use to
 worry? &nbsp;Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I?that's
 my motto. &nbsp;This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here?plenty
 grub and an easy life?come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be
 friends."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. &nbsp;It took
 away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it
 would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft;
 for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be
 satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no kings
 nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. &nbsp;But I never
 said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way; then you
 don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble. &nbsp;If they
 wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as
 it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so I
 didn't tell him. &nbsp;If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
 that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have
 their own way.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered
 up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running?was
 Jim a runaway nigger? &nbsp;Says I:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run <i>south</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No, they allowed he wouldn't. &nbsp;I had to account for things some way,
 so I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
 they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. &nbsp;Pa, he 'lowed
 he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little
 one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. &nbsp;Pa was
 pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't
 nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. &nbsp;That warn't
 enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
 &nbsp;Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he
 ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on
 it. &nbsp;Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard
 corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the
 wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only
 four years old, so they never come up no more. &nbsp;Well, for the next
 day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming
 out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he
 was a runaway nigger. &nbsp;We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they
 don't bother us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
 want to. &nbsp;I'll think the thing over?I'll invent a plan that'll
 fix it. We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to
 go by that town yonder in daylight?it mightn't be healthy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning
 was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to
 shiver?it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that.
 &nbsp;So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what
 the beds was like. &nbsp;My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's, which
 was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick,
 and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks
 sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a
 rustling that you wake up. &nbsp;Well, the duke allowed he would take my
 bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a
 corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on. &nbsp;Your Grace 'll
 take the shuck bed yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going
 to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
 oppression. &nbsp;Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
 submit; 'tis my fate. &nbsp;I am alone in the world?let me suffer;
 can bear it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We got away as soon as it was good and dark. &nbsp;The king told us to
 stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till
 we got a long ways below the town. &nbsp;We come in sight of the little
 bunch of lights by and by?that was the town, you know?and slid
 by, about a half a mile out, all right. &nbsp;When we was three-quarters
 of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it
 come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the
 king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him
 and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. &nbsp;It
 was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd
 had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the
 week, not by a long sight. &nbsp;My souls, how the wind did scream along!
 &nbsp;And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the
 white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking
 dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then
 comes a H-WHACK!?bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum?and
 the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit?and then
 RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager. &nbsp;The waves most
 washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't
 mind. &nbsp;We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was
 glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty
 soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so
 Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
 mighty good that way, Jim was. &nbsp;I crawled into the wigwam, but the
 king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show
 for me; so I laid outside?I didn't mind the rain, because it was
 warm, and the waves warn't running so high now. &nbsp;About two they come
 up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind,
 because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
 mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular
 ripper and washed me overboard. &nbsp;It most killed Jim a-laughing.
 &nbsp;He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the
 storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I
 rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and
 the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. &nbsp;Then they got
 tired of it, and allowed they would "lay out a campaign," as they called
 it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little
 printed bills and read them out loud. &nbsp;One bill said, "The celebrated
 Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris," would "lecture on the Science of
 Phrenology" at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten
 cents admission, and "furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents
 apiece." &nbsp;The duke said that was <i>him</i>. &nbsp;In another bill he was
 the "world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury
 Lane, London." &nbsp;In other bills he had a lot of other names and done
 other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a "divining-rod,"
 "dissipating witch spells," and so on. &nbsp;By and by he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the histrionic muse is the darling. &nbsp;Have you ever trod the
 boards, Royalty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," says the king.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur," says
 the duke. &nbsp;"The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do
 the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
 How does that strike you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you
 see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much of
 it. &nbsp;I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. &nbsp;Do
 you reckon you can learn me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Easy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. &nbsp;I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. &nbsp;Le's
 commence right away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
 said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
 whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.
 Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the difference
 in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she
 goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap.
 &nbsp;Here are the costumes for the parts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil
 armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white cotton
 nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. &nbsp;The king was satisfied;
 so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid
 spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how
 it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to
 get his part by heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
 after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
 in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go
 down to the town and fix that thing. &nbsp;The king allowed he would go,
 too, and see if he couldn't strike something. &nbsp;We was out of coffee,
 so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and
 perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. &nbsp;We found a sick nigger
 sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too
 young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back
 in the woods. &nbsp;The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and
 work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. &nbsp;We found it;
 a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop?carpenters and
 printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. &nbsp;It was a
 dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures
 of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. &nbsp;The duke
 shed his coat and said he was all right now. &nbsp;So me and the king lit
 out for the camp-meeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
 awful hot day. &nbsp;There was as much as a thousand people there from
 twenty mile around. &nbsp;The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
 everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the
 flies. &nbsp;There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
 branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
 watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
 bigger and held crowds of people. &nbsp;The benches was made out of
 outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks
 into for legs. They didn't have no backs. &nbsp;The preachers had high
 platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. &nbsp;The women had on
 sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a
 few of the young ones had on calico. &nbsp;Some of the young men was
 barefooted, and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a
 tow-linen shirt. &nbsp;Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the
 young folks was courting on the sly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. &nbsp;He
 lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear
 it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
 he lined out two more for them to sing?and so on. &nbsp;The people
 woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end
 some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. &nbsp;Then the preacher
 begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one
 side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the
 front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting
 his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
 his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
 that, shouting, "It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! &nbsp;Look
 upon it and live!" &nbsp;And people would shout out, "Glory!?A-a-<i>men</i>!"
 &nbsp;And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying
 amen:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (<i>Amen</i>!) come, sick
 and sore! (<i>Amen</i>!) come, lame and halt and blind! (<i>Amen</i>!) come, pore and
 needy, sunk in shame! (<i>A-A-Men</i>!) come, all that's worn and soiled and
 suffering!?come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart!
 come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the
 door of heaven stands open?oh, enter in and be at rest!" (<i>A-A-Men</i>!
 &nbsp;<i>Glory, Glory Hallelujah!</i>)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so on. &nbsp;You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on
 account of the shouting and crying. &nbsp;Folks got up everywheres in the
 crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench,
 with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got
 up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung
 themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over
 everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the
 preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. &nbsp;He
 told them he was a pirate?been a pirate for thirty years out in the
 Indian Ocean?and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring
 in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
 goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
 without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
 ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the
 first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start right
 off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his
 life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it
 better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that
 ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there without
 money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he
 would say to him, "Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it all
 belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers
 and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest
 friend a pirate ever had!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. &nbsp;Then somebody
 sings out, "Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!" &nbsp;Well,
 a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, "Let <i>him</i> pass
 the hat around!" &nbsp;Then everybody said it, the preacher too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and
 blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good
 to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest
 kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask
 him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done
 it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times?and
 he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their
 houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this was the
 last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in
 a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the
 pirates.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
 collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. &nbsp;And then he
 had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
 wagon when he was starting home through the woods. &nbsp;The king said,
 take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the
 missionarying line. &nbsp;He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't
 amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke was thinking <i>he'd</i> been doing pretty well till the king come to
 show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. &nbsp;He had set up
 and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office?horse
 bills?and took the money, four dollars. &nbsp;And he had got in ten
 dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put
 in for four dollars if they would pay in advance?so they done it.
 The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three
 subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in
 advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he
 said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as
 he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. &nbsp;He set up a
 little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head?three
 verses?kind of sweet and saddish?the name of it was, "Yes,
 crush, cold world, this breaking heart"?and he left that all set up
 and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. &nbsp;Well,
 he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square
 day's work for it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for,
 because it was for us. &nbsp;It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a
 bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and "$200 reward" under it. &nbsp;The
 reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. &nbsp;It said
 he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
 last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
 him back he could have the reward and expenses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want
 to. &nbsp;Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with
 a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
 captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so
 we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to
 get the reward. &nbsp;Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,
 but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. &nbsp;Too much
 like jewelry. &nbsp;Ropes are the correct thing?we must preserve the
 unities, as we say on the boards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble
 about running daytimes. &nbsp;We judged we could make miles enough that
 night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in
 the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
 boom right along if we wanted to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock;
 then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't hoist our
 lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," I says, "I reckon not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," says he, "dat's all right, den. &nbsp;I doan' mine one er two
 kings, but dat's enough. &nbsp;Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain'
 much better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
 what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had
 so much trouble, he'd forgot it.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up. &nbsp;The
 king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
 they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal.
 After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft, and
 pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle
 in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to
 getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. &nbsp;When he had got it pretty
 good him and the duke begun to practice it together. &nbsp;The duke had to
 learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
 sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done it
 pretty well; "only," he says, "you mustn't bellow out <i>Romeo</i>! that way,
 like a bull?you must say it soft and sick and languishy, so?R-o-o-meo!
 that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you
 know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of
 oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight?the duke called
 himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft
 was grand to see. &nbsp;But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard,
 and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of
 adventures they'd had in other times along the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After dinner the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I
 guess we'll add a little more to it. &nbsp;We want a little something to
 answer encores with, anyway."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's onkores, Bilgewater?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke told him, and then says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; and you?well,
 let me see?oh, I've got it?you can do Hamlet's soliloquy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hamlet's which?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
 Ah, it's sublime, sublime! &nbsp;Always fetches the house. &nbsp;I haven't
 got it in the book?I've only got one volume?but I reckon I can
 piece it out from memory. &nbsp;I'll just walk up and down a minute, and
 see if I can call it back from recollection's vaults."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every
 now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze
 his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would
 sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear. &nbsp;It was beautiful to see
 him. By and by he got it. &nbsp;He told us to give attention. &nbsp;Then
 he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
 arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
 and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all
 through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
 chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
 &nbsp;This is the speech?I learned it, easy enough, while he was
 learning it to the king:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>

 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin
 That makes calamity of so long life;
 For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,
 But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep,
 Great nature's second course,
 And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune
 Than fly to others that we know not of.
 There's the respect must give us pause:
 Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
 The law's delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take.
 In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn
 In customary suits of solemn black,
 But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
 Breathes forth contagion on the world,
 And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage,
 Is sicklied o'er with care.
 And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops,
 With this regard their currents turn awry,
 And lose the name of action.
 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
 But soft you, the fair Ophelia:
 Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws.
 But get thee to a nunnery?go!
</pre>
 <p>
 Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
 could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
 he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
 would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
 after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most
 uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting and
 rehearsing?as the duke called it?going on all the time. One
 morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in
 sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
 three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut
 in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the
 canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for
 our show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
 afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all
 kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave before
 night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the
 court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They read like
 this:

 <p>
 Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
 old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they
 was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
 reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little
 gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them
 but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots
 and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The
 fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different
 times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn't generly
 have but one hinge?a leather one. Some of the fences had been
 whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus's
 time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people
 driving them out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the stores was along one street. &nbsp;They had white domestic awnings
 in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
 There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on
 them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing
 tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching?a mighty ornery lot.
 They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but
 didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and
 Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used
 considerable many cuss words. &nbsp;There was as many as one loafer
 leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in
 his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
 tobacco or scratch. &nbsp;What a body was hearing amongst them all the
 time was:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. &nbsp;Ask Bill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got none.
 Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of
 tobacco of their own. &nbsp;They get all their chawing by borrowing; they
 say to a fellow, "I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute
 give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had"?which is a lie pretty much
 everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no
 stranger, so he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>You</i> give him a chaw, did you? &nbsp;So did your sister's cat's
 grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me,
 Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge
 you no back intrust, nuther."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I <i>did</i> pay you back some of it wunst."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you did?'bout six chaws. &nbsp;You borry'd store tobacker and
 paid back nigger-head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
 natural leaf twisted. &nbsp;When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut
 it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw
 with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in
 two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it
 when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, gimme the <i>chaw</i>, and you take the <i>plug</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else <i>but</i> mud?mud
 as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or
 three inches deep in <i>all</i> the places. &nbsp;The hogs loafed and grunted
 around everywheres. &nbsp;You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come
 lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where
 folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and
 wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she
 was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, "Hi! &nbsp;<i>so</i>
 boy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible,
 with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more
 a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the
 thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise.
 &nbsp;Then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight. &nbsp;There
 couldn't anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over,
 like a dog fight?unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray
 dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him
 run himself to death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and
 they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in, The people had
 moved out of them. &nbsp;The bank was caved away under one corner of some
 others, and that corner was hanging over. &nbsp;People lived in them yet,
 but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a
 house caves in at a time. &nbsp;Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a
 mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves
 into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving
 back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons
 and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. &nbsp;Families
 fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the
 wagons. &nbsp;There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen
 three fights. &nbsp;By and by somebody sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here comes old Boggs!?in from the country for his little old
 monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of
 Boggs. &nbsp;One of them says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. &nbsp;If he'd a-chawed up
 all the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have
 considerable ruputation now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know I
 warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
 Injun, and singing out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cler the track, thar. &nbsp;I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins
 is a-gwyne to raise."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old,
 and had a very red face. &nbsp;Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
 and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and lay
 them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because he'd
 come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat first,
 and spoon vittles to top off on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He see me, and rode up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whar'd you come f'm, boy? &nbsp;You prepared to die?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he rode on. &nbsp;I was scared, but a man says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's
 drunk. &nbsp;He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw?never
 hurt nobody, drunk nor sober."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so
 he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.
 You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to,
 and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going
 on. &nbsp;By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five?and he was
 a heap the best dressed man in that town, too?steps out of the
 store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. &nbsp;He
 says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow?he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. &nbsp;Till one
 o'clock, mind?no longer. &nbsp;If you open your mouth against me
 only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he turns and goes in. &nbsp;The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
 stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. &nbsp;Boggs rode off
 blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and
 pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up.
 &nbsp;Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he
 wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes,
 and so he <i>must</i> go home?he must go right away. &nbsp;But it didn't do
 no good. &nbsp;He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
 in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
 the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a
 chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could
 lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use?up the street he
 would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. &nbsp;By and by
 somebody says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go for his daughter!?quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll
 listen to her. &nbsp;If anybody can persuade him, she can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So somebody started on a run. &nbsp;I walked down street a ways and
 stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on
 his horse. &nbsp;He was a-reeling across the street towards me,
 bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and
 hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging
 back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. &nbsp;Somebody sings
 out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boggs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn.
 He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in
 his right hand?not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel
 tilted up towards the sky. &nbsp;The same second I see a young girl coming
 on the run, and two men with her. &nbsp;Boggs and the men turned round to
 see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one
 side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level?both
 barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, "O Lord, don't
 shoot!" &nbsp;Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at
 the air?bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards on to
 the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. &nbsp;That young
 girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
 father, crying, and saying, "Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!" &nbsp;The
 crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
 their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
 shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him air, give him air!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around
 on his heels and walked off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the
 same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at
 the window, where I was close to him and could see in. &nbsp;They laid him
 on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another
 one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I
 seen where one of the bullets went in. &nbsp;He made about a dozen long
 gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and
 letting it down again when he breathed it out?and after that he laid
 still; he was dead. &nbsp;Then they pulled his daughter away from him,
 screaming and crying, and took her off. &nbsp;She was about sixteen, and
 very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
 pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that
 had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying all
 the time, "Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and
 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a
 chance; other folks has their rights as well as you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there
 was going to be trouble. &nbsp;The streets was full, and everybody was
 excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and
 there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching
 their necks and listening. &nbsp;One long, lanky man, with long hair and a
 big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled
 cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where
 Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to
 t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show
 they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their
 thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then
 he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and
 having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, "Boggs!" and then
 fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says "Bang!" staggered
 backwards, says "Bang!" again, and fell down flat on his back. The people
 that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly
 the way it all happened. &nbsp;Then as much as a dozen people got out
 their bottles and treated him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. &nbsp;In about
 a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
 snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.
 </p><br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like
 Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to
 mush, and it was awful to see. &nbsp;Children was heeling it ahead of the
 mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
 the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every
 tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the
 mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
 reach. &nbsp;Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
 most to death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam
 together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise. &nbsp;It was
 a little twenty-foot yard. &nbsp;Some sung out "Tear down the fence! tear
 down the fence!" &nbsp;Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and
 smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to
 roll in like a wave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
 with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm
 and deliberate, not saying a word. &nbsp;The racket stopped, and the wave
 sucked back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sherburn never said a word?just stood there, looking down. &nbsp;The
 stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. &nbsp;Sherburn run his eye
 slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
 out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked
 sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind,
 but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got
 sand in it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he says, slow and scornful:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The idea of <i>you</i> lynching anybody! &nbsp;It's amusing. &nbsp;The idea of
 you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a <i>man</i>! &nbsp;Because you're
 brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come
 along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands
 on a <i>man</i>? &nbsp;Why, a <i>man's</i> safe in the hands of ten thousand of your
 kind?as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do I know you? &nbsp;I know you clear through was born and raised in the
 South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The
 average man's a coward. &nbsp;In the North he lets anybody walk over him
 that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In
 the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the
 daytime, and robbed the lot. &nbsp;Your newspapers call you a brave people
 so much that you think you are braver than any other people?whereas
 you're just <i>as</i> brave, and no braver. &nbsp;Why don't your juries hang
 murderers? &nbsp;Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them
 in the back, in the dark?and it's just what they <i>would</i> do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So they always acquit; and then a <i>man</i> goes in the night, with a hundred
 masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. &nbsp;Your mistake is,
 that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is
 that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks. &nbsp;You brought
 <i>part</i> of a man?Buck Harkness, there?and if you hadn't had him
 to start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You didn't want to come. &nbsp;The average man don't like trouble and
 danger. <i>You</i> don't like trouble and danger. &nbsp;But if only <i>half</i> a man?like
 Buck Harkness, there?shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're afraid to
 back down?afraid you'll be found out to be what you are?<i>cowards</i>?and
 so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's
 coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going
 to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is?a
 mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage
 that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. &nbsp;But a mob
 without any <i>man</i> at the head of it is <i>beneath</i> pitifulness. &nbsp;Now the
 thing for <i>you</i> to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a
 hole. &nbsp;If any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the
 dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and
 fetch a <i>man</i> along. &nbsp;Now <i>leave</i>?and take your half-a-man with
 you"?tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he
 says this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
 off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
 tolerable cheap. &nbsp;I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want
 to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
 went by, and then dived in under the tent. &nbsp;I had my twenty-dollar
 gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
 there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home
 and amongst strangers that way. &nbsp;You can't be too careful. &nbsp;I
 ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way,
 but there ain't no use in <i>wasting</i> it on them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a real bully circus. &nbsp;It was the splendidest sight that ever
 was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
 by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor
 stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable?there
 must a been twenty of them?and every lady with a lovely complexion,
 and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough
 queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just
 littered with diamonds. &nbsp;It was a powerful fine sight; I never see
 anything so lovely. &nbsp;And then one by one they got up and stood, and
 went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men
 looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and
 skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady's
 rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking
 like the most loveliest parasol.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot
 out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and
 the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip
 and shouting "Hi!?hi!" and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and
 by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on
 her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did
 lean over and hump themselves! &nbsp;And so one after the other they all
 skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then
 scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
 all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. &nbsp;The
 ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as
 a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever <i>could</i>
 think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't
 noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and
 by a drunk man tried to get into the ring?said he wanted to ride;
 said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. &nbsp;They argued and
 tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to
 a standstill. &nbsp;Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of
 him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred
 up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and
 swarm towards the ring, saying, "Knock him down! throw him out!" and one
 or two women begun to scream. &nbsp;So, then, the ringmaster he made a
 little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if
 the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him
 ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. &nbsp;So everybody laughed
 and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse
 begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men
 hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on
 to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole
 crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down.
 &nbsp;And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse
 broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the
 ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first
 one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on
 t'other side, and the people just crazy. &nbsp;It warn't funny to me,
 though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. &nbsp;But pretty soon he
 struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and
 that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood!
 and the horse a-going like a house afire too. &nbsp;He just stood up
 there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk
 in his life?and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling
 them. &nbsp;He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and
 altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and
 handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit
 into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum?and finally
 skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and
 everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he <i>was</i> the sickest
 ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. &nbsp;Why, it was one of his own men!
 &nbsp;He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to
 nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't a
 been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. &nbsp;I don't
 know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never
 struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for <i>me</i>; and wherever I
 run across it, it can have all of <i>my</i> custom every time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, that night we had <i>our</i> show; but there warn't only about twelve
 people there?just enough to pay expenses. &nbsp;And they laughed all
 the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
 the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. &nbsp;So the duke said
 these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
 was low comedy?and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
 reckoned. &nbsp;He said he could size their style. &nbsp;So next morning
 he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed
 off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. &nbsp;The
 bills said:

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a
 curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was
 jam full of men in no time. &nbsp;When the place couldn't hold no more,
 the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to
 the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and
 praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that
 ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund
 Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at
 last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up
 the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all
 fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all
 sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. &nbsp;And?but never mind
 the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The
 people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done
 capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and
 stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after
 that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to
 see the shines that old idiot cut.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
 the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
 pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in
 Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
 succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
 obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and
 see it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Twenty people sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, is it over? &nbsp;Is that <i>all</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says yes. &nbsp;Then there was a fine time. &nbsp;Everybody sings
 out, "Sold!" and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them
 tragedians. &nbsp;But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and
 shouts:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on! &nbsp;Just a word, gentlemen." &nbsp;They stopped to listen.
 &nbsp;"We are sold?mighty badly sold. &nbsp;But we don't want to be
 the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last
 of this thing as long as we live. &nbsp;<i>No</i>. &nbsp;What we want is to go
 out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the <i>rest</i> of the town!
 &nbsp;Then we'll all be in the same boat. &nbsp;Ain't that sensible?"
 ("You bet it is!?the jedge is right!" everybody sings out.) "All
 right, then?not a word about any sell. &nbsp;Go along home, and
 advise everybody to come and see the tragedy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that
 show was. &nbsp;House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd
 the same way. &nbsp;When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft
 we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me
 back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in
 and hide her about two mile below town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The third night the house was crammed again?and they warn't
 new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two
 nights. &nbsp;I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man
 that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his
 coat?and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.
 &nbsp;I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such
 things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I
 do, there was sixty-four of them went in. &nbsp;I shoved in there for a
 minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. &nbsp;Well,
 when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a
 quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started
 around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the
 corner and was in the dark he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the
 raft like the dickens was after you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I done it, and he done the same. &nbsp;We struck the raft at the same
 time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark
 and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
 word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
 audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
 the wigwam, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?" &nbsp;He hadn't been
 up-town at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then
 we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their
 bones loose over the way they'd served them people. &nbsp;The duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Greenhorns, flatheads! &nbsp;I knew the first house would keep mum and
 let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the
 third night, and consider it was <i>their</i> turn now. &nbsp;Well, it <i>is</i> their
 turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. &nbsp;I
 <i>would</i> just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity. &nbsp;They
 can turn it into a picnic if they want to?they brought plenty
 provisions."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
 three nights. &nbsp;I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like
 that before. &nbsp;By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:

 "Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," I says, "it don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't it, Huck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. &nbsp;I reckon they're all
 alike."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what dey
 is; dey's reglar rapscallions."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur
 as I can make out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is dat so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You read about them once?you'll see. &nbsp;Look at Henry the Eight;
 this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to <i>him</i>. &nbsp;And look at
 Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second,
 and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them
 Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.
 &nbsp;My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.
 &nbsp;He <i>was</i> a blossom. &nbsp;He used to marry a new wife every day, and
 chop off her head next morning. &nbsp;And he would do it just as
 indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. &nbsp;'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he
 says. &nbsp;They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' &nbsp;And
 they chop it off. &nbsp;'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes,
 Next morning, 'Chop off her head'?and they chop it off. &nbsp;'Ring
 up Fair Rosamun.' &nbsp;Fair Rosamun answers the bell. &nbsp;Next morning,
 'Chop off her head.' &nbsp;And he made every one of them tell him a tale
 every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one
 tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday
 Book?which was a good name and stated the case. &nbsp;You don't know
 kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the
 cleanest I've struck in history. &nbsp;Well, Henry he takes a notion he
 wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it?give
 notice??give the country a show? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;All of a sudden he
 heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a
 declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. &nbsp;That was <i>his</i>
 style?he never give anybody a chance. &nbsp;He had suspicions of his
 father, the Duke of Wellington. &nbsp;Well, what did he do? &nbsp;Ask him
 to show up? &nbsp;No?drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.
 &nbsp;S'pose people left money laying around where he was?what did
 he do? &nbsp;He collared it. &nbsp;S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and
 you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it?what
 did he do? &nbsp;He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his
 mouth?what then? &nbsp;If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd
 lose a lie every time. &nbsp;That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if
 we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap
 worse than ourn done. &nbsp;I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they
 ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing
 to <i>that</i> old ram, anyway. &nbsp;All I say is, kings is kings, and you got
 to make allowances. &nbsp;Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery
 lot. It's the way they're raised."

 <p>
 "But dis one do <i>smell</i> so like de nation, Huck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they all do, Jim. &nbsp;We can't help the way a king smells;
 history don't tell no way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, a duke's different. &nbsp;But not very different. &nbsp;This one's a
 middling hard lot for a duke. &nbsp;When he's drunk there ain't no
 near-sighted man could tell him from a king."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck. &nbsp;Dese is all I
 kin stan'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the way I feel, too, Jim. &nbsp;But we've got them on our hands, and
 we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. &nbsp;Sometimes I
 wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? &nbsp;It
 wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: &nbsp;you
 couldn't tell them from the real kind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. &nbsp;He
 often done that. &nbsp;When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting
 there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to
 himself. &nbsp;I didn't take notice nor let on. &nbsp;I knowed what it was
 about. &nbsp;He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up
 yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from
 home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his
 people as white folks does for their'n. &nbsp;It don't seem natural, but I
 reckon it's so. &nbsp;He was often moaning and mourning that way nights,
 when he judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little
 Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no
 mo'!" &nbsp;He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
 ones; and by and by he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on
 de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I
 treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. &nbsp;She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
 the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
 duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. &nbsp;Jim
 he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours,
 because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day
 in the wigwam tied with the rope. &nbsp;You see, when we left him all
 alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by
 himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger,
 you know. So the duke said it <i>was</i> kind of hard to have to lay roped all
 day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. &nbsp;He
 dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit?it was a long curtain-calico
 gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his
 theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over
 a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.
 &nbsp;Blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.
 &nbsp;Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sick Arab?but harmless when not out of his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
 foot in front of the wigwam. &nbsp;Jim was satisfied. &nbsp;He said it was
 a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling
 all over every time there was a sound. &nbsp;The duke told him to make
 himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must
 hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
 a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
 &nbsp;Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and
 he wouldn't wait for him to howl. &nbsp;Why, he didn't only look like he
 was dead, he looked considerable more than that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so
 much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the
 news might a worked along down by this time. &nbsp;They couldn't hit no
 project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay
 off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up
 something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
 over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to
 lead him the profitable way?meaning the devil, I reckon. &nbsp;We
 had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put
 his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. &nbsp;I done it, of course.
 &nbsp;The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and
 starchy. &nbsp;I never knowed how clothes could change a body before.
 &nbsp;Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but
 now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a
 smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had
 walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. &nbsp;Jim
 cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. &nbsp;There was a big
 steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile
 above the town?been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.
 &nbsp;Says the king:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
 Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. &nbsp;Go for the steamboat,
 Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. &nbsp;I
 fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting
 along the bluff bank in the easy water. &nbsp;Pretty soon we come to a
 nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
 sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
 couple of big carpet-bags by him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Run her nose in shore," says the king. &nbsp;I done it. &nbsp;"Wher' you
 bound for, young man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For the steamboat; going to Orleans."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Git aboard," says the king. &nbsp;"Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p
 you with them bags. &nbsp;Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus"?meaning
 me, I see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I done so, and then we all three started on again. &nbsp;The young chap
 was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such
 weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd
 come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now
 he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. &nbsp;The
 young fellow says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come
 mighty near getting here in time.' &nbsp;But then I says again, 'No, I
 reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' &nbsp;You
 <i>ain't</i> him, are you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my name's Blodgett?Elexander Blodgett?<i>Reverend</i> Elexander
 Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.
 &nbsp;But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not
 arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it?which
 I hope he hasn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all right;
 but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die?which he mayn't mind,
 nobody can tell as to that?but his brother would a give anything in
 this world to see <i>him</i> before he died; never talked about nothing else all
 these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together?and
 hadn't ever seen his brother William at all?that's the deef and dumb
 one?William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. &nbsp;Peter and
 George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
 brother; him and his wife both died last year. &nbsp;Harvey and William's
 the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here
 in time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did anybody send 'em word?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
 said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time.
 You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to be much
 company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was
 kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care
 much to live. &nbsp;He most desperately wanted to see Harvey?and
 William, too, for that matter?because he was one of them kind that
 can't bear to make a will. &nbsp;He left a letter behind for Harvey, and
 said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest
 of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right?for
 George didn't leave nothing. &nbsp;And that letter was all they could get
 him to put a pen to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? &nbsp;Wher' does he live?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he lives in England?Sheffield?preaches there?hasn't
 ever been in this country. &nbsp;He hasn't had any too much time?and
 besides he mightn't a got the letter at all, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You
 going to Orleans, you say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. &nbsp;I'm going in a ship, next
 Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pretty long journey. &nbsp;But it'll be lovely; wisht I was
 a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? &nbsp;How old is the others?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen?that's
 the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they could be worse off. &nbsp;Old Peter had friends, and they
 ain't going to let them come to no harm. &nbsp;There's Hobson, the Babtis'
 preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and
 Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow
 Bartley, and?well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones
 that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he
 wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets
 here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
 that young fellow. &nbsp;Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and
 everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
 Peter's business?which was a tanner; and about George's?which
 was a carpenter; and about Harvey's?which was a dissentering
 minister; and so on, and so on. &nbsp;Then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop
 there. &nbsp;When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. &nbsp;A
 Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was Peter Wilks well off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, pretty well off. &nbsp;He had houses and land, and it's reckoned
 he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When did you say he died?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't say, but it was last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Funeral to-morrow, likely?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or
 another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir, it's the best way. &nbsp;Ma used to always say that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
 got off. &nbsp;The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
 my ride, after all. &nbsp;When the boat was gone the king made me paddle
 up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
 carpet-bags. &nbsp;And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there
 and git him. &nbsp;And tell him to git himself up regardless. &nbsp;Shove
 along, now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see what <i>he</i> was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. &nbsp;When I
 got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log,
 and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it?every
 last word of it. &nbsp;And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk
 like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can't
 imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he really done it
 pretty good. &nbsp;Then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and
 dumb person on the histronic boards. &nbsp;So then they waited for a
 steamboat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but
 they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a
 big one, and they hailed her. &nbsp;She sent out her yawl, and we went
 aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to
 go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said
 they wouldn't land us. &nbsp;But the king was ca'm. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
 put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
 village they yawled us ashore. &nbsp;About two dozen men flocked down when
 they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?" they give
 a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, "What
 d' I tell you?" &nbsp;Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he <i>did</i> live
 yesterday evening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
 against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
 back, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas, alas, our poor brother?gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
 it's too, too hard!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
 duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out
 a-crying. &nbsp;If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that
 ever I struck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
 sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
 for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
 his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his
 hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
 they'd lost the twelve disciples. &nbsp;Well, if ever I struck anything
 like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
 race.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
 tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
 their coats as they come. &nbsp;Pretty soon we was in the middle of a
 crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. &nbsp;The
 windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over
 a fence:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it <i>them</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
 three girls was standing in the door. &nbsp;Mary Jane <i>was</i> red-headed, but
 that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face
 and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was
 come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and
 the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! &nbsp;Everybody
 most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and
 have such good times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the king he hunched the duke private?I see him do it?and
 then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two
 chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's
 shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over
 there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and
 noise stopping, people saying "Sh!" and all the men taking their hats off
 and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. &nbsp;And when
 they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one
 sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to
 Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's necks, and
 hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes,
 or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. &nbsp;And, mind
 you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see
 anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and
 t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads
 on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. &nbsp;Well, when it
 come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
 everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud?the poor
 girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying
 a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
 on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down,
 and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next
 woman a show. &nbsp;I never see anything so disgusting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works
 himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle
 about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
 diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four
 thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by
 this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his
 heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they
 can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush,
 till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody
 Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
 struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and
 it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.
 Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never
 see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
 nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
 would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the
 ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
 speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to
 him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to
 wit, as follows, vizz.:?Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and
 Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson,
 and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
 together?that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to
 t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. &nbsp;Lawyer Bell
 was away up to Louisville on business. &nbsp;But the rest was on hand, and
 so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked
 to him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing,
 but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
 whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said "Goo-goo?goo-goo-goo"
 all the time, like a baby that can't talk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much
 everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little
 things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's
 family, or to Peter. &nbsp;And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
 things; but that was a lie: &nbsp;he got every blessed one of them out of
 that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king
 he read it out loud and cried over it. &nbsp;It give the dwelling-house
 and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
 (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land
 (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey
 and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.
 &nbsp;So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have
 everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
 &nbsp;We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they
 spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
 yaller-boys. &nbsp;My, the way the king's eyes did shine! &nbsp;He slaps
 the duke on the shoulder and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>this</i> ain't bully nor noth'n! &nbsp;Oh, no, I reckon not! &nbsp;Why,
 <i>bully</i>, it beats the Nonesuch, <i>don't</i> it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke allowed it did. &nbsp;They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
 through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and
 representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and
 me, Bilge. &nbsp;Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence. &nbsp;It's the
 best way, in the long run. &nbsp;I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no
 better way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;
 but no, they must count it. &nbsp;So they counts it, and it comes out four
 hundred and fifteen dollars short. &nbsp;Says the king:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
 dollars?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. &nbsp;Then
 the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake?I
 reckon that's the way of it. &nbsp;The best way's to let it go, and keep
 still about it. &nbsp;We can spare it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, shucks, yes, we can <i>spare</i> it. &nbsp;I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout that?it's
 the <i>count</i> I'm thinkin' about. &nbsp;We want to be awful square and open
 and above-board here, you know. &nbsp;We want to lug this h-yer money up
 stairs and count it before everybody?then ther' ain't noth'n
 suspicious. &nbsp;But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars,
 you know, we don't want to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on," says the duke. &nbsp;"Le's make up the deffisit," and he begun
 to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke?you <i>have</i> got a rattlin' clever
 head on you," says the king. &nbsp;"Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a
 heppin' us out agin," and <i>he</i> begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack
 them up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say," says the duke, "I got another idea. &nbsp;Le's go up stairs and
 count this money, and then take and <i>give it to the girls</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good land, duke, lemme hug you! &nbsp;It's the most dazzling idea 'at
 ever a man struck. &nbsp;You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I
 ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it.
 &nbsp;Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to?this
 'll lay 'em out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he
 counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile?twenty
 elegant little piles. &nbsp;Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked
 their chops. &nbsp;Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the
 king begin to swell himself up for another speech. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
 that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. &nbsp;He has done generous by
 these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left
 fatherless and motherless. &nbsp;Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
 would a done <i>more</i> generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his
 dear William and me. &nbsp;Now, <i>wouldn't</i> he? &nbsp;Ther' ain't no question
 'bout it in <i>my</i> mind. &nbsp;Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be
 that 'd stand in his way at sech a time? &nbsp;And what kind o' uncles
 would it be that 'd rob?yes, <i>rob</i>?sech poor sweet lambs as
 these 'at he loved so at sech a time? &nbsp;If I know William?and I
 <i>think</i> I do?he?well, I'll jest ask him." He turns around and
 begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he
 looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he
 seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all
 his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.
 &nbsp;Then the king says, "I knowed it; I reckon <i>that 'll</i> convince anybody
 the way <i>he</i> feels about it. &nbsp;Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the
 money?take it <i>all</i>. &nbsp;It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold
 but joyful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and
 then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. &nbsp;And everybody
 crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of
 them frauds, saying all the time:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You <i>dear</i> good souls!?how <i>lovely</i>!?how <i>could</i> you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again,
 and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long
 a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood
 a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying
 anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy
 listening. &nbsp;The king was saying?in the middle of something he'd
 started in on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. &nbsp;That's why
 they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want <i>all</i> to come?everybody;
 for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that
 his funeral orgies sh'd be public."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every
 little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he
 couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
 "<i>Obsequies</i>, you old fool," and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
 reaching it over people's heads to him. &nbsp;The king he reads it and
 puts it in his pocket, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor William, afflicted as he is, his <i>heart's</i> aluz right. &nbsp;Asks me
 to invite everybody to come to the funeral?wants me to make 'em all
 welcome. &nbsp;But he needn't a worried?it was jest what I was at."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his
 funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. &nbsp;And
 when he done it the third time he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it ain't?obsequies
 bein' the common term?but because orgies is the right term.
 Obsequies ain't used in England no more now?it's gone out. &nbsp;We
 say orgies now in England. &nbsp;Orgies is better, because it means the
 thing you're after more exact. &nbsp;It's a word that's made up out'n the
 Greek <i>orgo</i>, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew <i>jeesum</i>, to plant, cover
 up; hence in<i>ter.</i> &nbsp;So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
 funeral."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was the <i>worst</i> I ever struck. &nbsp;Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
 right in his face. &nbsp;Everybody was shocked. &nbsp;Everybody says,
 "Why, <i>doctor</i>!" and Abner Shackleford says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? &nbsp;This is Harvey Wilks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? &nbsp;I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep your hands off of me!" says the doctor. &nbsp;"<i>You</i> talk like an
 Englishman, <i>don't</i> you? &nbsp;It's the worst imitation I ever heard. &nbsp;<i>You</i>
 Peter Wilks's brother! &nbsp;You're a fraud, that's what you are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, how they all took on! &nbsp;They crowded around the doctor and tried
 to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd
 showed in forty ways that he <i>was</i> Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and
 the names of the very dogs, and begged and <i>begged</i> him not to hurt Harvey's
 feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that. &nbsp;But it warn't
 no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an
 Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a
 fraud and a liar. &nbsp;The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying;
 and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on <i>them</i>. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a
 friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
 harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to
 do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he
 calls it. &nbsp;He is the thinnest kind of an impostor?has come here
 with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you
 take them for <i>proofs</i>, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish
 friends here, who ought to know better. &nbsp;Mary Jane Wilks, you know me
 for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. &nbsp;Now listen to
 me; turn this pitiful rascal out?I <i>beg</i> you to do it. &nbsp;Will
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! &nbsp;She
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Here</i> is my answer." &nbsp;She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
 king's hands, and says, "Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me
 and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
 hare-lip done the same on the other. &nbsp;Everybody clapped their hands
 and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
 head and smiled proud. &nbsp;The doctor says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right; I wash <i>my</i> hands of the matter. &nbsp;But I warn you all that a
 time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this
 day." And away he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him; "we'll try and get
 'em to send for you;" which made them all laugh, and they said it was a
 prime good hit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
 for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
 Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a
 little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep
 on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king
 said the cubby would do for his valley?meaning me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain
 but nice. &nbsp;She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps
 took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said they
 warn't. &nbsp;The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a
 curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. &nbsp;There was an
 old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
 of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
 with. &nbsp;The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter
 for these fixings, and so don't disturb them. &nbsp;The duke's room was
 pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
 and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and
 the niggers waited on the rest. &nbsp;Mary Jane she set at the head of the
 table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and
 how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens
 was?and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force
 out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said
 so?said "How <i>do</i> you get biscuits to brown so nice?" and "Where, for
 the land's sake, <i>did</i> you get these amaz'n pickles?" and all that kind of
 humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off
 of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the
 things. &nbsp;The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
 if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. &nbsp;She
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you ever see the king?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who? &nbsp;William Fourth? &nbsp;Well, I bet I have?he goes to our
 church." &nbsp;I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. &nbsp;So
 when I says he goes to our church, she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?regular?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?regular. &nbsp;His pew's right over opposite ourn?on
 t'other side the pulpit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought he lived in London?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, he does. &nbsp;Where <i>would</i> he live?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I thought <i>you</i> lived in Sheffield?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see I was up a stump. &nbsp;I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
 bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. &nbsp;Then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield. &nbsp;That's
 only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how you talk?Sheffield ain't on the sea."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, who said it was?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I <i>didn't</i> nuther."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never said nothing of the kind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what <i>did</i> you say, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Said he come to take the sea <i>baths</i>?that's what I said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here," I says; "did you ever see any Congress-water?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, no."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
 bath."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How does he get it, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water?in barrels.
 &nbsp;There in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants
 his water hot. &nbsp;They can't bile that amount of water away off there
 at the sea. They haven't got no conveniences for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I see, now. &nbsp;You might a said that in the first place and saved
 time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
 comfortable and glad. &nbsp;Next, she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you go to church, too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?regular."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where do you set?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, in our pew."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Whose</i> pew?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, <i>ourn</i>?your Uncle Harvey's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His'n? &nbsp;What does <i>he</i> want with a pew?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wants it to set in. &nbsp;What did you <i>reckon</i> he wanted with it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. &nbsp;I see I was up a stump again,
 so I played another chicken bone and got another think. &nbsp;Then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what do they want with more?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!?to preach before a king? &nbsp;I never did see such a girl as
 you. They don't have no less than seventeen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seventeen! &nbsp;My land! &nbsp;Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as
 that, not if I <i>never</i> got to glory. &nbsp;It must take 'em a week."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks, they don't <i>all</i> of 'em preach the same day?only <i>one</i> of 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing much. &nbsp;Loll around, pass the plate?and one thing
 or another. &nbsp;But mainly they don't do nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what are they <i>for</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, they're for <i>style</i>. &nbsp;Don't you know nothing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't <i>want</i> to know no such foolishness as that. &nbsp;How is
 servants treated in England? &nbsp;Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat
 our niggers?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>No</i>! &nbsp;A servant ain't nobody there. &nbsp;They treat them worse than
 dogs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's
 week, and Fourth of July?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, just listen! &nbsp;A body could tell <i>you</i> hain't ever been to England
 by that. &nbsp;Why, Hare-l?why, Joanna, they never see a holiday
 from year's end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor
 nigger shows, nor nowheres."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor church?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor church."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But <i>you</i> always went to church."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I was gone up again. &nbsp;I forgot I was the old man's servant.
 &nbsp;But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a
 valley was different from a common servant and <i>had</i> to go to church whether
 he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
 law. &nbsp;But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
 warn't satisfied. &nbsp;She says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honest injun," says I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None of it at all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None of it at all. &nbsp;Not a lie in it," says I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lay your hand on this book and say it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said
 it. &nbsp;So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll
 believe the rest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says Mary Jane, stepping in with
 Susan behind her. &nbsp;"It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to
 him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. &nbsp;How would you
 like to be treated so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's always your way, Maim?always sailing in to help somebody
 before they're hurt. &nbsp;I hain't done nothing to him. &nbsp;He's told
 some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and
 that's every bit and grain I <i>did</i> say. &nbsp;I reckon he can stand a little
 thing like that, can't he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our
 house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. &nbsp;If you
 was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to
 say a thing to another person that will make <i>them</i> feel ashamed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mam, he said?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It don't make no difference what he <i>said</i>?that ain't the thing.
 &nbsp;The thing is for you to treat him <i>kind</i>, and not be saying things to
 make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says to myself, <i>this</i> is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob her
 of her money!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Susan <i>she</i> waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Hare-lip
 hark from the tomb!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says I to myself, and this is <i>another</i> one that I'm letting him rob her of
 her money!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again?which
 was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o'
 poor Hare-lip. &nbsp;So she hollered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, then," says the other girls; "you just ask his pardon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. &nbsp;She done it so
 beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand
 lies, so she could do it again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says to myself, this is <i>another</i> one that I'm letting him rob her of her
 money. &nbsp;And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out
 to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. &nbsp;I felt so
 ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;
 I'll hive that money for them or bust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So then I lit out?for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
 &nbsp;When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. &nbsp;I says
 to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?
 &nbsp;No?that won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king
 and the duke would make it warm for me. &nbsp;Shall I go, private, and
 tell Mary Jane? &nbsp;No?I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a
 hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away
 with it. &nbsp;If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the
 business before it was done with, I judge. &nbsp;No; there ain't no good
 way but one. &nbsp;I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal
 it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good
 thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this
 family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time
 enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the
 river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. &nbsp;But I
 better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as
 much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. &nbsp;Upstairs the hall was
 dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my
 hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody
 else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room
 and begun to paw around there. &nbsp;But I see I couldn't do nothing
 without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. &nbsp;So I judged I'd
 got to do the other thing?lay for them and eavesdrop. &nbsp;About
 that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the
 bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I
 touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind
 that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
 get down and look under the bed. &nbsp;Then I was glad I hadn't found the
 bed when I wanted it. &nbsp;And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to
 hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. &nbsp;They sets
 down then, and the king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what is it? &nbsp;And cut it middlin' short, because it's better
 for us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em
 a chance to talk us over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, this is it, Capet. &nbsp;I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. &nbsp;That
 doctor lays on my mind. &nbsp;I wanted to know your plans. &nbsp;I've got
 a notion, and I think it's a sound one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it, duke?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it
 down the river with what we've got. &nbsp;Specially, seeing we got it so
 easy?<i>given</i> back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
 course we allowed to have to steal it back. &nbsp;I'm for knocking off and
 lighting out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That made me feel pretty bad. &nbsp;About an hour or two ago it would a
 been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
 king rips out and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! &nbsp;And not sell out the rest o' the property? &nbsp;March off
 like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'
 property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in??and all
 good, salable stuff, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't want
 to go no deeper?didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of <i>everything</i>
 they had.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, how you talk!" says the king. &nbsp;"We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing
 at all but jest this money. &nbsp;The people that <i>buys</i> the property is the
 suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it?which
 won't be long after we've slid?the sale won't be valid, and it 'll
 all go back to the estate. &nbsp;These yer orphans 'll git their house
 back agin, and that's enough for <i>them</i>; they're young and spry, and k'n
 easy earn a livin'. &nbsp;<i>they</i> ain't a-goin to suffer. &nbsp;Why, jest
 think?there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off.
 &nbsp;Bless you, <i>they</i> ain't got noth'n' to complain of."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
 right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
 doctor hanging over them. &nbsp;But the king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cuss the doctor! &nbsp;What do we k'yer for <i>him</i>? &nbsp;Hain't we got all
 the fools in town on our side? &nbsp;And ain't that a big enough majority
 in any town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they got ready to go down stairs again. &nbsp;The duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think we put that money in a good place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That cheered me up. &nbsp;I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint
 of no kind to help me. &nbsp;The king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
 the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
 and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not
 borrow some of it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your head's level agin, duke," says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
 under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. &nbsp;I stuck tight
 to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what
 them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
 I'd better do if they did catch me. &nbsp;But the king he got the bag
 before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never
 suspicioned I was around. &nbsp;They took and shoved the bag through a rip
 in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot
 or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger
 only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only
 about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I knowed better. &nbsp;I had it out of there before they was half-way
 down stairs. &nbsp;I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
 could get a chance to do better. &nbsp;I judged I better hide it outside
 of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
 house a good ransacking: &nbsp;I knowed that very well. &nbsp;Then I
 turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a
 wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. &nbsp;By
 and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet
 and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if
 anything was going to happen. &nbsp;But nothing did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't
 begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. &nbsp;So I tiptoed
 along, and got down stairs all right. &nbsp;There warn't a sound
 anywheres. &nbsp;I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see
 the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.
 &nbsp;The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and
 there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was
 open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter;
 so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't
 there. &nbsp;Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back
 behind me. &nbsp;I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the
 only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. &nbsp;The lid was
 shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with
 a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. &nbsp;I tucked the money-bag in
 under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me
 creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind
 the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The person coming was Mary Jane. &nbsp;She went to the coffin, very soft,
 and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I
 see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.
 &nbsp;I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure
 them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and
 everything was all right. &nbsp;They hadn't stirred.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing
 out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about
 it. &nbsp;Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we
 get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane,
 and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's
 going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be
 found when they come to screw on the lid. &nbsp;Then the king 'll get it
 again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to
 smouch it from him. Of course I <i>wanted</i> to slide down and get it out of
 there, but I dasn't try it. &nbsp;Every minute it was getting earlier now,
 and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get
 catched?catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody
 hadn't hired me to take care of. &nbsp;I don't wish to be mixed up in no
 such business as that, I says to myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
 watchers was gone. &nbsp;There warn't nobody around but the family and the
 widow Bartley and our tribe. &nbsp;I watched their faces to see if
 anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
 set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
 set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
 hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. &nbsp;I see the coffin
 lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with
 folks around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
 in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
 people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead
 man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still
 and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their
 eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. &nbsp;There
 warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
 blowing noses?because people always blows them more at a funeral
 than they do at other places except church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
 gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and
 getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no
 more sound than a cat. &nbsp;He never spoke; he moved people around, he
 squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,
 and signs with his hands. &nbsp;Then he took his place over against the
 wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and
 there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had borrowed a melodeum?a sick one; and when everything was
 ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
 colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that
 had a good thing, according to my notion. &nbsp;Then the Reverend Hobson
 opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
 outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one
 dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along;
 the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait?you
 couldn't hear yourself think. &nbsp;It was right down awkward, and nobody
 didn't seem to know what to do. &nbsp;But pretty soon they see that
 long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
 "Don't you worry?just depend on me." &nbsp;Then he stooped down and
 begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the
 people's heads. &nbsp;So he glided along, and the powwow and racket
 getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had
 gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. &nbsp;Then
 in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a
 most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the
 parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. &nbsp;In a minute or two
 here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall
 again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and
 then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck
 out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of
 a coarse whisper, "<i>He had a rat</i>!" &nbsp;Then he drooped down and glided
 along the wall again to his place. &nbsp;You could see it was a great
 satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. &nbsp;A
 little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things
 that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. &nbsp;There warn't no more
 popular man in town than what that undertaker was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
 then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at
 last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
 coffin with his screw-driver. &nbsp;I was in a sweat then, and watched him
 pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft
 as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. &nbsp;So there I was! &nbsp;I
 didn't know whether the money was in there or not. &nbsp;So, says I,
 s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly??now how do I know
 whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't
 find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
 hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
 all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a
 hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the
 whole business!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again?I
 couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. &nbsp;But nothing come of it;
 the faces didn't tell me nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and
 made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
 congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
 hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. &nbsp;He was
 very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
 stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. &nbsp;And
 he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
 that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and
 amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too?tickled
 them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
 him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. &nbsp;Them
 poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
 getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip
 in and change the general tune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the
 property for auction straight off?sale two days after the funeral;
 but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy
 got the first jolt. &nbsp;A couple of nigger traders come along, and the
 king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
 it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
 mother down the river to Orleans. &nbsp;I thought them poor girls and them
 niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other,
 and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. &nbsp;The girls said
 they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from
 the town. &nbsp;I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them
 poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and
 crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust
 out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and
 the niggers would be back home in a week or two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
 flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
 children that way. &nbsp;It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
 bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you
 the duke was powerful uneasy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day was auction day. &nbsp;About broad day in the morning the king
 and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
 that there was trouble. &nbsp;The king says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was you in my room night before last?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, your majesty"?which was the way I always called him when nobody
 but our gang warn't around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was you in there yisterday er last night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, your majesty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honor bright, now?no lies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. &nbsp;I hain't
 been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and
 showed it to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you seen anybody else go in there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop and think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I see the niggers go in there several times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever expected
 it, and then like they <i>had</i>. &nbsp;Then the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, all of them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?leastways, not all at once?that is, I don't think I ever
 see them all come <i>out</i> at once but just one time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello! &nbsp;When was that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was the day we had the funeral. &nbsp;In the morning. &nbsp;It warn't
 early, because I overslept. &nbsp;I was just starting down the ladder, and
 I see them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, go on, <i>go</i> on! &nbsp;What did they do? &nbsp;How'd they act?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They didn't do nothing. &nbsp;And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as
 I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in
 there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and
 found you <i>warn't</i> up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of
 trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Great guns, <i>this</i> is a go!" says the king; and both of them looked pretty
 sick and tolerable silly. &nbsp;They stood there a-thinking and scratching
 their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy
 chuckle, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. &nbsp;They let
 on to be <i>sorry</i> they was going out of this region! &nbsp;And I believed
 they <i>was</i> sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. &nbsp;Don't ever
 tell <i>me</i> any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. &nbsp;Why,
 the way they played that thing it would fool <i>anybody</i>. &nbsp;In my opinion,
 there's a fortune in 'em. &nbsp;If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't
 want a better lay-out than that?and here we've gone and sold 'em for
 a song. &nbsp;Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. &nbsp;Say,
 where <i>is</i> that song?that draft?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the bank for to be collected. &nbsp;Where <i>would</i> it be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, <i>that's</i> all right then, thank goodness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says I, kind of timid-like:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is something gone wrong?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king whirls on me and rips out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None o' your business! &nbsp;You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own
 affairs?if you got any. &nbsp;Long as you're in this town don't you
 forgit <i>that</i>?you hear?" &nbsp;Then he says to the duke, "We got to
 jest swaller it and say noth'n': &nbsp;mum's the word for <i>us</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick sales <i>and</i> small profits! &nbsp;It's a good business?yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king snarls around on him and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. &nbsp;If the
 profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry,
 is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, <i>they'd</i> be in this house yet and we <i>wouldn't</i> if I could a got my
 advice listened to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around
 and lit into <i>me</i> again. &nbsp;He give me down the banks for not coming and
 <i>telling</i> him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way?said
 any fool would a <i>knowed</i> something was up. &nbsp;And then waltzed in and
 cussed <i>himself</i> awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and
 taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do
 it again. &nbsp;So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd
 worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no
 harm by it.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 BY and by it was getting-up time. &nbsp;So I come down the ladder and
 started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was
 open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open
 and she'd been packing things in it?getting ready to go to England.
 &nbsp;But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her
 face in her hands, crying. &nbsp;I felt awful bad to see it; of course
 anybody would. &nbsp;I went in there and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't?most
 always. &nbsp;Tell me about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she done it. &nbsp;And it was the niggers?I just expected it.
 &nbsp;She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for
 her; she didn't know <i>how</i> she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the
 mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more?and
 then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't <i>ever</i> going to see each other any
 more!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they <i>will</i>?and inside of two weeks?and I <i>know</i> it!" says I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Laws, it was out before I could think! &nbsp;And before I could budge she
 throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it <i>again</i>, say it <i>again</i>,
 say it <i>again</i>!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place.
 I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient
 and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a
 person that's had a tooth pulled out. &nbsp;So I went to studying it out.
 &nbsp;I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when
 he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't
 had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me,
 anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like
 the truth is better and actuly <i>safer</i> than a lie. &nbsp;I must lay it by in
 my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and
 unregular. I never see nothing like it. &nbsp;Well, I says to myself at
 last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time,
 though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching
 it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
 could go and stay three or four days?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. &nbsp;Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind why yet. &nbsp;If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will
 see each other again inside of two weeks?here in this house?and
 <i>prove</i> how I know it?will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four
 days?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of <i>you</i> than just your
 word?I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible." &nbsp;She
 smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll
 shut the door?and bolt it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I come back and set down again, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you holler. &nbsp;Just set still and take it like a man. &nbsp;I
 got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a
 bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.
 &nbsp;These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of
 frauds?regular dead-beats. &nbsp;There, now we're over the worst of
 it, you can stand the rest middling easy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
 water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all
 the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that
 young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung
 herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her
 sixteen or seventeen times?and then up she jumps, with her face
 afire like sunset, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The brute! &nbsp;Come, don't waste a minute?not a <i>second</i>?we'll
 have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says I:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cert'nly. &nbsp;But do you mean <i>before</i> you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh," she says, "what am I <i>thinking</i> about!" she says, and set right down
 again. &nbsp;"Don't mind what I said?please don't?you <i>won't,</i>
 now, <i>will</i> you?" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I
 said I would die first. &nbsp;"I never thought, I was so stirred up," she
 says; "now go on, and I won't do so any more. &nbsp;You tell me what to
 do, and whatever you say I'll do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," I says, "it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so I
 got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not?I
 druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
 get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another
 person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. &nbsp;Well, we
 got to save <i>him</i>, hain't we? &nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;Well, then, we won't
 blow on them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Saying them words put a good idea in my head. &nbsp;I see how maybe I
 could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then
 leave. But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody
 aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin
 working till pretty late to-night. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay
 at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. &nbsp;How fur is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little short of four miles?right out in the country, back here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that 'll answer. &nbsp;Now you go along out there, and lay low till
 nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again?tell
 them you've thought of something. &nbsp;If you get here before eleven put
 a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait <i>till</i> eleven, and <i>then</i>
 if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then
 you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good," she says, "I'll do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along
 with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and
 you must stand by me all you can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stand by you! indeed I will. &nbsp;They sha'n't touch a hair of your
 head!" she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she
 said it, too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I get away I sha'n't be here," I says, "to prove these rapscallions
 ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I <i>was</i> here. &nbsp;I could swear
 they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.
 Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're
 people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. &nbsp;I'll tell
 you how to find them. &nbsp;Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. &nbsp;There?'Royal
 Nonesuch, Bricksville.' &nbsp;Put it away, and don't lose it. &nbsp;When
 the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
 Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
 and ask for some witnesses?why, you'll have that entire town down
 here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. &nbsp;And they'll come
 a-biling, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. &nbsp;So I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. &nbsp;Nobody don't
 have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
 accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they
 get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count,
 and they ain't going to get no money. &nbsp;It's just like the way it was
 with the niggers?it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back
 before long. &nbsp;Why, they can't collect the money for the <i>niggers</i> yet?they're
 in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start
 straight for Mr. Lothrop's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Deed, <i>that</i> ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," I says, "by no manner of
 means; go <i>before</i> breakfast."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I never thought?and come to think, I don't know. &nbsp;What
 was it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. &nbsp;I
 don't want no better book than what your face is. &nbsp;A body can set
 down and read it off like coarse print. &nbsp;Do you reckon you can go and
 face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there, don't! &nbsp;Yes, I'll go before breakfast?I'll be
 glad to. And leave my sisters with them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; never mind about them. &nbsp;They've got to stand it yet a while.
 &nbsp;They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. &nbsp;I
 don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if
 a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell
 something. &nbsp;No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it
 with all of them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles
 and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and
 change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the
 morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to
 them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, it sha'n't be." &nbsp;It was well enough to tell <i>her</i> so?no
 harm in it. &nbsp;It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and
 it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here
 below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.
 &nbsp;Then I says: &nbsp;"There's one more thing?that bag of money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think <i>how</i>
 they got it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you're out, there. &nbsp;They hain't got it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, who's got it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish I knowed, but I don't. &nbsp;I <i>had</i> it, because I stole it from
 them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm
 afraid it ain't there no more. &nbsp;I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm
 just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.
 &nbsp;I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first
 place I come to, and run?and it warn't a good place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, stop blaming yourself?it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow
 it?you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. &nbsp;Where did you
 hide it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
 couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
 corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. &nbsp;So
 for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd ruther not <i>tell</i> you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind
 letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can
 read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. &nbsp;Do you
 reckon that 'll do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I wrote: &nbsp;"I put it in the coffin. &nbsp;It was in there when you
 was crying there, away in the night. &nbsp;I was behind the door, and I
 was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself
 in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof,
 shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I
 see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Good</i>-bye. &nbsp;I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if
 I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of
 you a many and a many a time, and I'll <i>pray</i> for you, too!"?and she
 was gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pray for me! &nbsp;I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was
 more nearer her size. &nbsp;But I bet she done it, just the same?she
 was just that kind. &nbsp;She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took
 the notion?there warn't no back-down to her, I judge. &nbsp;You may
 say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any
 girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. &nbsp;It sounds
 like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. &nbsp;And when it comes to beauty?and
 goodness, too?she lays over them all. &nbsp;I hain't ever seen her
 since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen
 her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a million
 times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought
 it would do any good for me to pray for <i>her</i>, blamed if I wouldn't a done
 it or bust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her
 go. &nbsp;When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you
 all goes to see sometimes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it. &nbsp;Well, Miss Mary Jane
 she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry?one
 of them's sick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which one?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sakes alive, I hope it ain't <i>Hanner</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's the very one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My goodness, and she so well only last week! &nbsp;Is she took bad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't no name for it. &nbsp;They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
 Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only think of that, now! &nbsp;What's the matter with her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mumps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mumps your granny! &nbsp;They don't set up with people that's got the
 mumps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They don't, don't they? &nbsp;You better bet they do with <i>these</i> mumps.
 &nbsp;These mumps is different. &nbsp;It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane
 said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's it a new kind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because it's mixed up with other things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What other things?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
 yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My land! &nbsp;And they call it the <i>mumps</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what Miss Mary Jane said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what in the nation do they call it the <i>mumps</i> for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, because it <i>is</i> the mumps. &nbsp;That's what it starts with."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. &nbsp;A body might stump his toe, and
 take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his
 brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some
 numskull up and say, 'Why, he stumped his <i>toe</i>.' &nbsp;Would ther' be any
 sense in that? <i>No</i>. &nbsp;And ther' ain't no sense in <i>this</i>, nuther. &nbsp;Is
 it ketching?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it <i>ketching</i>? &nbsp;Why, how you talk. &nbsp;Is a <i>harrow</i> catching?in
 the dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,
 ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the
 whole harrow along, can you? &nbsp;Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of
 a harrow, as you may say?and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther,
 you come to get it hitched on good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip. &nbsp;"I'll go to Uncle
 Harvey and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes," I says, "I <i>would</i>. &nbsp;Of <i>course</i> I would. &nbsp;I wouldn't
 lose no time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, why wouldn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. &nbsp;Hain't your uncles
 obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? &nbsp;And do you
 reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
 journey by yourselves? &nbsp;<i>you</i> know they'll wait for you. &nbsp;So fur,
 so good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? &nbsp;Very well, then;
 is a <i>preacher</i> going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a
 <i>ship clerk?</i>?so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?
 &nbsp;Now <i>you</i> know he ain't. &nbsp;What <i>will</i> he do, then? &nbsp;Why, he'll
 say, 'It's a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the
 best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful
 pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait
 the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it.' &nbsp;But never
 mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncle Harvey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
 times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got
 it or not? &nbsp;Why, you talk like a muggins."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Listen at that, now. &nbsp;You do beat all for natural stupidness. &nbsp;Can't
 you <i>see</i> that <i>they'd</i> go and tell? &nbsp;Ther' ain't no way but just to not
 tell anybody at <i>all</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, maybe you're right?yes, I judge you <i>are</i> right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,
 anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. &nbsp;She says, 'Tell them
 to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over
 the river to see Mr.'?Mr.?what <i>is</i> the name of that rich family
 your uncle Peter used to think so much of??I mean the one that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to remember
 them, half the time, somehow. &nbsp;Yes, she said, say she has run over
 for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this
 house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than
 anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come,
 and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll
 be home in the morning anyway. &nbsp;She said, don't say nothing about the
 Proctors, but only about the Apthorps?which 'll be perfectly true,
 because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know
 it, because she told me so herself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give
 them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everything was all right now. &nbsp;The girls wouldn't say nothing because
 they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary
 Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor
 Robinson. &nbsp;I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat?I
 reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself. &nbsp;Of course
 he would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not
 being brung up to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of
 the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he
 was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
 auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
 goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for
 sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.

 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold?everything
 but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. &nbsp;So they'd got to
 work that off?I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
 to swallow <i>everything</i>. &nbsp;Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat
 landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling
 and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Here's</i> your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter
 Wilks?and you pays your money and you takes your choice!"

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
 nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. &nbsp;And, my
 souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. &nbsp;But I
 didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the
 king some to see any. &nbsp;I reckoned they'd turn pale. &nbsp;But no,
 nary a pale did <i>they</i> turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what
 was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug
 that's googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and
 gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache
 in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
 world. &nbsp;Oh, he done it admirable. &nbsp;Lots of the principal people
 gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. &nbsp;That
 old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. &nbsp;Pretty
 soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced <i>like</i> an
 Englishman?not the king's way, though the king's <i>was</i> pretty good for
 an imitation. &nbsp;I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate
 him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
 acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and
 answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm,
 and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
 by a mistake. &nbsp;I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his
 brother William, which can't hear nor speak?and can't even make
 signs to amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with.
 &nbsp;We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the
 baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go
 to the hotel and wait."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers
 out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Broke his arm?<i>very</i> likely, <i>ain't</i> it??and very convenient,
 too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. &nbsp;Lost
 their baggage! That's <i>mighty</i> good!?and mighty ingenious?under
 the <i>circumstances</i>!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or
 maybe half a dozen. &nbsp;One of these was that doctor; another one was a
 sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made
 out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was
 talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then
 and nodding their heads?it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
 up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
 and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king
 now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The day before the funeral, friend," says the king.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what time o' day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the evenin'?'bout an hour er two before sundown."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>How'd</i> you come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the <i>mornin</i>'?in a
 canoe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
 old man and a preacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. &nbsp;He was up at the Pint
 that mornin'. &nbsp;I live up there, don't I? &nbsp;Well, I was up there,
 and he was up there. &nbsp;I see him there. &nbsp;He come in a canoe,
 along with Tim Collins and a boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor he up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon I would, but I don't know. &nbsp;Why, yonder he is, now. &nbsp;I
 know him perfectly easy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was me he pointed at. &nbsp;The doctor says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
 <i>these</i> two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. &nbsp;I think it's our
 duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this
 thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. &nbsp;We'll take
 these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I
 reckon we'll find out <i>something</i> before we get through."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we
 all started. &nbsp;It was about sundown. &nbsp;The doctor he led me along
 by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
 fetched in the new couple. &nbsp;First, the doctor says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds,
 and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about. &nbsp;If
 they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks
 left? &nbsp;It ain't unlikely. &nbsp;If these men ain't frauds, they won't
 object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
 they're all right?ain't that so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody agreed to that. &nbsp;So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
 tight place right at the outstart. &nbsp;But the king he only looked
 sorrowful, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to
 throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o'
 this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send and
 see, if you want to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is it, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
 inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few
 days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' used
 to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England. &nbsp;The
 niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down stairs; and
 when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away with
 it. &nbsp;My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't altogether
 believe him. &nbsp;One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. &nbsp;I
 said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
 never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up
 my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
 &nbsp;That was all they asked me. &nbsp;Then the doctor whirls on me and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are <i>you</i> English, too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, "Stuff!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
 it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
 supper, nor ever seemed to think about it?and so they kept it up,
 and kept it up; and it <i>was</i> the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. &nbsp;They
 made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;
 and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a <i>seen</i> that the old
 gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. &nbsp;And by and by
 they had me up to tell what I knowed. &nbsp;The king he give me a
 left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to
 talk on the right side. &nbsp;I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we
 lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't
 get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer,
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. &nbsp;I reckon
 you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
 practice. &nbsp;You do it pretty awkward."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
 anyway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell?" The king broke in and
 reached out his hand, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
 about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,
 and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked
 low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That 'll fix it. &nbsp;I'll take the order and send it, along with your
 brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his
 head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and
 then they give the pen to the duke?and then for the first time the
 duke looked sick. &nbsp;But he took the pen and wrote. &nbsp;So then the
 lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. &nbsp;The lawyer
 looked powerful astonished, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it beats <i>me</i>"?and snaked a lot of old letters out of his
 pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and
 then <i>them</i> again; and then says: &nbsp;"These old letters is from Harvey
 Wilks; and here's <i>these</i> two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't
 write them" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to
 see how the lawyer had took them in), "and here's <i>this</i> old gentleman's
 hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, <i>he</i> didn't write them?fact
 is, the scratches he makes ain't properly <i>writing</i> at all. &nbsp;Now,
 here's some letters from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The new old gentleman says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you please, let me explain. &nbsp;Nobody can read my hand but my
 brother there?so he copies for me. &nbsp;It's <i>his</i> hand you've got
 there, not mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Well</i>!" says the lawyer, "this <i>is</i> a state of things. &nbsp;I've got some
 of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we
 can com?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He <i>can't</i> write with his left hand," says the old gentleman. &nbsp;"If he
 could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and
 mine too. &nbsp;Look at both, please?they're by the same hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lawyer done it, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I believe it's so?and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger
 resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. &nbsp;Well, well, well!
 &nbsp;I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to
 grass, partly. &nbsp;But anyway, one thing is proved?<i>these</i> two ain't
 either of 'em Wilkses"?and he wagged his head towards the king and
 the duke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, what do you think? &nbsp;That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in
 <i>then</i>! Indeed he wouldn't. &nbsp;Said it warn't no fair test. &nbsp;Said
 his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried
 to write?<i>he</i> see William was going to play one of his jokes the
 minute he put the pen to paper. &nbsp;And so he warmed up and went
 warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe
 what he was saying <i>himself</i>; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've thought of something. &nbsp;Is there anybody here that helped to lay
 out my br?helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner done it. &nbsp;We're both here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a squshed
 down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so
 sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most
 <i>anybody</i> sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice,
 because how was <i>he</i> going to know what was tattooed on the man? &nbsp;He
 whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there,
 and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. &nbsp;Says I to
 myself, <i>now</i> he'll throw up the sponge?there ain't no more use.
 &nbsp;Well, did he? &nbsp;A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.
 &nbsp;I reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people
 out, so they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get
 away. &nbsp;Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mf! &nbsp;It's a <i>very</i> tough question, <i>ain't</i> it! &nbsp;<i>yes</i>, sir, I k'n
 tell you what's tattooed on his breast. &nbsp;It's jest a small, thin,
 blue arrow?that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't
 see it. &nbsp;<i>now</i> what do you say?hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
 cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his
 eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king <i>this</i> time, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There?you've heard what he said! &nbsp;Was there any such mark on
 Peter Wilks' breast?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both of them spoke up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We didn't see no such mark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good!" says the old gentleman. &nbsp;"Now, what you <i>did</i> see on his breast
 was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
 young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: &nbsp;P?B?W"?and
 he marked them that way on a piece of paper. &nbsp;"Come, ain't that what
 you saw?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both of them spoke up again, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, we <i>didn't</i>. &nbsp;We never seen any marks at all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, everybody <i>was</i> in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The whole <i>bilin</i>' of 'm 's frauds! &nbsp;Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!
 le's ride 'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at once, and there
 was a rattling powwow. &nbsp;But the lawyer he jumps on the table and
 yells, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen?gentle<i>men!</i> &nbsp;Hear me just a word?just a <i>single</i>
 word?if you <i>please</i>! &nbsp;There's one way yet?let's go and dig
 up the corpse and look."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That took them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and
 the doctor sung out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on, hold on! &nbsp;Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
 <i>them</i> along, too!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don't find them marks we'll
 lynch the whole gang!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I <i>was</i> scared, now, I tell you. &nbsp;But there warn't no getting away, you
 know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
 graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town
 at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
 evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;
 because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and
 blow on our dead-beats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
 wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
 lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
 the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was
 in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what
 I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I
 wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me
 and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world
 betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. &nbsp;If they
 didn't find them?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think
 about nothing else. &nbsp;It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
 time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist?Hines?and
 a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. &nbsp;He dragged me
 right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
 like an overflow. &nbsp;And when they got to the grave they found they had
 about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't
 thought to fetch a lantern. &nbsp;But they sailed into digging anyway by
 the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half
 a mile off, to borrow one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
 started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
 brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no
 notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could
 see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of
 dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it
 all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
 such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge
 in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was
 awful. &nbsp;Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I
 reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and
 somebody sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give
 a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and
 shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew?leastways, I had it
 all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
 buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
 the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I
 never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main
 one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it.
 No light there; the house all dark?which made me feel sorry and
 disappointed, I didn't know why. &nbsp;But at last, just as I was sailing
 by, <i>flash</i> comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up
 sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me
 in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.
 She <i>was</i> the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
 towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time
 the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved.
 It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. &nbsp;The
 towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of
 the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I
 was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could
 afforded it. &nbsp;But I didn't. &nbsp;As I sprung aboard I sung out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! &nbsp;Glory be to goodness, we're
 shut of them!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full
 of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my
 mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear
 and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights
 out of me. &nbsp;But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless
 me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and
 the duke, but I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! &nbsp;Cut loose
 and let her slide!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it <i>did</i> seem
 so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody
 to bother us. &nbsp;I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my
 heels a few times?I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I
 noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened
 and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the
 water, here they come!?and just a-laying to their oars and making
 their skiff hum! &nbsp;It was the king and the duke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all
 I could do to keep from crying.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! &nbsp;Tired of our company,
 hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, your majesty, we warn't?<i>please</i> don't, your majesty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick, then, and tell us what <i>was</i> your idea, or I'll shake the insides
 out o' you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
 &nbsp;The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying
 he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to
 see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise
 by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and
 whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. &nbsp;It
 didn't seem no good for <i>me</i> to stay?I couldn't do nothing, and I
 didn't want to be hung if I could get away. &nbsp;So I never stopped
 running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
 or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke
 wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful
 glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, "Oh, yes,
 it's <i>mighty</i> likely!" and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd
 drownd me. &nbsp;But the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leggo the boy, you old idiot! &nbsp;Would <i>you</i> a done any different?
 &nbsp;Did you inquire around for <i>him</i> when you got loose? &nbsp;I don't
 remember it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.
 But the duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You better a blame' sight give <i>yourself</i> a good cussing, for you're the
 one that's entitled to it most. &nbsp;You hain't done a thing from the
 start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with
 that imaginary blue-arrow mark. &nbsp;That <i>was</i> bright?it was right
 down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. &nbsp;For if it hadn't
 been for that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come?and
 then?the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the
 graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
 excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look
 we'd a slept in our cravats to-night?cravats warranted to <i>wear</i>, too?longer
 than <i>we'd</i> need 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They was still a minute?thinking; then the king says, kind of
 absent-minded like:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mf! &nbsp;And we reckoned the <i>niggers</i> stole it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That made me squirm!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, "<i>we</i> did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leastways, I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says, the same way:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the contrary, I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says, pretty brisk:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was <i>you</i> referring
 to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't know?maybe you
 was asleep, and didn't know what you was about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke bristles up now, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, let <i>up</i> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
 Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Yes</i>, sir! &nbsp;I know you <i>do</i> know, because you done it yourself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie!"?and the duke went for him. &nbsp;The king sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take y'r hands off!?leggo my throat!?I take it all back!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you just own up, first, that you <i>did</i> hide that money there,
 intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it
 up, and have it all to yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait jest a minute, duke?answer me this one question, honest and
 fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and
 take back everything I said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. &nbsp;There, now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, I b'lieve you. &nbsp;But answer me only jest this one more?now
 <i>don't</i> git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't care if I <i>did</i>, I didn't <i>do</i> it, anyway. &nbsp;But you not
 only had it in mind to do it, but you <i>done</i> it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. &nbsp;I won't
 say I warn't goin' to do it, because I <i>was</i>; but you?I mean somebody?got
 in ahead o' me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie! &nbsp;You done it, and you got to <i>say</i> you done it, or?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Nough!?I <i>own up!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
 than what I was feeling before. &nbsp;So the duke took his hands off and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. &nbsp;It's <i>well</i> for you to set
 there and blubber like a baby?it's fitten for you, after the way
 you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
 everything?and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
 father. &nbsp;You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear
 it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.
 &nbsp;It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to <i>believe</i>
 that rubbage. &nbsp;Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
 up the deffisit?you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the
 Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it <i>all</i>!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dry up! &nbsp;I don't want to hear no more out of you!" says the duke.
 &nbsp;"And <i>now</i> you see what you GOT by it. &nbsp;They've got all their own
 money back, and all of <i>ourn</i> but a shekel or two <i>besides</i>. &nbsp;G'long to
 bed, and don't you deffersit <i>me</i> no more deffersits, long 's <i>you</i> live!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
 and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
 hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
 lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. &nbsp;They
 both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough
 to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. &nbsp;That
 made me feel easy and satisfied. &nbsp;Of course when they got to snoring
 we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down
 the river. &nbsp;We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
 long ways from home. &nbsp;We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
 them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. &nbsp;It was the
 first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal.
 &nbsp;So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to
 work the villages again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for
 them both to get drunk on. &nbsp;Then in another village they started a
 dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
 does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
 pranced them out of town. &nbsp;Another time they tried to go at
 yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and
 give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. &nbsp;They tackled
 missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a
 little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. &nbsp;So at
 last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
 floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
 half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
 the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim
 and me got uneasy. &nbsp;We didn't like the look of it. &nbsp;We judged
 they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. &nbsp;We
 turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going
 to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the
 counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared,
 and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do
 with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them
 the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one
 morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a
 little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went
 ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt
 around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
 ("House to rob, you <i>mean</i>," says I to myself; "and when you get through
 robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim
 and the raft?and you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he
 said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all
 right, and we was to come along.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we stayed where we was. &nbsp;The duke he fretted and sweated around,
 and was in a mighty sour way. &nbsp;He scolded us for everything, and we
 couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
 Something was a-brewing, sure. &nbsp;I was good and glad when midday come
 and no king; we could have a change, anyway?and maybe a chance for
 <i>the</i> change on top of it. &nbsp;So me and the duke went up to the village,
 and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
 back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
 bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
 his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them.
 &nbsp;The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun
 to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the
 reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I
 see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before
 they ever see me and Jim again. &nbsp;I got down there all out of breath
 but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. &nbsp;Jim
 was gone! &nbsp;I set up a shout?and then another?and then
 another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and
 screeching; but it warn't no use?old Jim was gone. &nbsp;Then I set
 down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I couldn't set still long. &nbsp;Pretty
 soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run
 across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed
 so and so, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whereabouts?" says I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. &nbsp;He's a runaway
 nigger, and they've got him. &nbsp;Was you looking for him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet I ain't! &nbsp;I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
 ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out?and told me to
 lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. &nbsp;Been there ever since;
 afeard to come out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him. He
 run off f'm down South, som'ers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a good job they got him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I <i>reckon</i>! &nbsp;There's two hunderd dollars reward on him. &nbsp;It's
 like picking up money out'n the road."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is?and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him
 <i>first</i>. Who nailed him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was an old fellow?a stranger?and he sold out his chance in
 him for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.
 &nbsp;Think o' that, now! &nbsp;You bet <i>I'd</i> wait, if it was seven year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's me, every time," says I. &nbsp;"But maybe his chance ain't worth
 no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. &nbsp;Maybe there's
 something ain't straight about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it <i>is</i>, though?straight as a string. &nbsp;I see the handbill
 myself. &nbsp;It tells all about him, to a dot?paints him like a
 picture, and tells the plantation he's frum, below Newr<i>leans</i>. &nbsp;No-sirree-<i>bob</i>,
 they ain't no trouble 'bout <i>that</i> speculation, you bet you. &nbsp;Say,
 gimme a chaw tobacker, won't ye?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't have none, so he left. &nbsp;I went to the raft, and set down in
 the wigwam to think. &nbsp;But I couldn't come to nothing. &nbsp;I thought
 till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.
 &nbsp;After all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them
 scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and
 ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as
 that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,
 for forty dirty dollars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a
 slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd <i>got</i> to be a slave, and
 so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss
 Watson where he was. &nbsp;But I soon give up that notion for two things:
 she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving
 her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if she
 didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make
 Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then
 think of <i>me</i>! &nbsp;It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger
 to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again
 I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. &nbsp;That's just
 the way: &nbsp;a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to
 take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain't no
 disgrace. &nbsp;That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the
 more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down
 and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden
 that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
 letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there
 in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't
 ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on
 the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go
 only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so
 scared. &nbsp;Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up
 somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so
 much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the
 Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a
 learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that
 nigger goes to everlasting fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It made me shiver. &nbsp;And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
 couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. &nbsp;So
 I kneeled down. &nbsp;But the words wouldn't come. &nbsp;Why wouldn't
 they? &nbsp;It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. &nbsp;Nor from
 <i>me</i>, neither. &nbsp;I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. &nbsp;It was
 because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was
 because I was playing double. &nbsp;I was letting <i>on</i> to give up sin, but
 away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. &nbsp;I was
 trying to make my mouth <i>say</i> I would do the right thing and the clean
 thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but
 deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. &nbsp;You can't
 pray a lie?I found that out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.
 At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter?and
 then see if I can pray. &nbsp;Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
 light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. &nbsp;So
 I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
 and wrote:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
 Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
 reward if you send.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>Huck Finn.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt
 so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. &nbsp;But I didn't do it
 straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking?thinking
 how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
 and going to hell. &nbsp;And went on thinking. &nbsp;And got to thinking
 over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: &nbsp;in
 the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and
 we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. &nbsp;But somehow I
 couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
 other kind. &nbsp;I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
 calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I
 come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up
 there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me
 honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good
 he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the
 men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the
 best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the <i>only</i> one he's got now;
 and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a close place. &nbsp;I took it up, and held it in my hand. &nbsp;I
 was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,
 and I knowed it. &nbsp;I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and
 then says to myself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, then, I'll <i>go</i> to hell"?and tore it up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. &nbsp;And I let
 them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. &nbsp;I shoved
 the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
 which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. &nbsp;And
 for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and
 if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long
 as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
 considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited
 me. &nbsp;So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the
 river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft
 and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. &nbsp;I slept the
 night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and
 put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another
 in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. &nbsp;I landed
 below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
 and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
 sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
 of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,
 "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three
 hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody
 around, though it was good daylight now. &nbsp;But I didn't mind, because
 I didn't want to see nobody just yet?I only wanted to get the lay of
 the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the
 village, not from below. &nbsp;So I just took a look, and shoved along,
 straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the
 duke. &nbsp;He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch?three-night
 performance?like that other time. &nbsp;They had the cheek, them
 frauds! &nbsp;I was right on him before I could shirk. &nbsp;He looked
 astonished, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hel-<i>lo</i>! &nbsp;Where'd <i>you</i> come from?" &nbsp;Then he says, kind of glad
 and eager, "Where's the raft??got her in a good place?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was your idea for asking <i>me</i>?" he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to
 myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went
 a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. &nbsp;A man up and
 offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to
 fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the
 boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove
 him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
 him. &nbsp;We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
 country till we tired him out. &nbsp;We never got him till dark; then we
 fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. &nbsp;When I got there
 and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had
 to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in
 the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no
 more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and cried.
 &nbsp;I slept in the woods all night. &nbsp;But what <i>did</i> become of the
 raft, then??and Jim?poor Jim!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blamed if I know?that is, what's become of the raft. &nbsp;That old
 fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the
 doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent
 but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night
 and found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft
 and shook us, and run off down the river.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn't shake my <i>nigger</i>, would I??the only nigger I had in the
 world, and the only property."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We never thought of that. &nbsp;Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider
 him <i>our</i> nigger; yes, we did consider him so?goodness knows we had
 trouble enough for him. &nbsp;So when we see the raft was gone and we flat
 broke, there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
 shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. &nbsp;Where's
 that ten cents? Give it here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend
 it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I
 had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. &nbsp;He never said
 nothing. &nbsp;The next minute he whirls on me and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? &nbsp;We'd skin him if he
 done that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How can he blow? &nbsp;Hain't he run off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! &nbsp;That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the
 money's gone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Sold</i> him?" &nbsp;I says, and begun to cry; "why, he was <i>my</i> nigger, and
 that was my money. &nbsp;Where is he??I want my nigger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you can't <i>get</i> your nigger, that's all?so dry up your
 blubbering. Looky here?do you think <i>you'd</i> venture to blow on us?
 &nbsp;Blamed if I think I'd trust you. &nbsp;Why, if you <i>was</i> to blow on us?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before.
 I went on a-whimpering, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow. I
 got to turn out and find my nigger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
 his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. &nbsp;At last he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell you something. &nbsp;We got to be here three days. &nbsp;If
 you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell
 you where to find him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I promised, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A farmer by the name of Silas Ph?" and then he stopped. &nbsp;You
 see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and
 begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.
 &nbsp;And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of
 having me out of the way the whole three days. &nbsp;So pretty soon he
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The man that bought him is named Abram Foster?Abram G. Foster?and
 he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days. &nbsp;And I'll start
 this very afternoon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No you wont, you'll start <i>now</i>; and don't you lose any time about it,
 neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. &nbsp;Just keep a tight tongue in
 your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with
 <i>us</i>, d'ye hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. &nbsp;I
 wanted to be left free to work my plans.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
 to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim <i>is</i> your nigger?some
 idiots don't require documents?leastways I've heard there's such
 down South here. &nbsp;And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's
 bogus, maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was
 for getting 'em out. &nbsp;Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want
 to; but mind you don't work your jaw any <i>between</i> here and there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I left, and struck for the back country. &nbsp;I didn't look around,
 but I kinder felt like he was watching me. &nbsp;But I knowed I could tire
 him out at that. &nbsp;I went straight out in the country as much as a
 mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards
 Phelps'. &nbsp;I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off
 without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these
 fellows could get away. &nbsp;I didn't want no trouble with their kind.
 &nbsp;I'd seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of
 them.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
 the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
 dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
 like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the
 leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits
 whispering?spirits that's been dead ever so many years?and you
 always think they're talking about <i>you</i>. &nbsp;As a general thing it makes
 a body wish <i>he</i> was dead, too, and done with it all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all
 look alike. &nbsp;A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of
 logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length,
 to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are
 going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard,
 but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed
 off; big double log-house for the white folks?hewed logs, with the
 chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
 whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,
 open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of
 the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the
 smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back
 fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and
 big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,
 with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more
 hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;
 some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;
 outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton
 fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started
 for the kitchen. &nbsp;When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a
 spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I
 knowed for certain I wished I was dead?for that <i>is</i> the lonesomest
 sound in the whole world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
 to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
 I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
 I left it alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for
 me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. &nbsp;And such
 another powwow as they made! &nbsp;In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
 of a hub of a wheel, as you may say?spokes made out of dogs?circle
 of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
 stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
 could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
 hand, singing out, "Begone <i>you</i> Tige! you Spot! begone sah!" and she
 fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
 and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
 wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. &nbsp;There
 ain't no harm in a hound, nohow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys
 without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
 mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they
 always do. &nbsp;And here comes the white woman running from the house,
 about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in
 her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same
 way the little niggers was doing. &nbsp;She was smiling all over so she
 could hardly stand?and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's <i>you</i>, at last!?<i>ain't</i> it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and
 shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and
 she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, "You don't
 look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I
 don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you! &nbsp;Dear, dear, it does
 seem like I could eat you up! &nbsp;Children, it's your cousin Tom!?tell
 him howdy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
 hid behind her. &nbsp;So she run on:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away?or did you
 get your breakfast on the boat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said I had got it on the boat. &nbsp;So then she started for the house,
 leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. &nbsp;When we got
 there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a
 little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now I can have a <i>good</i> look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for
 it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come at last!
 We been expecting you a couple of days and more. &nbsp;What kep' you??boat
 get aground?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes'm?she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't say yes'm?say Aunt Sally. &nbsp;Where'd she get aground?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat
 would be coming up the river or down. &nbsp;But I go a good deal on
 instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up?from down
 towards Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the
 names of bars down that way. &nbsp;I see I'd got to invent a bar, or
 forget the name of the one we got aground on?or?Now I struck
 an idea, and fetched it out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It warn't the grounding?that didn't keep us back but a little.
 &nbsp;We blowed out a cylinder-head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good gracious! anybody hurt?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No'm. &nbsp;Killed a nigger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. &nbsp;Two years
 ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the
 old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.
 &nbsp;And I think he died afterwards. &nbsp;He was a Baptist. &nbsp;Your
 uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very
 well. &nbsp;Yes, I remember now, he <i>did</i> die. &nbsp;Mortification set in,
 and they had to amputate him. But it didn't save him. &nbsp;Yes, it was
 mortification?that was it. &nbsp;He turned blue all over, and died
 in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look
 at. &nbsp;Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you. And
 he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You
 must a met him on the road, didn't you??oldish man, with a?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. &nbsp;The boat landed just at
 daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around
 the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get
 here too soon; and so I come down the back way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who'd you give the baggage to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, child, it 'll be stole!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
 to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'
 lunch, and give me all I wanted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. &nbsp;I had my mind on the
 children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
 a little, and find out who I was. &nbsp;But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.
 Phelps kept it up and run on so. &nbsp;Pretty soon she made the cold
 chills streak all down my back, because she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word about
 Sis, nor any of them. &nbsp;Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start
 up yourn; just tell me <i>everything</i>?tell me all about 'm all every one
 of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told you to
 tell me; and every last thing you can think of."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I see I was up a stump?and up it good. &nbsp;Providence had
 stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.
 &nbsp;I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead?I'd got to
 throw up my hand. &nbsp;So I says to myself, here's another place where I
 got to resk the truth. &nbsp;I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed
 me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here he comes! &nbsp;Stick your head down lower?there, that'll do;
 you can't be seen now. &nbsp;Don't you let on you're here. &nbsp;I'll play
 a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see I was in a fix now. &nbsp;But it warn't no use to worry; there
 warn't nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand
 from under when the lightning struck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
 the bed hid him. &nbsp;Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has he come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," says her husband.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-<i>ness</i> gracious!" she says, "what in the warld can have become of
 him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it makes me
 dreadful uneasy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted! &nbsp;He <i>must</i> a come; and
 you've missed him along the road. &nbsp;I <i>know</i> it's so?something
 tells me so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Sally, I <i>couldn't</i> miss him along the road?<i>you</i> know that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But oh, dear, dear, what <i>will</i> Sis say! &nbsp;He must a come! &nbsp;You
 must a missed him. &nbsp;He?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. &nbsp;I don't
 know what in the world to make of it. &nbsp;I'm at my wit's end, and I
 don't mind acknowledging 't I'm right down scared. &nbsp;But there's no
 hope that he's come; for he <i>couldn't</i> come and me miss him. &nbsp;Sally,
 it's terrible?just terrible?something's happened to the boat,
 sure!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Silas! &nbsp;Look yonder!?up the road!?ain't that
 somebody coming?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps
 the chance she wanted. &nbsp;She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed
 and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
 window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I
 standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. &nbsp;The old gentleman stared,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, who's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who do you reckon 't is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't no idea. &nbsp;Who <i>is</i> it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's <i>Tom Sawyer!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By jings, I most slumped through the floor! &nbsp;But there warn't no time
 to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
 shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
 cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
 and the rest of the tribe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like
 being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. &nbsp;Well, they
 froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it
 couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family?I
 mean the Sawyer family?than ever happened to any six Sawyer
 families. &nbsp;And I explained all about how we blowed out a
 cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to
 fix it. &nbsp;Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because <i>they</i>
 didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it. &nbsp;If I'd a
 called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
 uncomfortable all up the other. &nbsp;Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
 comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
 steamboat coughing along down the river. &nbsp;Then I says to myself,
 s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? &nbsp;And s'pose he steps in
 here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to
 keep quiet?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I couldn't <i>have</i> it that way; it wouldn't do at all. &nbsp;I must go
 up the road and waylay him. &nbsp;So I told the folks I reckoned I would
 go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. &nbsp;The old gentleman was
 for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself,
 and I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon
 coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till
 he come along. &nbsp;I says "Hold on!" and it stopped alongside, and his
 mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three
 times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't ever done you no harm. &nbsp;You know that. &nbsp;So, then, what
 you want to come back and ha'nt <i>me</i> for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't come back?I hain't been <i>gone</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite
 satisfied yet. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you. &nbsp;Honest
 injun now, you ain't a ghost?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Honest injun, I ain't," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?I?I?well, that ought to settle it, of course; but
 I can't somehow seem to understand it no way. &nbsp;Looky here, warn't you
 ever murdered <i>at all?</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. &nbsp;I warn't ever murdered at all?I played it on them. &nbsp;You
 come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again
 he didn't know what to do. &nbsp;And he wanted to know all about it right
 off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him
 where he lived. &nbsp;But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told
 his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the
 kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? &nbsp;He
 said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. &nbsp;So he thought
 and thought, and pretty soon he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's all right; I've got it. &nbsp;Take my trunk in your wagon, and let
 on it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
 house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and
 take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
 and you needn't let on to know me at first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right; but wait a minute. &nbsp;There's one more thing?a thing
 that <i>nobody</i> don't know but me. &nbsp;And that is, there's a nigger here
 that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is <i>Jim</i>?old
 Miss Watson's Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! &nbsp;Why, Jim is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped and went to studying. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know what you'll say. &nbsp;You'll say it's dirty, low-down business;
 but what if it is? &nbsp;I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I
 want you keep mum and not let on. &nbsp;Will you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His eye lit up, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll <i>help</i> you steal him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. &nbsp;It was the most
 astonishing speech I ever heard?and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
 considerable in my estimation. &nbsp;Only I couldn't believe it. &nbsp;Tom
 Sawyer a <i>nigger-stealer!</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, shucks!" &nbsp;I says; "you're joking."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ain't joking, either."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
 about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that <i>you</i> don't know
 nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way
 and I drove mine. &nbsp;But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
 accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
 quick for that length of a trip. &nbsp;The old gentleman was at the door,
 and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, this is wonderful! &nbsp;Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
 to do it? &nbsp;I wish we'd a timed her. &nbsp;And she hain't sweated a
 hair?not a hair. It's wonderful. &nbsp;Why, I wouldn't take a
 hundred dollars for that horse now?I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a
 sold her for fifteen before, and thought 'twas all she was worth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That's all he said. &nbsp;He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever
 see. But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he
 was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of
 the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
 and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
 worth it, too. &nbsp;There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that,
 and done the same way, down South.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
 Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
 yards, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, there's somebody come! &nbsp;I wonder who 'tis? &nbsp;Why, I do
 believe it's a stranger. &nbsp;Jimmy" (that's one of the children) "run
 and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
 don't come <i>every</i> year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest,
 when he does come. &nbsp;Tom was over the stile and starting for the
 house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all
 bunched in the front door. &nbsp;Tom had his store clothes on, and an
 audience?and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. &nbsp;In them
 circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style
 that was suitable. &nbsp;He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like
 a sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. &nbsp;When he got
 a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was
 the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to
 disturb them, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't your driver has
 deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more. Come
 in, come in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too late?he's
 out of sight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us;
 and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I <i>can't</i> make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. &nbsp;I'll
 walk?I don't mind the distance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But we won't <i>let</i> you walk?it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do
 it. Come right in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>do</i>," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in
 the world. &nbsp;You must stay. &nbsp;It's a long, dusty three mile, and
 we can't let you walk. &nbsp;And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on
 another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. &nbsp;Come
 right in and make yourself at home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
 persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
 Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson?and he made
 another bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
 everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
 wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
 still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
 mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going
 on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You owdacious puppy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked kind of hurt, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm surprised at you, m'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're s'rp?Why, what do you reckon I am? &nbsp;I've a good notion
 to take and?Say, what do you mean by kissing me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked kind of humble, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't mean nothing, m'am. &nbsp;I didn't mean no harm. &nbsp;I?I?thought
 you'd like it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you born fool!" &nbsp;She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
 like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
 &nbsp;"What made you think I'd like it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't know. &nbsp;Only, they?they?told me you would."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>They</i> told you I would. &nbsp;Whoever told you's <i>another</i> lunatic. &nbsp;I
 never heard the beat of it. &nbsp;Who's <i>they</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, everybody. &nbsp;They all said so, m'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers
 worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's 'everybody'? &nbsp;Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot
 short."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. &nbsp;They told me to. &nbsp;They
 all told me to. &nbsp;They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.
 &nbsp;They all said it?every one of them. &nbsp;But I'm sorry, m'am,
 and I won't do it no more?I won't, honest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You won't, won't you? &nbsp;Well, I sh'd <i>reckon</i> you won't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again?till you ask
 me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till I <i>ask</i> you! &nbsp;Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
 &nbsp;I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I
 ask you?or the likes of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he says, "it does surprise me so. &nbsp;I can't make it out,
 somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. &nbsp;But?"
 He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a
 friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says,
 "Didn't <i>you</i> think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, no; I?I?well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tom, didn't <i>you</i> think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid
 Sawyer?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you impudent young
 rascal, to fool a body so?" and was going to hug him, but he fended
 her off, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, not till you've asked me first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him
 over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took
 what was left. &nbsp;And after they got a little quiet again she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. &nbsp;We warn't looking for
 <i>you</i> at all, but only Tom. &nbsp;Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming
 but him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because it warn't <i>intended</i> for any of us to come but Tom," he says;
 "but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so,
 coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate
 surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by
 tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. &nbsp;But it was a
 mistake, Aunt Sally. &nbsp;This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to
 come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?not impudent whelps, Sid. &nbsp;You ought to had your jaws
 boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when. &nbsp;But I don't
 care, I don't mind the terms?I'd be willing to stand a thousand such
 jokes to have you here. Well, to think of that performance! &nbsp;I don't
 deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that
 smack."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
 kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families?and
 all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in
 a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the
 morning. &nbsp;Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it
 was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them
 kind of interruptions do lots of times. &nbsp;There was a considerable
 good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all
 the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say nothing about
 any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. &nbsp;But
 at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you
 couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me
 all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people;
 so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
 time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So there it was!?but I couldn't help it. &nbsp;Tom and me was to
 sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and
 went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down
 the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody
 was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry
 up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
 and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and
 what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
 Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time
 to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it
 was as much as half-after eight, then?here comes a raging rush of
 people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
 pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and
 as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail?that
 is, I knowed it <i>was</i> the king and the duke, though they was all over tar
 and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human?just
 looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. &nbsp;Well, it made
 me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it
 seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the
 world. &nbsp;It was a dreadful thing to see. &nbsp;Human beings <i>can</i> be
 awful cruel to one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We see we was too late?couldn't do no good. &nbsp;We asked some
 stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
 innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
 middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
 the house rose up and went for them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was
 before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow?though
 I hadn't done nothing. &nbsp;But that's always the way; it don't make no
 difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got
 no sense, and just goes for him anyway. &nbsp;If I had a yaller dog that
 didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him. It
 takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't
 no good, nohow. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer he says the same.

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. &nbsp;By and by Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! &nbsp;I
 bet I know where Jim is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! &nbsp;Where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In that hut down by the ash-hopper. &nbsp;Why, looky here. &nbsp;When we
 was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you think the vittles was for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For a dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because part of it was watermelon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So it was?I noticed it. &nbsp;Well, it does beat all that I never
 thought about a dog not eating watermelon. &nbsp;It shows how a body can
 see and don't see at the same time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
 again when he came out. &nbsp;He fetched uncle a key about the time we got
 up from table?same key, I bet. &nbsp;Watermelon shows man, lock
 shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little
 plantation, and where the people's all so kind and good. &nbsp;Jim's the
 prisoner. &nbsp;All right?I'm glad we found it out detective
 fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any other way. &nbsp;Now you work your
 mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too;
 and we'll take the one we like the best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What a head for just a boy to have! &nbsp;If I had Tom Sawyer's head I
 wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in
 a circus, nor nothing I can think of. &nbsp;I went to thinking out a plan,
 but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
 plan was going to come from. &nbsp;Pretty soon Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ready?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?bring it out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My plan is this," I says. &nbsp;"We can easy find out if it's Jim in
 there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from
 the island. &nbsp;Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out
 of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the
 river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me
 and Jim used to do before. &nbsp;Wouldn't that plan work?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Work</i>? &nbsp;Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. &nbsp;But
 it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing <i>to</i> it. &nbsp;What's the good
 of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that? &nbsp;It's as mild as
 goose-milk. &nbsp;Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking
 into a soap factory."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but I
 knowed mighty well that whenever he got <i>his</i> plan ready it wouldn't have
 none of them objections to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And it didn't. &nbsp;He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
 worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as
 mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. &nbsp;So I was satisfied,
 and said we would waltz in on it. &nbsp;I needn't tell what it was here,
 because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. &nbsp;I knowed he would
 be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
 bullinesses wherever he got a chance. &nbsp;And that is what he done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
 earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
 That was the thing that was too many for me. &nbsp;Here was a boy that was
 respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
 home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
 knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
 without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this
 business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
 everybody. &nbsp;I <i>couldn't</i> understand it no way at all. &nbsp;It was
 outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his
 true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
 himself. And I <i>did</i> start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? &nbsp;Don't I generly know what
 I'm about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't I <i>say</i> I was going to help steal the nigger?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Well</i>, then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That's all he said, and that's all I said. &nbsp;It warn't no use to say
 any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. &nbsp;But
 I couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
 let it go, and never bothered no more about it. &nbsp;If he was bound to
 have it so, I couldn't help it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
 the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. &nbsp;We went through the
 yard so as to see what the hounds would do. &nbsp;They knowed us, and
 didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything
 comes by in the night. &nbsp;When we got to the cabin we took a look at
 the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with?which
 was the north side?we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,
 with just one stout board nailed across it. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's the ticket. &nbsp;This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if
 we wrench off the board."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing
 hooky. &nbsp;I should <i>hope</i> we can find a way that's a little more
 complicated than <i>that</i>, Huck Finn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done before
 I was murdered that time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's more <i>like</i>," he says. &nbsp;"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,
 and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
 &nbsp;There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined
 the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. &nbsp;It was as long as
 the hut, but narrow?only about six foot wide. &nbsp;The door to it
 was at the south end, and was padlocked. &nbsp;Tom he went to the
 soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift
 the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. &nbsp;The
 chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and
 struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't
 no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing
 in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a
 crippled plow. &nbsp;The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the
 staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.
 &nbsp;He says;
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now we're all right. &nbsp;We'll <i>dig</i> him out. &nbsp;It 'll take about a
 week!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door?you only
 have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors?but
 that warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he
 must climb up the lightning-rod. &nbsp;But after he got up half way about
 three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
 busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he was
 rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time
 he made the trip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to
 pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim?if it <i>was</i>
 Jim that was being fed. &nbsp;The niggers was just getting through
 breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a
 tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving,
 the key come from the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all
 tied up in little bunches with thread. &nbsp;That was to keep witches off.
 &nbsp;He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making
 him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words
 and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in
 his life. &nbsp;He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his
 troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. &nbsp;So Tom
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the vittles for? &nbsp;Going to feed the dogs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
 heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. &nbsp;Cur'us dog, too. &nbsp;Does you want to go en
 look at 'im?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I hunched Tom, and whispers:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You going, right here in the daybreak? &nbsp;<i>that</i> warn't the plan."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it warn't; but it's the plan <i>now</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. &nbsp;When we got
 in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there,
 sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, <i>Huck</i>! &nbsp;En good <i>lan</i>'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. &nbsp;I didn't know
 nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger
 busted in and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We could see pretty well now. &nbsp;Tom he looked at the nigger, steady
 and kind of wondering, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does <i>who</i> know us?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What <i>put</i> it dar? &nbsp;Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's mighty curious. &nbsp;<i>Who</i> sung out? <i>when</i> did he sing out?
 &nbsp;<i>what</i> did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,
 "Did <i>you</i> hear anybody sing out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you sing out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not a word?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah, I hain't said a word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you ever see us before?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah; not as I knows on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
 says, kind of severe:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? &nbsp;What made you
 think somebody sung out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. &nbsp;Dey's
 awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. &nbsp;Please
 to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase
 he say dey <i>ain't</i> no witches. &nbsp;I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now?<i>den</i>
 what would he say! &nbsp;I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun'
 it <i>dis</i> time. &nbsp;But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's <i>sot</i>, stays sot;
 dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when <i>you</i> fine
 it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to buy
 some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. &nbsp;If I was to
 catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him
 up, I'd hang him." &nbsp;And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look
 at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't ever let on to know us. &nbsp;And if you hear any digging going on
 nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
 come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us
 to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
 witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
 around then.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
 into the woods; because Tom said we got to have <i>some</i> light to see how to
 dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what
 we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and
 just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. &nbsp;We
 fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom
 says, kind of dissatisfied:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And
 so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. &nbsp;There
 ain't no watchman to be drugged?now there <i>ought</i> to be a watchman.
 &nbsp;There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. &nbsp;And
 there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
 bed: &nbsp;why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
 the chain. &nbsp;And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
 punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. &nbsp;Jim
 could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no
 use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. &nbsp;Why, drat it,
 Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent <i>all</i> the
 difficulties. &nbsp;Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can
 with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing?there's more
 honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where
 there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their
 duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own
 head. &nbsp;Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. &nbsp;When you
 come down to the cold facts, we simply got to <i>let on</i> that a lantern's
 resky. &nbsp;Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted
 to, I believe. &nbsp;Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up
 something to make a saw out of the first chance we get."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do we want of a saw?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do we <i>want</i> of it? &nbsp;Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed
 off, so as to get the chain loose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
 off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. &nbsp;You <i>can</i> get up the
 infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. &nbsp;Why, hain't you ever
 read any books at all??Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto
 Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? &nbsp;Who ever heard of
 getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? &nbsp;No; the
 way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave
 it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some
 dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't
 see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly
 sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes;
 slip off your chain, and there you are. &nbsp;Nothing to do but hitch your
 rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat?because
 a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know?and there's your
 horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across
 a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever
 it is. It's gaudy, Huck. &nbsp;I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If
 we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under
 the cabin?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he never heard me. &nbsp;He had forgot me and everything else. &nbsp;He
 had his chin in his hand, thinking. &nbsp;Pretty soon he sighs and shakes
 his head; then sighs again, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it wouldn't do?there ain't necessity enough for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For what?" &nbsp;I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good land!" &nbsp;I says; "why, there ain't <i>no</i> necessity for it. &nbsp;And
 what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, some of the best authorities has done it. &nbsp;They couldn't get
 the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. &nbsp;And a leg
 would be better still. &nbsp;But we got to let that go. &nbsp;There ain't
 necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't
 understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll
 let it go. &nbsp;But there's one thing?he can have a rope ladder; we
 can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. &nbsp;And
 we can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. &nbsp;And I've
 et worse pies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use for a rope
 ladder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He <i>has</i> got use for it. &nbsp;How <i>you</i> talk, you better say; you don't know
 nothing about it. &nbsp;He's <i>got</i> to have a rope ladder; they all do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What in the nation can he <i>do</i> with it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Do</i> with it? &nbsp;He can hide it in his bed, can't he?" &nbsp;That's what
 they all do; and <i>he's</i> got to, too. &nbsp;Huck, you don't ever seem to want
 to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all
 the time. S'pose he <i>don't</i> do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,
 for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?
 &nbsp;Of course they will. &nbsp;And you wouldn't leave them any? &nbsp;That
 would be a <i>pretty</i> howdy-do, <i>wouldn't</i> it! &nbsp;I never heard of such a
 thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have it, all
 right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no regulations;
 but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer?if we go to tearing up our sheets
 to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt
 Sally, just as sure as you're born. &nbsp;Now, the way I look at it, a
 hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is
 just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag
 ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so
 he don't care what kind of a?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still?that's
 what I'D do. &nbsp;Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
 hickry-bark ladder? &nbsp;Why, it's perfectly ridiculous."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice,
 you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He said that would do. &nbsp;And that gave him another idea, and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Borrow a shirt, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Journal your granny?<i>Jim</i> can't write."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "S'pose he <i>can't</i> write?he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if
 we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
 barrel-hoop?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one;
 and quicker, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Prisoners</i> don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens
 out of, you muggins. &nbsp;They <i>always</i> make their pens out of the hardest,
 toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
 that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and
 months and months to file it out, too, because they've got to do it by
 rubbing it on the wall. &nbsp;<i>They</i> wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had
 it. It ain't regular."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort and
 women; the best authorities uses their own blood. &nbsp;Jim can do that;
 and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
 let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of
 a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. &nbsp;The Iron
 Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jim ain't got no tin plates. &nbsp;They feed him in a pan."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That ain't nothing; we can get him some."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't nobody <i>read</i> his plates."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That ain't got anything to <i>do</i> with it, Huck Finn. &nbsp;All <i>he's</i> got to
 do is to write on the plate and throw it out. &nbsp;You don't <i>have</i> to be
 able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner
 writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, blame it all, it ain't the <i>prisoner's</i> plates."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it's <i>somebody's</i> plates, ain't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, spos'n it is? &nbsp;What does the <i>prisoner</i> care whose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. &nbsp;So
 we cleared out for the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
 clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down
 and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. &nbsp;I called it borrowing,
 because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't
 borrowing, it was stealing. &nbsp;He said we was representing prisoners;
 and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
 don't blame them for it, either. &nbsp;It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
 steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and
 so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
 steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out
 of prison with. &nbsp;He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
 different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he
 warn't a prisoner. &nbsp;So we allowed we would steal everything there was
 that come handy. &nbsp;And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
 when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made
 me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
 Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we <i>needed</i>. Well,
 I says, I needed the watermelon. &nbsp;But he said I didn't need it to get
 out of prison with; there's where the difference was. &nbsp;He said if I'd
 a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal
 with, it would a been all right. &nbsp;So I let it go at that, though I
 couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
 down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
 see a chance to hog a watermelon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
 down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried
 the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. &nbsp;By
 and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk.
 &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tools?" &nbsp;I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tools for what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, to dig with. &nbsp;We ain't a-going to <i>gnaw</i> him out, are we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
 nigger out with?" &nbsp;I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Huck Finn, did you <i>ever</i> hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and
 all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
 &nbsp;Now I want to ask you?if you got any reasonableness in you at
 all?what kind of a show would <i>that</i> give him to be a hero? &nbsp;Why,
 they might as well lend him the key and done with it. &nbsp;Picks and
 shovels?why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we
 want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A couple of case-knives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the <i>right</i> way?and
 it's the regular way. &nbsp;And there ain't no <i>other</i> way, that ever I
 heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about
 these things. They always dig out with a case-knife?and not through
 dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock. &nbsp;And it takes them
 weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. &nbsp;Why, look at one
 of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor
 of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was <i>he</i> at it, you
 reckon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, guess."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. &nbsp;A month and a half."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Thirty-seven year</i>?and he come out in China. &nbsp;<i>That's</i> the kind.
 &nbsp;I wish the bottom of <i>this</i> fortress was solid rock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Jim</i> don't know nobody in China."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's <i>that</i> got to do with it? &nbsp;Neither did that other fellow.
 &nbsp;But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. &nbsp;Why can't
 you stick to the main point?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?I don't care where he comes out, so he <i>comes</i> out; and Jim
 don't, either, I reckon. &nbsp;But there's one thing, anyway?Jim's
 too old to be dug out with a case-knife. &nbsp;He won't last."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes he will <i>last</i>, too. &nbsp;You don't reckon it's going to take
 thirty-seven years to dig out through a <i>dirt</i> foundation, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long will it take, Tom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take
 very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. &nbsp;He'll
 hear Jim ain't from there. &nbsp;Then his next move will be to advertise
 Jim, or something like that. &nbsp;So we can't resk being as long digging
 him out as we ought to. &nbsp;By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple
 of years; but we can't. &nbsp;Things being so uncertain, what I recommend
 is this: &nbsp;that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after
 that, we can <i>let on</i>, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.
 &nbsp;Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's
 an alarm. &nbsp;Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, there's <i>sense</i> in that," I says. &nbsp;"Letting on don't cost
 nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind
 letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. &nbsp;It wouldn't strain
 me none, after I got my hand in. &nbsp;So I'll mosey along now, and smouch
 a couple of case-knives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out of."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I says,
 "there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
 weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. &nbsp;Run along and
 smouch the knives?three of them." &nbsp;So I done it.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
 lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile
 of fox-fire, and went to work. &nbsp;We cleared everything out of the way,
 about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. &nbsp;Tom said
 he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we
 got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any
 hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and
 you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. &nbsp;So we dug
 and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was
 dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done
 anything hardly. &nbsp;At last I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom
 Sawyer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He never said nothing. &nbsp;But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
 digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
 Then he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. &nbsp;If we was
 prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and
 no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
 they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we
 could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and
 the way it ought to be done. &nbsp;But <i>we</i> can't fool along; we got to
 rush; we ain't got no time to spare. &nbsp;If we was to put in another
 night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well?couldn't
 touch a case-knife with them sooner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell you. &nbsp;It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't
 like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: &nbsp;we got to
 dig him out with the picks, and <i>let on</i> it's case-knives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Now</i> you're <i>talking</i>!" &nbsp;I says; "your head gets leveler and leveler
 all the time, Tom Sawyer," I says. &nbsp;"Picks is the thing, moral or no
 moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
 &nbsp;When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a
 Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.
 &nbsp;What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I
 want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's
 the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that
 Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the
 authorities thinks about it nuther."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
 this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by
 and see the rules broke?because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
 and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and
 knows better. &nbsp;It might answer for <i>you</i> to dig Jim out with a pick,
 <i>without</i> any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't
 for me, because I do know better. &nbsp;Gimme a case-knife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. &nbsp;He flung it down, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gimme a <i>case-knife</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't know just what to do?but then I thought. &nbsp;I scratched
 around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he
 took it and went to work, and never said a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was always just that particular. &nbsp;Full of principle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and
 made the fur fly. &nbsp;We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
 long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
 it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his
 level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was
 so sore. &nbsp;At last he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't no use, it can't be done. &nbsp;What you reckon I better do?
 &nbsp;Can't you think of no way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," I says, "but I reckon it ain't regular. &nbsp;Come up the stairs,
 and let on it's a lightning-rod."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he done it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
 for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung
 around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
 plates. &nbsp;Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever
 see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel
 and jimpson weeds under the window-hole?then we could tote them back
 and he could use them over again. &nbsp;So Tom was satisfied. &nbsp;Then
 he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
 of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. &nbsp;By and by he
 said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to
 decide on any of them yet. &nbsp;Said we'd got to post Jim first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one
 of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim
 snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. &nbsp;Then we
 whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the
 job was done. &nbsp;We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and
 pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,
 and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
 and gradual. &nbsp;He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
 honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt
 up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and
 clearing out without losing any time. &nbsp;But Tom he showed him how
 unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and
 how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not
 to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, <i>sure</i>. &nbsp;So
 Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times
 awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle
 Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to
 see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind
 as they could be, Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Now</i> I know how to fix it. &nbsp;We'll send you some things by them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas
 I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on.
 &nbsp;It was his way when he'd got his plans set.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
 large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
 lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we
 would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them out;
 and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her
 apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what
 they was for. &nbsp;And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
 his blood, and all that. He told him everything. &nbsp;Jim he couldn't see
 no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
 better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as
 Tom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
 sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,
 with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. &nbsp;Tom was in high
 spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most
 intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
 it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out;
 for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he
 got used to it. &nbsp;He said that in that way it could be strung out to
 as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. &nbsp;And he
 said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
 candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his
 pocket. &nbsp;Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's
 notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone
 that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would
 work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all
 his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better. Tom
 said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of
 rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know;
 but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into
 it in three or four places first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
 couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on
 piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in
 there to get your breath. &nbsp;By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
 door! &nbsp;The nigger Nat he only just hollered "Witches" once, and
 keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he
 was dying. &nbsp;Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's
 meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and
 back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.
 Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
 asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. &nbsp;He raised
 up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a
 million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
 tracks. &nbsp;I did, mos' sholy. &nbsp;Mars Sid, I <i>felt</i> um?I <i>felt</i>
 um, sah; dey was all over me. &nbsp;Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git
 my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunst?on'y jis' wunst?it's
 all I'd ast. &nbsp;But mos'ly I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I tell you what I think. &nbsp;What makes them come here just at
 this runaway nigger's breakfast-time? &nbsp;It's because they're hungry;
 that's the reason. &nbsp;You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for
 <i>you</i> to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>

 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <br> <br> <br>

 "But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie? &nbsp;I
 doan' know how to make it. &nbsp;I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing
 b'fo'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, I'll have to make it myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you do it, honey??will you? &nbsp;I'll wusshup de groun' und'
 yo' foot, I will!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and
 showed us the runaway nigger. &nbsp;But you got to be mighty careful.
 &nbsp;When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put
 in the pan, don't you let on you see it at all. &nbsp;And don't you look
 when Jim unloads the pan?something might happen, I don't know what.
 &nbsp;And above all, don't you <i>handle</i> the witch-things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Hannel 'M</i>, Mars Sid? &nbsp;What <i>is</i> you a-talkin' 'bout? &nbsp;I wouldn'

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THAT was all fixed. &nbsp;So then we went away and went to the
 rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags,
 and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and
 scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as
 well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it
 full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of
 shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his
 name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in
 Aunt Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we
 stuck in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because
 we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway
 nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped
 the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come
 yet, so we had to wait a little while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly wait
 for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
 and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what <i>has</i>
 become of your other shirt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
 piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
 road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
 children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
 out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
 the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about
 a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half
 price if there was a bidder. &nbsp;But after that we was all right again?it
 was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas
 he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. &nbsp;I know perfectly
 well I took it <i>off</i>, because?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because you hain't got but one <i>on</i>. &nbsp;Just <i>listen</i> at the man! &nbsp;I
 know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
 memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday?I see it
 there myself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and
 you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to
 make a new one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. &nbsp;It
 just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do
 manage to <i>do</i> with 'm all is more'n I can make out. &nbsp;A body 'd think
 you <i>would</i> learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. &nbsp;But it oughtn't to be
 altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing
 to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever
 lost one of them <i>off</i> of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it ain't <i>your</i> fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it if you
 could, I reckon. &nbsp;And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther. &nbsp;Ther's
 a spoon gone; and <i>that</i> ain't all. &nbsp;There was ten, and now ther's only
 nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon,
 <i>that's</i> certain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what else is gone, Sally?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ther's six <i>candles</i> gone?that's what. &nbsp;The rats could a got the
 candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the
 whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do
 it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas?<i>you'd</i>
 never find it out; but you can't lay the <i>spoon</i> on the rats, and that I
 know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but I
 won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. &nbsp;Matilda Angelina Araminta
 <i>Phelps!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
 sugar-bowl without fooling around any. &nbsp;Just then the nigger woman
 steps on to the passage, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Missus, dey's a sheet gone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A <i>sheet</i> gone! &nbsp;Well, for the land's sake!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>do</i> shet up!?s'pose the rats took the <i>sheet</i>? &nbsp;<i>where's</i> it
 gone, Lize?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally. &nbsp;She wuz on de
 clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: &nbsp;she ain' dah no mo' now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon the world <i>is</i> coming to an end. &nbsp;I <i>never</i> see the beat of it
 in all my born days. &nbsp;A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, she was just a-biling. &nbsp;I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
 I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. &nbsp;She
 kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
 everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
 kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. &nbsp;She
 stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I
 was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's <i>just</i> as I expected. &nbsp;So you had it in your pocket all the time;
 and like as not you've got the other things there, too. &nbsp;How'd it get
 there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind of apologizing, "or you know I
 would tell. &nbsp;I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
 breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my
 Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but I'll
 go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put
 it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the
 spoon, and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, for the land's sake! &nbsp;Give a body a rest! &nbsp;Go 'long now,
 the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got
 back my peace of mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out;
 and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead. &nbsp;As we was
 passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
 shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
 laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. &nbsp;Tom
 see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it ain't no use to send things by <i>him</i> no more, he ain't reliable."
 Then he says: &nbsp;"But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway,
 without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without <i>him</i> knowing it?stop
 up his rat-holes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
 hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. &nbsp;Then we
 heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here
 comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in
 t'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. &nbsp;He went a
 mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to
 them all. &nbsp;Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off
 of his candle and thinking. &nbsp;Then he turns off slow and dreamy
 towards the stairs, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. &nbsp;I could
 show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. &nbsp;But
 never mind?let it go. &nbsp;I reckon it wouldn't do no good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. &nbsp;He was a
 mighty nice old man. &nbsp;And always is.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
 we'd got to have it; so he took a think. &nbsp;When he had ciphered it out
 he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
 spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting
 the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my
 sleeve, and Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons <i>yet</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. &nbsp;I know better, I
 counted 'm myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count?anybody
 would.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I declare to gracious ther' <i>ain't</i> but nine!" she says. &nbsp;"Why, what
 in the world?plague <i>take</i> the things, I'll count 'm again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's <i>ten</i> now!" and she looked huffy and
 bothered both. &nbsp;But Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You numskull, didn't you see me <i>count 'm?</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know, but?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll count 'm <i>again</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. &nbsp;Well,
 she <i>was</i> in a tearing way?just a-trembling all over, she was so mad.
 &nbsp;But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to
 count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come
 out right, and three times they come out wrong. &nbsp;Then she grabbed up
 the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
 galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we
 come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us.
 &nbsp;So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
 she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
 with her shingle nail, before noon. &nbsp;We was very well satisfied with
 this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
 because he said <i>now</i> she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again
 to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she
 <i>did</i>; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next
 three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that
 wanted her to ever count them any more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her
 closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
 days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn't
 <i>care</i>, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it,
 and wouldn't count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
 the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
 counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would
 blow over by and by.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. &nbsp;We
 fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
 done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
 had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we
 got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the
 smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we
 couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. &nbsp;But of
 course we thought of the right way at last?which was to cook the
 ladder, too, in the pie. &nbsp;So then we laid in with Jim the second
 night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them
 together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a
 hung a person with. &nbsp;We let on it took nine months to make it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into
 the pie. &nbsp;Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
 enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for
 soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. &nbsp;We could a had a whole
 dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>

 </p><br>
 <p>
 But we didn't need it. &nbsp;All we needed was just enough for the pie,
 and so we throwed the rest away. &nbsp;We didn't cook none of the pies in
 the wash-pan?afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a
 noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it
 belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over
 from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them
 early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and
 things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because
 they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
 her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
 pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one.
 &nbsp;We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
 loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
 lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
 handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie
 that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want
 to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder
 wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking
 about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the
 three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
 got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
 the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched
 some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVIII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
 allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. &nbsp;That's
 the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. &nbsp;But he had
 to have it; Tom said he'd <i>got</i> to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner
 not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
 Northumberland! &nbsp;Why, Huck, s'pose it <i>is</i> considerble trouble??what
 you going to do??how you going to get around it? &nbsp;Jim's <i>got</i> to
 do his inscription and coat of arms. &nbsp;They all do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish
 yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of
 arms, because he hain't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have one before he
 goes out of this?because he's going out <i>right</i>, and there ain't going
 to be no flaws in his record."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making
his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set
 to work to think out the coat of arms. &nbsp;By and by he said he'd struck
 so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one
 which he reckoned he'd decide on. &nbsp;He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the scutcheon we'll have a bend <i>or</i> in the dexter base, a saltire
 <i>murrey</i> in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his
 foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron <i>vert</i> in a chief
 engrailed, and three invected lines on a field <i>azure</i>, with the nombril
 points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, <i>sable</i>,
 with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules
 for supporters, which is you and me; motto, <i>Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto.</i>
 &nbsp;Got it out of a book?means the more haste the less speed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it mean?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says; "we got to dig in
 like all git-out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, anyway," I says, "what's <i>some</i> of it? &nbsp;What's a fess?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fess?a fess is?<i>you</i> don't need to know what a fess is.
 &nbsp;I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person. &nbsp;What's a
 bar sinister?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know. &nbsp;But he's got to have it. &nbsp;All the nobility
 does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was just his way. &nbsp;If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to
 you, he wouldn't do it. &nbsp;You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't
 make no difference.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
 finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
 mournful inscription?said Jim got to have one, like they all done.
 &nbsp;He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off,
 so:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 1. &nbsp;Here a captive heart busted. 2. &nbsp;Here a poor prisoner,
 forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. &nbsp;Here
 a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after
 thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4. &nbsp;Here, homeless and
 friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble
 stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
 When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to
 scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he
 would let him scrabble them all on. &nbsp;Jim said it would take him a
 year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
 didn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them
 out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the
 lines. &nbsp;Then pretty soon he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls in
 a dungeon: &nbsp;we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. &nbsp;We'll
 fetch a rock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such
 a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out. &nbsp;But
 Tom said he would let me help him do it. &nbsp;Then he took a look to see
 how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. &nbsp;It was most pesky
 tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well
 of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know how to fix it. &nbsp;We got to have a rock for the coat of arms
 and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
 There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and
 carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone
 nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. &nbsp;It warn't quite midnight yet,
 so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. &nbsp;We smouched the
 grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
 job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over,
 and she come mighty near mashing us every time. &nbsp;Tom said she was
 going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. &nbsp;We got her half
 way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.
 &nbsp;We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up
 his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and
 round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and
 Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing;
 and Tom superintended. &nbsp;He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.
 &nbsp;He knowed how to do everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone
 through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. &nbsp;Then
 Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on
 them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
 lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
 quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
 his straw tick and sleep on it. &nbsp;Then we helped him fix his chain
 back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. &nbsp;But Tom
 thought of something, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You got any spiders in here, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, we'll get you some."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But bless you, honey, I doan' <i>want</i> none. &nbsp;I's afeard un um. &nbsp;I
 jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom thought a minute or two, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a good idea. &nbsp;And I reckon it's been done. &nbsp;It <i>must</i> a been
 done; it stands to reason. &nbsp;Yes, it's a prime good idea. &nbsp;Where
 could you keep it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep what, Mars Tom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, a rattlesnake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! &nbsp;Why, if dey was a rattlesnake
 to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
 my head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. &nbsp;You could
 tame it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Tame</i> it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?easy enough. &nbsp;Every animal is grateful for kindness and
 petting, and they wouldn't <i>think</i> of hurting a person that pets them.
 &nbsp;Any book will tell you that. &nbsp;You try?that's all I ask;
 just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little
 while, that he'll love you; and sleep with you; and won't stay away from
 you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head
 in your mouth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Please</i>, Mars Tom?<i>doan</i>' talk so! &nbsp;I can't <i>stan</i>' it! &nbsp;He'd
 <i>let</i> me shove his head in my mouf?fer a favor, hain't it? &nbsp;I lay
 he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I <i>ast</i> him. &nbsp;En mo' en dat, I doan'
 <i>want</i> him to sleep wid me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jim, don't act so foolish. &nbsp;A prisoner's <i>got</i> to have some kind of a
 dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more
 glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
 way you could ever think of to save your life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <i>want</i> no sich glory. &nbsp;Snake take 'n bite Jim's
 chin off, den <i>whah</i> is de glory? &nbsp;No, sah, I doan' want no sich
 doin's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blame it, can't you <i>try</i>? &nbsp;I only <i>want</i> you to try?you needn't
 keep it up if it don't work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But de trouble all <i>done</i> ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him. Mars
 Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but ef
 you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to
 <i>leave</i>, dat's <i>shore</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.
 &nbsp;We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on
 their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have
 to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I k'n stan' <i>dem</i>, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout um, I
 tell you dat. &nbsp;I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble
 to be a prisoner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it <i>always</i> is when it's done right. &nbsp;You got any rats around
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sah, I hain't seed none."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we'll get you some rats."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <i>want</i> no rats. &nbsp;Dey's de dadblamedest creturs
 to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's
 tryin' to sleep, I ever see. &nbsp;No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's
 got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um,
 skasely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Jim, you <i>got</i> to have 'em?they all do. &nbsp;So don't make no
 more fuss about it. &nbsp;Prisoners ain't ever without rats. &nbsp;There
 ain't no instance of it. &nbsp;And they train them, and pet them, and
 learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. &nbsp;But you
 got to play music to them. &nbsp;You got anything to play music on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;
 but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes they would&nbsp;<i>they</i> don't care what kind of music 'tis. &nbsp;A
 jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. &nbsp;All animals like music?in
 a prison they dote on it. &nbsp;Specially, painful music; and you can't
 get no other kind out of a jews-harp. &nbsp;It always interests them; they
 come out to see what's the matter with you. &nbsp;Yes, you're all right;
 you're fixed very well. &nbsp;You want to set on your bed nights before
 you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play
 'The Last Link is Broken'?that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat
 quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll
 see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel
 worried about you, and come. &nbsp;And they'll just fairly swarm over you,
 and have a noble good time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, <i>dey</i> will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is <i>Jim</i> havin'?
 Blest if I kin see de pint. &nbsp;But I'll do it ef I got to. &nbsp;I
 reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de
 house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and
 pretty soon he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, there's one thing I forgot. &nbsp;Could you raise a flower here, do
 you reckon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,
 en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o'
 trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you try it, anyway. &nbsp;Some other prisoners has done it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars
 Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you believe it. &nbsp;We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it
 in the corner over there, and raise it. &nbsp;And don't call it mullen,
 call it Pitchiola?that's its right name when it's in a prison.
 &nbsp;And you want to water it with your tears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't <i>want</i> spring water; you want to water it with your tears. &nbsp;It's
 the way they always do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
 spring water whiles another man's a <i>start'n</i> one wid tears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That ain't the idea. &nbsp;You <i>got</i> to do it with tears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely
 ever cry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Tom was stumped. &nbsp;But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
 have to worry along the best he could with an onion. &nbsp;He promised he
 would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot,
 in the morning. Jim said he would "jis' 's soon have tobacker in his
 coffee;" and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of
 raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering
 up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had
 to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it
 more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything
 he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he
 was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had
 in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to
 appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. &nbsp;So Jim he
 was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom
 shoved for bed.

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIX.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
 fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we
 had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it
 in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. &nbsp;But while we was gone for
 spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
 it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and
 they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
 a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
 they could to keep off the dull times for her. &nbsp;So she took and
 dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
 another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the
 likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
 &nbsp;I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
 caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's
 nest, but we didn't. &nbsp;The family was at home. &nbsp;We didn't give it
 right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed
 we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. &nbsp;Then
 we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
 again, but couldn't set down convenient. &nbsp;And so we went for the
 snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put
 them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was
 supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: &nbsp;and hungry??oh,
 no, I reckon not! &nbsp;And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we
 went back?we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow,
 and left. &nbsp;But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the
 premises somewheres. &nbsp;So we judged we could get some of them again.
 &nbsp;No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a
 considerable spell. &nbsp;You'd see them dripping from the rafters and
 places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down
 the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.
 &nbsp;Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a
 million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she
 despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them
 no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her,
 it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that
 work down and light out. &nbsp;I never see such a woman. &nbsp;And you
 could hear her whoop to Jericho. &nbsp;You couldn't get her to take a-holt
 of one of them with the tongs. &nbsp;And if she turned over and found one
 in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the
 house was afire. &nbsp;She disturbed the old man so that he said he could
 most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. &nbsp;Why, after every
 last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt
 Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting
 thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with
 a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. &nbsp;It was very
 curious. &nbsp;But Tom said all women was just so. &nbsp;He said they was
 made that way for some reason or other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
 allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
 loaded up the place again with them. &nbsp;I didn't mind the lickings,
 because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to
 lay in another lot. &nbsp;But we got them laid in, and all the other
 things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd
 all swarm out for music and go for him. &nbsp;Jim didn't like the spiders,
 and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it
 mighty warm for him. &nbsp;And he said that between the rats and the
 snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely;
 and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
 always lively, he said, because <i>they</i> never all slept at one time, but took
 turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when
 the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang
 under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if
 he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he
 crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a
 prisoner again, not for a salary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
 &nbsp;The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim
 he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was
 fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
 grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
 and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. &nbsp;We reckoned we was all
 going to die, but didn't. &nbsp;It was the most undigestible sawdust I
 ever see; and Tom said the same./

 <p>

 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was
 all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. &nbsp;The old man had
 wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get
 their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no
 such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and
 New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
 the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now
 for the nonnamous letters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's them?" &nbsp;I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Warnings to the people that something is up. &nbsp;Sometimes it's done
 one way, sometimes another. &nbsp;But there's always somebody spying
 around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. &nbsp;When Louis
 XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.
 &nbsp;It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. &nbsp;We'll
 use them both. &nbsp;And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change
 clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.
 &nbsp;We'll do that, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <i>warn</i> anybody for that something's
 up? &nbsp;Let them find it out for themselves?it's their lookout."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. &nbsp;It's the way they've
 acted from the very start?left us to do <i>everything</i>. &nbsp;They're so
 confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.
 &nbsp;So if we don't <i>give</i> them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to
 interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape
 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing?won't be nothing
 <i>to</i> it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted. &nbsp;So I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I ain't going to make no complaint. &nbsp;Any way that suits you
 suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll be her. &nbsp;You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook
 that yaller girl's frock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
 prob'bly hain't got any but that one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous
 letter and shove it under the front door."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own
 togs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You wouldn't look like a servant-girl <i>then</i>, would you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, <i>anyway</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That ain't got nothing to do with it. &nbsp;The thing for us to do is
 just to do our <i>duty</i>, and not worry about whether anybody <i>sees</i> us do it or
 not. Hain't you got no principle at all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. &nbsp;Who's
 Jim's mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm his mother. &nbsp;I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not much. &nbsp;I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his
 bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger
 woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. &nbsp;When
 a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. &nbsp;It's always
 called so when a king escapes, f'rinstance. &nbsp;And the same with a
 king's son; it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an
 unnatural one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's
 frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
 way Tom told me to. &nbsp;It said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Beware. &nbsp;Trouble is brewing. &nbsp;Keep a sharp lookout. <i>Unknown</i>
 <i>Friend</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
 crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
 the back door. &nbsp;I never see a family in such a sweat. &nbsp;They
 couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying
 for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the
 air. &nbsp;If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said "ouch!" if
 anything fell, she jumped and said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her,
 when she warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and
 be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
 time?so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch,"
 and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it
 again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. &nbsp;So
 the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing
 work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he said, now for the grand bulge! &nbsp;So the very next morning at the
 streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
 better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to
 have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. &nbsp;Tom he went down the
 lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
 and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. &nbsp;This letter
 said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. &nbsp;There is a desprate gang
 of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your
 runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you
 will stay in the house and not bother them. &nbsp;I am one of the gang,
 but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,
 and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
 along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
 nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I
 see any danger; but stead of that I will <i>baa</i> like a sheep soon as they get
 in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you
 slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. &nbsp;Don't
 do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will
 suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward
 but to know I have done the right thing. <i>Unknown Friend.</i>

 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XL.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
 over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
 look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and
 found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was
 standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
 supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word
 about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about
 it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was
 turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took
 it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and
 Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with
 the lunch, but says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's the butter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a corn-pone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you <i>left</i> it laid out, then?it ain't here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We can get along without it," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We can get along <i>with</i> it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and
 fetch it. &nbsp;And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
 along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his
 mother in disguise, and be ready to <i>baa</i> like a sheep and shove soon as you
 get there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a
 person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone
 with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very
 stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt
 Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat
 on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You been down cellar?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes'm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What you been doing down there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Noth'n."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Noth'n!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No'm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know 'm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't <i>know</i>? &nbsp;Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
 you been <i>doing</i> down there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
 have."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
 s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
 about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,
 very decided:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. &nbsp;You
 been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it
 is before I'M done with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
 My, but there was a crowd there! &nbsp;Fifteen farmers, and every one of
 them had a gun. &nbsp;I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and
 set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low
 voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they
 warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their
 hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
 seats, and fumbling with their buttons. &nbsp;I warn't easy myself, but I
 didn't take my hat off, all the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
 she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this
 thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so we
 could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before
 these rips got out of patience and come for us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I <i>couldn't</i> answer them
 straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in
 such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for
 them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and
 others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal;
 and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all
 over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place
 getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down
 my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M
 for going and getting in the cabin <i>first</i> and right <i>now</i>, and catching them
 when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling
 down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For the land's sake, what <i>is</i> the matter with the child? &nbsp;He's got
 the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the
 bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me,
 and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't
 no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when
 I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and
 all it was just like your brains would be if?Dear, dear, whyd'nt you
 <i>tell</i> me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.
 &nbsp;Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till
 morning!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
 and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. &nbsp;I couldn't hardly get
 my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
 jump for it now, and not a minute to lose?the house full of men,
 yonder, with guns!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His eyes just blazed; and he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!?is that so? &nbsp;<i>ain't</i> it bully! &nbsp;Why, Huck, if it was to
 do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! &nbsp;If we could put it
 off till?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurry! &nbsp;<i>Hurry</i>!" &nbsp;I says. &nbsp;"Where's Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. &nbsp;He's
 dressed, and everything's ready. &nbsp;Now we'll slide out and give the
 sheep-signal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
 begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I <i>told</i> you we'd be too soon; they haven't come?the door is locked.
 Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the
 dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and
 listen if you can hear 'em coming."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us
 whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. &nbsp;But we got under all
 right, and out through the hole, swift but soft?Jim first, me next,
 and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. &nbsp;Now we was in the
 lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. &nbsp;So we crept to the
 door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't
 make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
 for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
 first, and him last. &nbsp;So he set his ear to the crack and listened,
 and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
 the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not
 breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards
 the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it;
 but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he
 hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter
 and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody
 sings out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's that? &nbsp;Answer, or I'll shoot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. &nbsp;Then
 there was a rush, and a <i>Bang, Bang, Bang!</i> and the bullets fairly whizzed
 around us! We heard them sing out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here they are! &nbsp;They've broke for the river! &nbsp;After 'em, boys,
 and turn loose the dogs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So here they come, full tilt. &nbsp;We could hear them because they wore
 boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. &nbsp;We
 was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
 dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.
 &nbsp;They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the
 robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come,
 making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped
 in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but
 us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore
 right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam
 again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and
 then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in
 and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make
 no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and
 comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them
 yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so
 far away the sounds got dim and died out. &nbsp;And when we stepped on to
 the raft I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Now</i>, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a
 slave no more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. &nbsp;It 'uz planned beautiful,
 en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't <i>nobody</i> kin git up a plan dat's mo'
 mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he
 had a bullet in the calf of his leg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before.
 It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the
 wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. &nbsp;Don't stop now; don't fool
 around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps,
 and set her loose! &nbsp;Boys, we done it elegant!?'deed we did.
 &nbsp;I wish <i>we'd</i> a had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been
 no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in <i>his</i> biography;
 no, sir, we'd a whooped him over the <i>border</i>?that's what we'd a done
 with <i>him</i>?and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. &nbsp;Man
 the sweeps?man the sweeps!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But me and Jim was consulting?and thinking. &nbsp;And after we'd
 thought a minute, I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say it, Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. &nbsp;Ef it wuz <i>him</i> dat 'uz
 bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en
 save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' &nbsp;Is dat like
 Mars Tom Sawyer? &nbsp;Would he say dat? &nbsp;You <i>bet</i> he wouldn't! &nbsp;<i>well</i>,
 den, is <i>Jim</i> gywne to say it? &nbsp;No, sah?I doan' budge a step
 out'n dis place 'dout a <i>doctor</i>, not if it's forty year!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say?so
 it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor. &nbsp;He
 raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't
 budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but
 we wouldn't let him. &nbsp;Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it
 didn't do no good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you
 get to the village. &nbsp;Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
 fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full
 of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys
 and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a
 roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away
 from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the
 village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the
 way they all do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see
 the doctor coming till he was gone again.
 </p><br>
 <p>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLI.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
 him up. &nbsp;I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island
 hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and
 about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
 shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not
 say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home
 this evening and surprise the folks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is your folks?" he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Phelpses, down yonder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh," he says. &nbsp;And after a minute, he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd you say he got shot?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Singular dream," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. &nbsp;But
 when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her?said she was
 big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. &nbsp;I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What three?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, me and Sid, and?and?and <i>the guns</i>; that's what I mean."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh," he says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and
 said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. &nbsp;But they was all
 locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he
 come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home
 and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. &nbsp;But I said I
 didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I struck an idea pretty soon. &nbsp;I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
 that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n
 it takes him three or four days? &nbsp;What are we going to do??lay
 around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? &nbsp;No, sir; I know
 what <i>I'll</i> do. &nbsp;I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got
 to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie
 him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with
 him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get
 ashore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
 waked up the sun was away up over my head! &nbsp;I shot out and went for
 the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time
 or other, and warn't back yet. &nbsp;Well, thinks I, that looks powerful
 bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. &nbsp;So away I
 shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle
 Silas's stomach! He says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, <i>Tom!</i> &nbsp;Where you been all this time, you rascal?"
 </p><br>

 "I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway
 nigger?me and Sid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, where ever did you go?" he says. &nbsp;"Your aunt's been mighty
 uneasy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. &nbsp;We followed the
 men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
 heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
 crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore
 till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and
 went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled
 over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he
 can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then
 we're going home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
 suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
 office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man
 said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
 fooling around?but we would ride. &nbsp;I couldn't get him to let me
 stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must
 come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
 both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't
 amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner; and
 such another clack a body never heard. &nbsp;Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
 worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. &nbsp;She says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve
 the nigger was crazy. &nbsp;I says to Sister Damrell?didn't I,
 Sister Damrell??s'I, he's crazy, s'I?them's the very words I
 said. &nbsp;You all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.
 &nbsp;Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell <i>me</i>'t any cretur 't's
 in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a
 grindstone, s'I? &nbsp;Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n'
 here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that?natcherl
 son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage. &nbsp;He's plumb
 crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the
 middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time?the nigger's
 crazy?crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."

 <p>
 "An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss," says old
 Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness <i>could</i> he ever want of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister
 Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. &nbsp;Sh-she, look at that-air
 rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, <i>look</i> at it, s'I?what <i>could</i> he
 a-wanted of it, s'I. &nbsp;Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how in the nation'd they ever <i>git</i> that grindstone <i>in</i> there, <i>anyway</i>?
 'n' who dug that-air <i>hole</i>? 'n' who?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My very <i>words</i>, Brer Penrod! &nbsp;I was a-sayin'?pass that-air
 sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye??I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist
 this minute, how <i>did</i> they git that grindstone in there, s'I. &nbsp;Without
 <i>help</i>, mind you?'thout <i>help</i>! &nbsp;<i>that's</i> wher 'tis. &nbsp;Don't tell
 <i>me</i>, s'I; there <i>wuz</i> help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a <i>plenty</i> help, too, s'I;
 ther's ben a <i>dozen</i> a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last
 nigger on this place but <i>I'd</i> find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A <i>dozen</i> says you!?<i>forty</i> couldn't a done every thing that's been
 done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been
 made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;
 look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may <i>well</i> say it, Brer Hightower! &nbsp;It's jist as I was a-sayin' to
 Brer Phelps, his own self. &nbsp;S'e, what do <i>you</i> think of it, Sister
 Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I? &nbsp;Think o' that
 bed-leg sawed off that a way, s'e? &nbsp;<i>think</i> of it, s'I? &nbsp;I lay it
 never sawed <i>itself</i> off, s'I?somebody <i>sawed</i> it, s'I; that's my
 opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't
 is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let
 him <i>do</i> it, s'I, that's all. &nbsp;I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every
 night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. &nbsp;Look at
 that shirt?every last inch of it kivered over with secret African
 writ'n done with blood! &nbsp;Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along,
 all the time, amost. &nbsp;Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to
 me; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "People to <i>help</i> him, Brother Marples! &nbsp;Well, I reckon you'd <i>think</i> so
 if you'd a been in this house for a while back. &nbsp;Why, they've stole
 everything they could lay their hands on?and we a-watching all the
 time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for
 that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how
 many times they <i>didn't</i> steal that; and flour, and candles, and
 candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand
 things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas
 and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day <i>and</i> night, as I was a-telling
 you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of
 them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in
 under our noses and fools us, and not only fools <i>us</i> but the Injun
 Territory robbers too, and actuly gets <i>away</i> with that nigger safe and
 sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very
 heels at that very time! &nbsp;I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever
 <i>heard</i> of. Why, <i>sperits</i> couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I
 reckon they must a <i>been</i> sperits?because, <i>you</i> know our dogs, and
 ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the <i>track</i> of 'm
 once! &nbsp;You explain <i>that</i> to me if you can!?<i>any</i> of you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it does beat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laws alive, I never?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So help me, I wouldn't a be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>House</i>-thieves as well as?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Fraid to <i>live</i>!?why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed,
 or get up, or lay down, or <i>set</i> down, Sister Ridgeway. &nbsp;Why, they'd
 steal the very?why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a
 fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. &nbsp;I hope to
 gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family! &nbsp;I was
 just to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more. &nbsp;It
 looks foolish enough <i>now</i>, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my
 two poor boys asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare
 to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!
 &nbsp;I <i>did</i>. &nbsp;And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get
 scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all
 the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o'
 wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and
 was away up there, and the door ain't locked, and you?" She stopped,
 looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and
 when her eye lit on me?I got up and took a walk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room
 this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. &nbsp;So
 I done it. &nbsp;But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. &nbsp;And
 when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
 told her the noise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the door was
 locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
 and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try <i>that</i> no
 more. &nbsp;And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
 before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right
 enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
 was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as
 no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being
 grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting
 over what was past and done. &nbsp;So then she kissed me, and patted me on
 the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps
 up, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! &nbsp;What <i>has</i>
 become of that boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I see my chance; so I skips up and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No you won't," she says. &nbsp;"You'll stay right wher' you are; <i>one's</i>
 enough to be lost at a time. &nbsp;If he ain't here to supper, your uncle
 'll go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track.
 Aunt Sally was a good <i>deal</i> uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no
 occasion to be?boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one
 turn up in the morning all sound and right. &nbsp;So she had to be
 satisfied. &nbsp;But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and
 keep a light burning so he could see it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle,
 and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't
 look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a
 long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't seem to want
 to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I
 reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be
 laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to
 help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her
 that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she
 would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and
 keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much
 trouble. &nbsp;And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so
 steady and gentle, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the
 rod; but you'll be good, <i>won't</i> you? &nbsp;And you won't go? &nbsp;For <i>my</i>
 sake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Laws knows I <i>wanted</i> to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
 intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
 And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front,
 and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes
 towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something
 for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to
 grieve her any more. &nbsp;And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid
 down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray
 head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.
 </p><br>

 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLII.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track
 of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
 nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
 eating anything. And by and by the old man says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did I give you the letter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What letter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you didn't give me no letter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I must a forgot it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid
 it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. &nbsp;She says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, it's from St. Petersburg?it's from Sis."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. &nbsp;But
 before she could break it open she dropped it and run?for she see
 something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
 doctor; and Jim, in <i>her</i> calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and
 a lot of people. &nbsp;I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
 handy, and rushed. &nbsp;She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
 which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and
 says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's alive, thank God! &nbsp;And that's enough!" and she snatched a kiss
 of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
 right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
 could go, every jump of the way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old
 doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. &nbsp;The men
 was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all
 the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away
 like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole
 family scared most to death for days and nights. &nbsp;But the others
 said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his
 owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. &nbsp;So that cooled
 them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for
 to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that
 ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction
 out of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
 head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
 know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on
 him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big
 staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both
 legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
 this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come
 in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of
 farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and
 a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was
 through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye
 cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a
 bad nigger. &nbsp;When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut
 the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to
 leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse,
 and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come
 a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no
 end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all
 with him; so I says, I got to have <i>help</i> somehow; and the minute I says it
 out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done
 it, too, and done it very well. &nbsp;Of course I judged he must be a
 runaway nigger, and there I <i>was</i>! and there I had to stick right straight
 along all the rest of the day and all night. &nbsp;It was a fix, I tell
 you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of
 liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger
 might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close
 enough for me to hail. &nbsp;So there I had to stick plumb until daylight
 this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or
 faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all
 tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.
 &nbsp;I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like
 that is worth a thousand dollars?and kind treatment, too. &nbsp;I
 had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a
 done at home?better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
 <i>was</i>, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn
 this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would
 have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his
 knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on
 him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and
 we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep,
 too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very
 nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word
 from the start. &nbsp;He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I
 think about him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somebody says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to
 that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
 according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
 heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. &nbsp;Then they
 all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
 notice took of it, and reward. &nbsp;So every one of them promised, right
 out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they come out and locked him up. &nbsp;I hoped they was going to say
 he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
 heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
 didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I
 judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as
 I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me?explanations,
 I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling
 how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the
 runaway nigger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I had plenty time. &nbsp;Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
 and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally
 was gone to get a nap. &nbsp;So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found
 him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would
 wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not
 fire-faced the way he was when he come. &nbsp;So I set down and laid for
 him to wake. &nbsp;In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and
 there I was, up a stump again! &nbsp;She motioned me to be still, and set
 down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,
 because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that
 for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten
 to one he'd wake up in his right mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
 eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello!?why, I'm at <i>home</i>! &nbsp;How's that? &nbsp;Where's the raft?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's all right," I says.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And <i>Jim</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. &nbsp;But he never
 noticed, but says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! &nbsp;Splendid! &nbsp;<i>Now</i> we're all right and safe! Did you tell
 Aunty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: &nbsp;"About what,
 Sid?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, about the way the whole thing was done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What whole thing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, <i>the</i> whole thing. &nbsp;There ain't but one; how we set the runaway
 nigger free?me and Tom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good land! &nbsp;Set the run?What <i>is</i> the child talking about!
 &nbsp;Dear, dear, out of his head again!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>No</i>, I ain't out of my <i>head</i>; I know all what I'm talking about. &nbsp;We
 <i>did</i> set him free?me and Tom. &nbsp;We laid out to do it, and we <i>done</i>
 it. &nbsp;And we done it elegant, too." &nbsp;He'd got a start, and she
 never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip
 along, and I see it warn't no use for <i>me</i> to put in. &nbsp;"Why, Aunty, it
 cost us a power of work?weeks of it?hours and hours, every
 night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the
 sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and
 case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just
 no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make the saws,
 and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think
 <i>half</i> the fun it was. &nbsp;And we had to make up the pictures of coffins
 and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down
 the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope
 ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to
 work with in your apron pocket?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mercy sakes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company
 for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat
 that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
 we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
 drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
 them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went
 for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was
 all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and
 <i>wasn't</i> it bully, Aunty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! &nbsp;So it was
 <i>you</i>, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and
 turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.
 &nbsp;I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o' you
 this very minute. &nbsp;To think, here I've been, night after night, a?<i>you</i>
 just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out
 o' both o' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Tom, he <i>was</i> so proud and joyful, he just <i>couldn't</i> hold in, and his
 tongue just <i>went</i> it?she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along,
 and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Well</i>, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it <i>now</i>, for mind I tell
 you if I catch you meddling with him again?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Meddling with <i>who</i>?" &nbsp;Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
 surprised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With <i>who</i>? &nbsp;Why, the runaway nigger, of course. &nbsp;Who'd you
 reckon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom looks at me very grave, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? &nbsp;Hasn't he got away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Him</i>?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger? &nbsp;'Deed he hasn't. &nbsp;They've
 got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and
 water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and
 shutting like gills, and sings out to me:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They hain't no <i>right</i> to shut him up! &nbsp;SHOVE!?and don't you
 lose a minute. &nbsp;Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as
 any cretur that walks this earth!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What <i>does</i> the child mean?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I mean every word I <i>say</i>, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, <i>I'll</i> go.
 I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. &nbsp;Old Miss Watson
 died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
 down the river, and <i>said</i> so; and she set him free in her will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what on earth did <i>you</i> want to set him free for, seeing he was
 already free?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that <i>is</i> a question, I must say; and just like women! &nbsp;Why, I
 wanted the <i>adventure</i> of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to?goodness
 alive, <i>Aunt Polly!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet
 and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried
 over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was
 getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. &nbsp;And I peeped out, and in
 a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there
 looking across at Tom over her spectacles?kind of grinding him into
 the earth, you know. &nbsp;And then she says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, you <i>better</i> turn y'r head away?I would if I was you, Tom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "<i>Is</i> he changed so? &nbsp;Why, that ain't
 <i>Tom</i>, it's Sid; Tom's?Tom's?why, where is Tom? &nbsp;He was
 here a minute ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean where's Huck <i>Finn</i>?that's what you mean! &nbsp;I reckon I
 hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when
 I <i>see</i> him. &nbsp;That <i>would</i> be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
 bed, Huck Finn."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So I done it. &nbsp;But not feeling brash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see?except
 one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to
 him. &nbsp;It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know
 nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon
 that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in
 the world couldn't a understood it. &nbsp;So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told
 all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such
 a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer?she
 chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it
 now, and 'tain't no need to change"?that when Aunt Sally took me for
 Tom Sawyer I had to stand it?there warn't no other way, and I knowed
 he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and
 he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. &nbsp;And so
 it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he
 could for me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
 Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
 all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't ever
 understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he <i>could</i> help a
 body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
 <i>Sid</i> had come all right and safe, she says to herself:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at that, now! &nbsp;I might have expected it, letting him go off
 that way without anybody to watch him. &nbsp;So now I got to go and trapse
 all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
 creetur's up to <i>this</i> time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer
 out of you about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I wonder! &nbsp;Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could
 mean by Sid being here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I never got 'em, Sis."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You, Tom!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?<i>what</i>?" he says, kind of pettish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you what <i>me</i>, you impudent thing?hand out them letters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What letters?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Them</i> letters. &nbsp;I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're in the trunk. &nbsp;There, now. &nbsp;And they're just the same
 as they was when I got them out of the office. &nbsp;I hain't looked into
 them, I hain't touched them. &nbsp;But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I
 thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you <i>do</i> need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. &nbsp;And I
 wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but <i>it's</i> all right, I've got
 that one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it
 was just as safe to not to. &nbsp;So I never said nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER THE LAST
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
 of the evasion??what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked
 all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free
 before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we
 got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft,
 and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him
 about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
 and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the
 niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
 procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.
 &nbsp;But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
 Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
 they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
 all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. &nbsp;And we had
 him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
 dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and
 Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
 <br>
 </div>
 <p>
 <br> <br> <br>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you??what I tell you up dah on Jackson
 islan'? &nbsp;I <i>tole</i> you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en
 I <i>tole</i> you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich <i>agin</i>; en it's come
 true; en heah she is! &nbsp;<i>dah</i>, now! doan' talk to <i>me</i>?signs is
 <i>signs</i>, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be
 rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three
 slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
 howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple
 of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no
 money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home,
 because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from
 Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet?six thousand dollars
 and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. &nbsp;Hadn't when I
 come away, anyhow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim says, kind of solemn:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Jim?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nemmine why, Huck?but he ain't comin' back no mo."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I kept at him; so at last he says:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a
 man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
 come in? &nbsp;Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase
 dat wuz him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
 for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't
 nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a
 knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and
 ain't a-going to no more. &nbsp;But I reckon I got to light out for the
 Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me
 and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. &nbsp;I been there before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE END. YOURS TRULY, <i>HUCK FINN</i>.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
