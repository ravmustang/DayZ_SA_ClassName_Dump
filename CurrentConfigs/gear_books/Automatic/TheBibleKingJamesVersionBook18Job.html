<h1>Book 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job</h1>

<p>18:001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eschewed evil.</p><br>

<p>18:001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p><br>

<p>18:001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</p><br>

<p>18:001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink with them.</p><br>

<p>18:001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continually.</p><br>

<p>18:001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</p><br>

<p>18:001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p><br>

<p>18:001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p><br>

<p>18:001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nought?</p><br>

<p>18:001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land.</p><br>

<p>18:001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will curse thee to thy face.</p><br>

<p>18:001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</p><br>

<p>18:001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</p><br>

<p>18:001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</p><br>

<p>18:001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am escaped alone to tell thee.</p><br>

<p>18:001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escaped alone to tell thee.</p><br>

<p>18:001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p><br>

<p>18:001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their eldest brother's house:</p><br>

<p>18:001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell thee.</p><br>

<p>18:001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p><br>

<p>18:001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</p><br>

<p>18:001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</p><br>

<p>18:002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present himself before the LORD.</p><br>

<p>18:002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p><br>

<p>18:002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against him, to destroy him without cause.</p><br>

<p>18:002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a man hath will he give for his life.</p><br>

<p>18:002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p><br>

<p>18:002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save his life.</p><br>

<p>18:002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</p><br>

<p>18:002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sat down among the ashes.</p><br>

<p>18:002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrity? curse God, and die.</p><br>

<p>18:002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin with his lips.</p><br>

<p>18:002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p><br>

<p>18:002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p><br>

<p>18:002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grief was very great.</p><br>

<p>18:003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p><br>

<p>18:003:002 And Job spake, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p><br>

<p>18:003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither let the light shine upon it.</p><br>

<p>18:003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p><br>

<p>18:003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of the months.</p><br>

<p>18:003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therein.</p><br>

<p>18:003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up their mourning.</p><br>

<p>18:003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day:</p><br>

<p>18:003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrow from mine eyes.</p><br>

<p>18:003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I came out of the belly?</p><br>

<p>18:003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suck?</p><br>

<p>18:003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slept: then had I been at rest,</p><br>

<p>18:003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places for themselves;</p><br>

<p>18:003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver:</p><br>

<p>18:003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which never saw light.</p><br>

<p>18:003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at rest.</p><br>

<p>18:003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oppressor.</p><br>

<p>18:003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his master.</p><br>

<p>18:003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the bitter in soul;</p><br>

<p>18:003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than for hid treasures;</p><br>

<p>18:003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grave?</p><br>

<p>18:003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath hedged in?</p><br>

<p>18:003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out like the waters.</p><br>

<p>18:003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p><br>

<p>18:003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet trouble came.</p><br>

<p>18:004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can withhold himself from speaking?</p><br>

<p>18:004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the weak hands.</p><br>

<p>18:004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthened the feeble knees.</p><br>

<p>18:004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and thou art troubled.</p><br>

<p>18:004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uprightness of thy ways?</p><br>

<p>18:004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where were the righteous cut off?</p><br>

<p>18:004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness, reap the same.</p><br>

<p>18:004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nostrils are they consumed.</p><br>

<p>18:004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p><br>

<p>18:004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whelps are scattered abroad.</p><br>

<p>18:004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falleth on men,</p><br>

<p>18:004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shake.</p><br>

<p>18:004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stood up:</p><br>

<p>18:004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice, saying,</p><br>

<p>18:004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pure than his maker?</p><br>

<p>18:004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged with folly:</p><br>

<p>18:004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</p><br>

<p>18:004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever without any regarding it.</p><br>

<p>18:004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even without wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the saints wilt thou turn?</p><br>

<p>18:005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one.</p><br>

<p>18:005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;habitation.</p><br>

<p>18:005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</p><br>

<p>18:005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</p><br>

<p>18:005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble spring out of the ground;</p><br>

<p>18:005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</p><br>

<p>18:005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p><br>

<p>18:005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without number:</p><br>

<p>18:005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fields:</p><br>

<p>18:005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be exalted to safety.</p><br>

<p>18:005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p><br>

<p>18:005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the froward is carried headlong.</p><br>

<p>18:005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noonday as in the night.</p><br>

<p>18:005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the hand of the mighty.</p><br>

<p>18:005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p><br>

<p>18:005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make whole.</p><br>

<p>18:005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall no evil touch thee.</p><br>

<p>18:005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power of the sword.</p><br>

<p>18:005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p><br>

<p>18:005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p><br>

<p>18:005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</p><br>

<p>18:005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring as the grass of the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corn cometh in in his season.</p><br>

<p>18:005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it for thy good.</p><br>

<p>18:006:001 But Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the balances together!</p><br>

<p>18:006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore my words are swallowed up.</p><br>

<p>18:006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves in array against me.</p><br>

<p>18:006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over his fodder?</p><br>

<p>18:006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any taste in the white of an egg?</p><br>

<p>18:006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.</p><br>

<p>18:006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing that I long for!</p><br>

<p>18:006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loose his hand, and cut me off!</p><br>

<p>18:006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Holy One.</p><br>

<p>18:006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I should prolong my life?</p><br>

<p>18:006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brass?</p><br>

<p>18:006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p><br>

<p>18:006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p><br>

<p>18:006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stream of brooks they pass away;</p><br>

<p>18:006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is hid:</p><br>

<p>18:006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumed out of their place.</p><br>

<p>18:006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perish.</p><br>

<p>18:006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p><br>

<p>18:006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thither, and were ashamed.</p><br>

<p>18:006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid.</p><br>

<p>18:006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substance?</p><br>

<p>18:006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of the mighty?</p><br>

<p>18:006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand wherein I have erred.</p><br>

<p>18:006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprove?</p><br>

<p>18:006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is desperate, which are as wind?</p><br>

<p>18:006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend.</p><br>

<p>18:006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you if I lie.</p><br>

<p>18:006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my righteousness is in it.</p><br>

<p>18:006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perverse things?</p><br>

<p>18:007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days also like the days of an hireling?</p><br>

<p>18:007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looketh for the reward of his work:</p><br>

<p>18:007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are appointed to me.</p><br>

<p>18:007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day.</p><br>

<p>18:007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken, and become loathsome.</p><br>

<p>18:007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without hope.</p><br>

<p>18:007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good.</p><br>

<p>18:007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p><br>

<p>18:007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down to the grave shall come up no more.</p><br>

<p>18:007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know him any more.</p><br>

<p>18:007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul.</p><br>

<p>18:007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p><br>

<p>18:007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complaints;</p><br>

<p>18:007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visions:</p><br>

<p>18:007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life.</p><br>

<p>18:007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are vanity.</p><br>

<p>18:007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouldest set thine heart upon him?</p><br>

<p>18:007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every moment?</p><br>

<p>18:007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swallow down my spittle?</p><br>

<p>18:007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a burden to myself?</p><br>

<p>18:007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p><br>

<p>18:008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p><br>

<p>18:008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justice?</p><br>

<p>18:008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away for their transgression;</p><br>

<p>18:008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplication to the Almighty;</p><br>

<p>18:008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p><br>

<p>18:008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatly increase.</p><br>

<p>18:008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself to the search of their fathers:</p><br>

<p>18:008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days upon earth are a shadow:)</p><br>

<p>18:008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their heart?</p><br>

<p>18:008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water?</p><br>

<p>18:008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withereth before any other herb.</p><br>

<p>18:008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope shall perish:</p><br>

<p>18:008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spider's web.</p><br>

<p>18:008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</p><br>

<p>18:008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his garden.</p><br>

<p>18:008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones.</p><br>

<p>18:008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, I have not seen thee.</p><br>

<p>18:008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others grow.</p><br>

<p>18:008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help the evil doers:</p><br>

<p>18:008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoicing.</p><br>

<p>18:008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</p><br>

<p>18:009:001 Then Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God?</p><br>

<p>18:009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand.</p><br>

<p>18:009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself against him, and hath prospered?</p><br>

<p>18:009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overturneth them in his anger.</p><br>

<p>18:009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof tremble.</p><br>

<p>18:009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stars.</p><br>

<p>18:009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waves of the sea.</p><br>

<p>18:009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the south.</p><br>

<p>18:009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without number.</p><br>

<p>18:009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I perceive him not.</p><br>

<p>18:009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, What doest thou?</p><br>

<p>18:009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under him.</p><br>

<p>18:009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason with him?</p><br>

<p>18:009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would make supplication to my judge.</p><br>

<p>18:009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</p><br>

<p>18:009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without cause.</p><br>

<p>18:009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bitterness.</p><br>

<p>18:009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who shall set me a time to plead?</p><br>

<p>18:009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</p><br>

<p>18:009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despise my life.</p><br>

<p>18:009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect and the wicked.</p><br>

<p>18:009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the innocent.</p><br>

<p>18:009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</p><br>

<p>18:009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no good.</p><br>

<p>18:009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hasteth to the prey.</p><br>

<p>18:009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaviness, and comfort myself:</p><br>

<p>18:009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me innocent.</p><br>

<p>18:009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</p><br>

<p>18:009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean;</p><br>

<p>18:009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall abhor me.</p><br>

<p>18:009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should come together in judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand upon us both.</p><br>

<p>18:009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrify me:</p><br>

<p>18:009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p><br>

<p>18:010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p><br>

<p>18:010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contendest with me.</p><br>

<p>18:010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsel of the wicked?</p><br>

<p>18:010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</p><br>

<p>18:010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</p><br>

<p>18:010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my sin?</p><br>

<p>18:010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver out of thine hand.</p><br>

<p>18:010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p><br>

<p>18:010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p><br>

<p>18:010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheese?</p><br>

<p>18:010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bones and sinews.</p><br>

<p>18:010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved my spirit.</p><br>

<p>18:010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is with thee.</p><br>

<p>18:010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from mine iniquity.</p><br>

<p>18:010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou mine affliction;</p><br>

<p>18:010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p><br>

<p>18:010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</p><br>

<p>18:010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</p><br>

<p>18:010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been carried from the womb to the grave.</p><br>

<p>18:010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take comfort a little,</p><br>

<p>18:010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness and the shadow of death;</p><br>

<p>18:010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p><br>

<p>18:011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man full of talk be justified?</p><br>

<p>18:011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p><br>

<p>18:011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine eyes.</p><br>

<p>18:011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p><br>

<p>18:011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p><br>

<p>18:011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty unto perfection?</p><br>

<p>18:011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what canst thou know?</p><br>

<p>18:011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea.</p><br>

<p>18:011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinder him?</p><br>

<p>18:011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then consider it?</p><br>

<p>18:011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ass's colt.</p><br>

<p>18:011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward him;</p><br>

<p>18:011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p><br>

<p>18:011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p><br>

<p>18:011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters that pass away:</p><br>

<p>18:011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p><br>

<p>18:011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p><br>

<p>18:011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p><br>

<p>18:011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</p><br>

<p>18:012:001 And Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p><br>

<p>18:012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</p><br>

<p>18:012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</p><br>

<p>18:012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the thought of him that is at ease.</p><br>

<p>18:012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p><br>

<p>18:012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p><br>

<p>18:012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p><br>

<p>18:012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought this?</p><br>

<p>18:012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breath of all mankind.</p><br>

<p>18:012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</p><br>

<p>18:012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p><br>

<p>18:012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are his.</p><br>

<p>18:012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fools.</p><br>

<p>18:012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girdle.</p><br>

<p>18:012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p><br>

<p>18:012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of the aged.</p><br>

<p>18:012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the mighty.</p><br>

<p>18:012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to light the shadow of death.</p><br>

<p>18:012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nations, and straiteneth them again.</p><br>

<p>18:012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no way.</p><br>

<p>18:012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stagger like a drunken man.</p><br>

<p>18:013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understood it.</p><br>

<p>18:013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p><br>

<p>18:013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with God.</p><br>

<p>18:013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</p><br>

<p>18:013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lips.</p><br>

<p>18:013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</p><br>

<p>18:013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</p><br>

<p>18:013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</p><br>

<p>18:013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</p><br>

<p>18:013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon you?</p><br>

<p>18:013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of clay.</p><br>

<p>18:013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on me what will.</p><br>

<p>18:013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine hand?</p><br>

<p>18:013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain mine own ways before him.</p><br>

<p>18:013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him.</p><br>

<p>18:013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</p><br>

<p>18:013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justified.</p><br>

<p>18:013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</p><br>

<p>18:013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thee.</p><br>

<p>18:013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid.</p><br>

<p>18:013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou me.</p><br>

<p>18:013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgression and my sin.</p><br>

<p>18:013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy?</p><br>

<p>18:013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dry stubble?</p><br>

<p>18:013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possess the iniquities of my youth.</p><br>

<p>18:013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet.</p><br>

<p>18:013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth eaten.</p><br>

<p>18:014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble.</p><br>

<p>18:014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a shadow, and continueth not.</p><br>

<p>18:014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me into judgment with thee?</p><br>

<p>18:014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p><br>

<p>18:014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p><br>

<p>18:014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an hireling, his day.</p><br>

<p>18:014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cease.</p><br>

<p>18:014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof die in the ground;</p><br>

<p>18:014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boughs like a plant.</p><br>

<p>18:014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and where is he?</p><br>

<p>18:014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drieth up:</p><br>

<p>18:014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p><br>

<p>18:014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p><br>

<p>18:014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p><br>

<p>18:014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire to the work of thine hands.</p><br>

<p>18:014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin?</p><br>

<p>18:014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine iniquity.</p><br>

<p>18:014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock is removed out of his place.</p><br>

<p>18:014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope of man.</p><br>

<p>18:014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p><br>

<p>18:014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</p><br>

<p>18:014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him shall mourn.</p><br>

<p>18:015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the east wind?</p><br>

<p>18:015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherewith he can do no good?</p><br>

<p>18:015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p><br>

<p>18:015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tongue of the crafty.</p><br>

<p>18:015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lips testify against thee.</p><br>

<p>18:015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hills?</p><br>

<p>18:015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom to thyself?</p><br>

<p>18:015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is not in us?</p><br>

<p>18:015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than thy father.</p><br>

<p>18:015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret thing with thee?</p><br>

<p>18:015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wink at,</p><br>

<p>18:015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words go out of thy mouth?</p><br>

<p>18:015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a woman, that he should be righteous?</p><br>

<p>18:015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not clean in his sight.</p><br>

<p>18:015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniquity like water?</p><br>

<p>18:015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare;</p><br>

<p>18:015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it:</p><br>

<p>18:015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among them.</p><br>

<p>18:015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p><br>

<p>18:015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come upon him.</p><br>

<p>18:015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is waited for of the sword.</p><br>

<p>18:015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p><br>

<p>18:015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p><br>

<p>18:015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself against the Almighty.</p><br>

<p>18:015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his bucklers:</p><br>

<p>18:015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collops of fat on his flanks.</p><br>

<p>18:015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p><br>

<p>18:015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.</p><br>

<p>18:015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p><br>

<p>18:015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be his recompence.</p><br>

<p>18:015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not be green.</p><br>

<p>18:015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast off his flower as the olive.</p><br>

<p>18:015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p><br>

<p>18:015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belly prepareth deceit.</p><br>

<p>18:016:001 Then Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all.</p><br>

<p>18:016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou answerest?</p><br>

<p>18:016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at you.</p><br>

<p>18:016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lips should asswage your grief.</p><br>

<p>18:016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbear, what am I eased?</p><br>

<p>18:016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company.</p><br>

<p>18:016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my face.</p><br>

<p>18:016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p><br>

<p>18:016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together against me.</p><br>

<p>18:016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hands of the wicked.</p><br>

<p>18:016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his mark.</p><br>

<p>18:016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground.</p><br>

<p>18:016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a giant.</p><br>

<p>18:016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dust.</p><br>

<p>18:016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of death;</p><br>

<p>18:016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</p><br>

<p>18:016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place.</p><br>

<p>18:016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high.</p><br>

<p>18:016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p><br>

<p>18:016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his neighbour!</p><br>

<p>18:016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not return.</p><br>

<p>18:017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready for me.</p><br>

<p>18:017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their provocation?</p><br>

<p>18:017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will strike hands with me?</p><br>

<p>18:017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt thou not exalt them.</p><br>

<p>18:017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children shall fail.</p><br>

<p>18:017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was as a tabret.</p><br>

<p>18:017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are as a shadow.</p><br>

<p>18:017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p><br>

<p>18:017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p><br>

<p>18:017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find one wise man among you.</p><br>

<p>18:017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts of my heart.</p><br>

<p>18:017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness.</p><br>

<p>18:017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness.</p><br>

<p>18:017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art my mother, and my sister.</p><br>

<p>18:017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</p><br>

<p>18:017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together is in the dust.</p><br>

<p>18:018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwards we will speak.</p><br>

<p>18:018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sight?</p><br>

<p>18:018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</p><br>

<p>18:018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his fire shall not shine.</p><br>

<p>18:018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be put out with him.</p><br>

<p>18:018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsel shall cast him down.</p><br>

<p>18:018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a snare.</p><br>

<p>18:018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevail against him.</p><br>

<p>18:018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way.</p><br>

<p>18:018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to his feet.</p><br>

<p>18:018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready at his side.</p><br>

<p>18:018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of death shall devour his strength.</p><br>

<p>18:018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p><br>

<p>18:018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p><br>

<p>18:018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch be cut off.</p><br>

<p>18:018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no name in the street.</p><br>

<p>18:018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world.</p><br>

<p>18:018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remaining in his dwellings.</p><br>

<p>18:018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that went before were affrighted.</p><br>

<p>18:018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place of him that knoweth not God.</p><br>

<p>18:019:001 Then Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words?</p><br>

<p>18:019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye make yourselves strange to me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself.</p><br>

<p>18:019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me my reproach:</p><br>

<p>18:019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his net.</p><br>

<p>18:019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness in my paths.</p><br>

<p>18:019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head.</p><br>

<p>18:019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope hath he removed like a tree.</p><br>

<p>18:019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him as one of his enemies.</p><br>

<p>18:019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p><br>

<p>18:019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verily estranged from me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgotten me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p><br>

<p>18:019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children's sake of mine own body.</p><br>

<p>18:019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned against me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the skin of my teeth.</p><br>

<p>18:019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of God hath touched me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh?</p><br>

<p>18:019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a book!</p><br>

<p>18:019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever!</p><br>

<p>18:019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the latter day upon the earth:</p><br>

<p>18:019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh shall I see God:</p><br>

<p>18:019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</p><br>

<p>18:019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the matter is found in me?</p><br>

<p>18:019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make haste.</p><br>

<p>18:020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding causeth me to answer.</p><br>

<p>18:020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</p><br>

<p>18:020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypocrite but for a moment?</p><br>

<p>18:020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reach unto the clouds;</p><br>

<p>18:020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have seen him shall say, Where is he?</p><br>

<p>18:020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p><br>

<p>18:020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall his place any more behold him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall restore their goods.</p><br>

<p>18:020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down with him in the dust.</p><br>

<p>18:020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under his tongue;</p><br>

<p>18:020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within his mouth:</p><br>

<p>18:020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p><br>

<p>18:020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slay him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and butter.</p><br>

<p>18:020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swallow it down: according to his substance shall the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</p><br>

<p>18:020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p><br>

<p>18:020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save of that which he desired.</p><br>

<p>18:020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look for his goods.</p><br>

<p>18:020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eating.</p><br>

<p>18:020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strike him through.</p><br>

<p>18:020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his tabernacle.</p><br>

<p>18:020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up against him.</p><br>

<p>18:020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow away in the day of his wrath.</p><br>

<p>18:020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed unto him by God.</p><br>

<p>18:021:001 But Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p><br>

<p>18:021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on.</p><br>

<p>18:021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not my spirit be troubled?</p><br>

<p>18:021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my flesh.</p><br>

<p>18:021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power?</p><br>

<p>18:021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring before their eyes.</p><br>

<p>18:021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon them.</p><br>

<p>18:021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casteth not her calf.</p><br>

<p>18:021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children dance.</p><br>

<p>18:021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the organ.</p><br>

<p>18:021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grave.</p><br>

<p>18:021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the knowledge of thy ways.</p><br>

<p>18:021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p><br>

<p>18:021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is far from me.</p><br>

<p>18:021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his anger.</p><br>

<p>18:021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;storm carrieth away.</p><br>

<p>18:021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he shall know it.</p><br>

<p>18:021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrath of the Almighty.</p><br>

<p>18:021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p><br>

<p>18:021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are high.</p><br>

<p>18:021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quiet.</p><br>

<p>18:021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marrow.</p><br>

<p>18:021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eateth with pleasure.</p><br>

<p>18:021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cover them.</p><br>

<p>18:021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrongfully imagine against me.</p><br>

<p>18:021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dwelling places of the wicked?</p><br>

<p>18:021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their tokens,</p><br>

<p>18:021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p><br>

<p>18:021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what he hath done?</p><br>

<p>18:021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomb.</p><br>

<p>18:021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</p><br>

<p>18:021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remaineth falsehood?</p><br>

<p>18:022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profitable unto himself?</p><br>

<p>18:022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p><br>

<p>18:022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into judgment?</p><br>

<p>18:022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</p><br>

<p>18:022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stripped the naked of their clothing.</p><br>

<p>18:022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withholden bread from the hungry.</p><br>

<p>18:022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honourable man dwelt in it.</p><br>

<p>18:022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatherless have been broken.</p><br>

<p>18:022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubleth thee;</p><br>

<p>18:022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cover thee.</p><br>

<p>18:022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stars, how high they are!</p><br>

<p>18:022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark cloud?</p><br>

<p>18:022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p><br>

<p>18:022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p><br>

<p>18:022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overflown with a flood:</p><br>

<p>18:022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do for them?</p><br>

<p>18:022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the wicked is far from me.</p><br>

<p>18:022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them to scorn.</p><br>

<p>18:022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fire consumeth.</p><br>

<p>18:022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come unto thee.</p><br>

<p>18:022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words in thine heart.</p><br>

<p>18:022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</p><br>

<p>18:022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stones of the brooks.</p><br>

<p>18:022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plenty of silver.</p><br>

<p>18:022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p><br>

<p>18:022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p><br>

<p>18:022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</p><br>

<p>18:022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up; and he shall save the humble person.</p><br>

<p>18:022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p><br>

<p>18:023:001 Then Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my groaning.</p><br>

<p>18:023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to his seat!</p><br>

<p>18:023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguments.</p><br>

<p>18:023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand what he would say unto me.</p><br>

<p>18:023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would put strength in me.</p><br>

<p>18:023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered for ever from my judge.</p><br>

<p>18:023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot perceive him:</p><br>

<p>18:023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</p><br>

<p>18:023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come forth as gold.</p><br>

<p>18:023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declined.</p><br>

<p>18:023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food.</p><br>

<p>18:023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desireth, even that he doeth.</p><br>

<p>18:023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such things are with him.</p><br>

<p>18:023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid of him.</p><br>

<p>18:023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p><br>

<p>18:023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covered the darkness from my face.</p><br>

<p>18:024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that know him not see his days?</p><br>

<p>18:024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and feed thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widow's ox for a pledge.</p><br>

<p>18:024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves together.</p><br>

<p>18:024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for them and for their children.</p><br>

<p>18:024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vintage of the wicked.</p><br>

<p>18:024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no covering in the cold.</p><br>

<p>18:024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rock for want of a shelter.</p><br>

<p>18:024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the poor.</p><br>

<p>18:024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away the sheaf from the hungry;</p><br>

<p>18:024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p><br>

<p>18:024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</p><br>

<p>18:024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the night is as a thief.</p><br>

<p>18:024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p><br>

<p>18:024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p><br>

<p>18:024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p><br>

<p>18:024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p><br>

<p>18:024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those which have sinned.</p><br>

<p>18:024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a tree.</p><br>

<p>18:024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good to the widow.</p><br>

<p>18:024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man is sure of life.</p><br>

<p>18:024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p><br>

<p>18:024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the tops of the ears of corn.</p><br>

<p>18:024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speech nothing worth?</p><br>

<p>18:025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places.</p><br>

<p>18:025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light arise?</p><br>

<p>18:025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is born of a woman?</p><br>

<p>18:025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not pure in his sight.</p><br>

<p>18:025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a worm?</p><br>

<p>18:026:001 But Job answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou the arm that hath no strength?</p><br>

<p>18:026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</p><br>

<p>18:026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee?</p><br>

<p>18:026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabitants thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p><br>

<p>18:026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth upon nothing.</p><br>

<p>18:026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not rent under them.</p><br>

<p>18:026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud upon it.</p><br>

<p>18:026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night come to an end.</p><br>

<p>18:026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproof.</p><br>

<p>18:026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he smiteth through the proud.</p><br>

<p>18:026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formed the crooked serpent.</p><br>

<p>18:026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p><br>

<p>18:027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;</p><br>

<p>18:027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my nostrils;</p><br>

<p>18:027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceit.</p><br>

<p>18:027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove mine integrity from me.</p><br>

<p>18:027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p><br>

<p>18:027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me as the unrighteous.</p><br>

<p>18:027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when God taketh away his soul?</p><br>

<p>18:027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</p><br>

<p>18:027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon God?</p><br>

<p>18:027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty will I not conceal.</p><br>

<p>18:027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altogether vain?</p><br>

<p>18:027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p><br>

<p>18:027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p><br>

<p>18:027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widows shall not weep.</p><br>

<p>18:027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clay;</p><br>

<p>18:027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innocent shall divide the silver.</p><br>

<p>18:027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keeper maketh.</p><br>

<p>18:027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openeth his eyes, and he is not.</p><br>

<p>18:027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away in the night.</p><br>

<p>18:027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;storm hurleth him out of his place.</p><br>

<p>18:027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of his hand.</p><br>

<p>18:027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his place.</p><br>

<p>18:028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they fine it.</p><br>

<p>18:028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stone.</p><br>

<p>18:028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p><br>

<p>18:028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from men.</p><br>

<p>18:028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned up as it were fire.</p><br>

<p>18:028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of gold.</p><br>

<p>18:028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye hath not seen:</p><br>

<p>18:028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passed by it.</p><br>

<p>18:028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountains by the roots.</p><br>

<p>18:028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precious thing.</p><br>

<p>18:028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hid bringeth he forth to light.</p><br>

<p>18:028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding?</p><br>

<p>18:028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of the living.</p><br>

<p>18:028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with me.</p><br>

<p>18:028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the price thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onyx, or the sapphire.</p><br>

<p>18:028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p><br>

<p>18:028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of wisdom is above rubies.</p><br>

<p>18:028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valued with pure gold.</p><br>

<p>18:028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding?</p><br>

<p>18:028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the fowls of the air.</p><br>

<p>18:028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our ears.</p><br>

<p>18:028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof.</p><br>

<p>18:028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole heaven;</p><br>

<p>18:028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by measure.</p><br>

<p>18:028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lightning of the thunder:</p><br>

<p>18:028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searched it out.</p><br>

<p>18:028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved me;</p><br>

<p>18:029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walked through darkness;</p><br>

<p>18:029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon my tabernacle;</p><br>

<p>18:029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me;</p><br>

<p>18:029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rivers of oil;</p><br>

<p>18:029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my seat in the street!</p><br>

<p>18:029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stood up.</p><br>

<p>18:029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roof of their mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw me, it gave witness to me:</p><br>

<p>18:029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and him that had none to help him.</p><br>

<p>18:029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p><br>

<p>18:029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a robe and a diadem.</p><br>

<p>18:029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</p><br>

<p>18:029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searched out.</p><br>

<p>18:029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his teeth.</p><br>

<p>18:029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days as the sand.</p><br>

<p>18:029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night upon my branch.</p><br>

<p>18:029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p><br>

<p>18:029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsel.</p><br>

<p>18:029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon them.</p><br>

<p>18:029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p><br>

<p>18:029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my countenance they cast not down.</p><br>

<p>18:029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</p><br>

<p>18:030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my flock.</p><br>

<p>18:030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom old age was perished?</p><br>

<p>18:030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p><br>

<p>18:030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.</p><br>

<p>18:030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as after a thief;)</p><br>

<p>18:030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the rocks.</p><br>

<p>18:030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered together.</p><br>

<p>18:030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were viler than the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p><br>

<p>18:030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my face.</p><br>

<p>18:030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also let loose the bridle before me.</p><br>

<p>18:030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p><br>

<p>18:030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helper.</p><br>

<p>18:030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p><br>

<p>18:030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p><br>

<p>18:030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have taken hold upon me.</p><br>

<p>18:030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take no rest.</p><br>

<p>18:030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p><br>

<p>18:030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashes.</p><br>

<p>18:030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou regardest me not.</p><br>

<p>18:030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opposest thyself against me.</p><br>

<p>18:030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and dissolvest my substance.</p><br>

<p>18:030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed for all living.</p><br>

<p>18:030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cry in his destruction.</p><br>

<p>18:030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieved for the poor?</p><br>

<p>18:030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waited for light, there came darkness.</p><br>

<p>18:030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevented me.</p><br>

<p>18:030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the congregation.</p><br>

<p>18:030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p><br>

<p>18:030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p><br>

<p>18:030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice of them that weep.</p><br>

<p>18:031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a maid?</p><br>

<p>18:031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p><br>

<p>18:031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the workers of iniquity?</p><br>

<p>18:031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p><br>

<p>18:031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceit;</p><br>

<p>18:031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrity.</p><br>

<p>18:031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</p><br>

<p>18:031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rooted out.</p><br>

<p>18:031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait at my neighbour's door;</p><br>

<p>18:031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon her.</p><br>

<p>18:031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punished by the judges.</p><br>

<p>18:031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out all mine increase.</p><br>

<p>18:031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maidservant, when they contended with me;</p><br>

<p>18:031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what shall I answer him?</p><br>

<p>18:031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fashion us in the womb?</p><br>

<p>18:031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eyes of the widow to fail;</p><br>

<p>18:031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not eaten thereof;</p><br>

<p>18:031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)</p><br>

<p>18:031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without covering;</p><br>

<p>18:031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the fleece of my sheep;</p><br>

<p>18:031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my help in the gate:</p><br>

<p>18:031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken from the bone.</p><br>

<p>18:031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his highness I could not endure.</p><br>

<p>18:031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art my confidence;</p><br>

<p>18:031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand had gotten much;</p><br>

<p>18:031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brightness;</p><br>

<p>18:031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed my hand:</p><br>

<p>18:031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have denied the God that is above.</p><br>

<p>18:031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifted up myself when evil found him:</p><br>

<p>18:031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his soul.</p><br>

<p>18:031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p><br>

<p>18:031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doors to the traveller.</p><br>

<p>18:031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniquity in my bosom:</p><br>

<p>18:031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</p><br>

<p>18:031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a book.</p><br>

<p>18:031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crown to me.</p><br>

<p>18:031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would I go near unto him.</p><br>

<p>18:031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof complain;</p><br>

<p>18:031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p><br>

<p>18:031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barley. The words of Job are ended.</p><br>

<p>18:032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteous in his own eyes.</p><br>

<p>18:032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p><br>

<p>18:032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p><br>

<p>18:032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elder than he.</p><br>

<p>18:032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p><br>

<p>18:032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;durst not shew you mine opinion.</p><br>

<p>18:032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty giveth them understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinion.</p><br>

<p>18:032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whilst ye searched out what to say.</p><br>

<p>18:032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</p><br>

<p>18:032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him down, not man.</p><br>

<p>18:032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer him with your speeches.</p><br>

<p>18:032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking.</p><br>

<p>18:032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered no more;)</p><br>

<p>18:032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinion.</p><br>

<p>18:032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p><br>

<p>18:032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst like new bottles.</p><br>

<p>18:032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer.</p><br>

<p>18:032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me give flattering titles unto man.</p><br>

<p>18:032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would soon take me away.</p><br>

<p>18:033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my words.</p><br>

<p>18:033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall utter knowledge clearly.</p><br>

<p>18:033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath given me life.</p><br>

<p>18:033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand up.</p><br>

<p>18:033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formed out of the clay.</p><br>

<p>18:033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand be heavy upon thee.</p><br>

<p>18:033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice of thy words, saying,</p><br>

<p>18:033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there iniquity in me.</p><br>

<p>18:033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his enemy,</p><br>

<p>18:033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p><br>

<p>18:033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is greater than man.</p><br>

<p>18:033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of his matters.</p><br>

<p>18:033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p><br>

<p>18:033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p><br>

<p>18:033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction,</p><br>

<p>18:033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man.</p><br>

<p>18:033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perishing by the sword.</p><br>

<p>18:033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his bones with strong pain:</p><br>

<p>18:033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p><br>

<p>18:033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bones that were not seen stick out.</p><br>

<p>18:033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroyers.</p><br>

<p>18:033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p><br>

<p>18:033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p><br>

<p>18:033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the days of his youth:</p><br>

<p>18:033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man his righteousness.</p><br>

<p>18:033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p><br>

<p>18:033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall see the light.</p><br>

<p>18:033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</p><br>

<p>18:033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the light of the living.</p><br>

<p>18:033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak.</p><br>

<p>18:033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to justify thee.</p><br>

<p>18:033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p><br>

<p>18:034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have knowledge.</p><br>

<p>18:034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p><br>

<p>18:034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is good.</p><br>

<p>18:034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgression.</p><br>

<p>18:034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p><br>

<p>18:034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walketh with wicked men.</p><br>

<p>18:034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delight himself with God.</p><br>

<p>18:034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he should commit iniquity.</p><br>

<p>18:034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every man to find according to his ways.</p><br>

<p>18:034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty pervert judgment.</p><br>

<p>18:034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disposed the whole world?</p><br>

<p>18:034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit and his breath;</p><br>

<p>18:034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dust.</p><br>

<p>18:034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice of my words.</p><br>

<p>18:034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that is most just?</p><br>

<p>18:034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are ungodly?</p><br>

<p>18:034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all are the work of his hands.</p><br>

<p>18:034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without hand.</p><br>

<p>18:034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goings.</p><br>

<p>18:034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of iniquity may hide themselves.</p><br>

<p>18:034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into judgment with God.</p><br>

<p>18:034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others in their stead.</p><br>

<p>18:034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the night, so that they are destroyed.</p><br>

<p>18:034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p><br>

<p>18:034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his ways:</p><br>

<p>18:034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p><br>

<p>18:034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done against a nation, or against a man only:</p><br>

<p>18:034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p><br>

<p>18:034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p><br>

<p>18:034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will do no more.</p><br>

<p>18:034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore speak what thou knowest.</p><br>

<p>18:034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me.</p><br>

<p>18:034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answers for wicked men.</p><br>

<p>18:034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p><br>

<p>18:035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness is more than God's?</p><br>

<p>18:035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</p><br>

<p>18:035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p><br>

<p>18:035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are higher than thou.</p><br>

<p>18:035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p><br>

<p>18:035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he of thine hand?</p><br>

<p>18:035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness may profit the son of man.</p><br>

<p>18:035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mighty.</p><br>

<p>18:035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night;</p><br>

<p>18:035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p><br>

<p>18:035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of evil men.</p><br>

<p>18:035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regard it.</p><br>

<p>18:035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p><br>

<p>18:035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</p><br>

<p>18:035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words without knowledge.</p><br>

<p>18:036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak on God's behalf.</p><br>

<p>18:036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness to my Maker.</p><br>

<p>18:036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge is with thee.</p><br>

<p>18:036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength and wisdom.</p><br>

<p>18:036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor.</p><br>

<p>18:036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are exalted.</p><br>

<p>18:036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affliction;</p><br>

<p>18:036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have exceeded.</p><br>

<p>18:036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they return from iniquity.</p><br>

<p>18:036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p><br>

<p>18:036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall die without knowledge.</p><br>

<p>18:036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he bindeth them.</p><br>

<p>18:036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p><br>

<p>18:036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ears in oppression.</p><br>

<p>18:036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</p><br>

<p>18:036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and justice take hold on thee.</p><br>

<p>18:036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p><br>

<p>18:036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength.</p><br>

<p>18:036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p><br>

<p>18:036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than affliction.</p><br>

<p>18:036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p><br>

<p>18:036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought iniquity?</p><br>

<p>18:036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p><br>

<p>18:036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p><br>

<p>18:036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of his years be searched out.</p><br>

<p>18:036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the vapour thereof:</p><br>

<p>18:036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</p><br>

<p>18:036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noise of his tabernacle?</p><br>

<p>18:036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottom of the sea.</p><br>

<p>18:036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundance.</p><br>

<p>18:036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</p><br>

<p>18:036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning the vapour.</p><br>

<p>18:037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place.</p><br>

<p>18:037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goeth out of his mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ends of the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p><br>

<p>18:037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he, which we cannot comprehend.</p><br>

<p>18:037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p><br>

<p>18:037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work.</p><br>

<p>18:037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p><br>

<p>18:037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;north.</p><br>

<p>18:037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters is straitened.</p><br>

<p>18:037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his bright cloud:</p><br>

<p>18:037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth.</p><br>

<p>18:037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land, or for mercy.</p><br>

<p>18:037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wondrous works of God.</p><br>

<p>18:037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his cloud to shine?</p><br>

<p>18:037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p><br>

<p>18:037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;south wind?</p><br>

<p>18:037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a molten looking glass?</p><br>

<p>18:037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speech by reason of darkness.</p><br>

<p>18:037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be swallowed up.</p><br>

<p>18:037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p><br>

<p>18:037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majesty.</p><br>

<p>18:037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not afflict.</p><br>

<p>18:037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of heart.</p><br>

<p>18:038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p><br>

<p>18:038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and answer thou me.</p><br>

<p>18:038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare, if thou hast understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath stretched the line upon it?</p><br>

<p>18:038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the corner stone thereof;</p><br>

<p>18:038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouted for joy?</p><br>

<p>18:038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it had issued out of the womb?</p><br>

<p>18:038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a swaddlingband for it,</p><br>

<p>18:038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</p><br>

<p>18:038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p><br>

<p>18:038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dayspring to know his place;</p><br>

<p>18:038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wicked might be shaken out of it?</p><br>

<p>18:038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p><br>

<p>18:038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arm shall be broken.</p><br>

<p>18:038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walked in the search of the depth?</p><br>

<p>18:038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p><br>

<p>18:038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowest it all.</p><br>

<p>18:038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where is the place thereof,</p><br>

<p>18:038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?</p><br>

<p>18:038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of thy days is great?</p><br>

<p>18:038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen the treasures of the hail,</p><br>

<p>18:038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day of battle and war?</p><br>

<p>18:038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wind upon the earth?</p><br>

<p>18:038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p><br>

<p>18:038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness, wherein there is no man;</p><br>

<p>18:038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the tender herb to spring forth?</p><br>

<p>18:038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p><br>

<p>18:038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who hath gendered it?</p><br>

<p>18:038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is frozen.</p><br>

<p>18:038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bands of Orion?</p><br>

<p>18:038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guide Arcturus with his sons?</p><br>

<p>18:038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dominion thereof in the earth?</p><br>

<p>18:038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters may cover thee?</p><br>

<p>18:038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Here we are?</p><br>

<p>18:038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding to the heart?</p><br>

<p>18:038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles of heaven,</p><br>

<p>18:038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together?</p><br>

<p>18:038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the young lions,</p><br>

<p>18:038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in wait?</p><br>

<p>18:038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</p><br>

<p>18:039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p><br>

<p>18:039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time when they bring forth?</p><br>

<p>18:039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast out their sorrows.</p><br>

<p>18:039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they go forth, and return not unto them.</p><br>

<p>18:039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bands of the wild ass?</p><br>

<p>18:039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his dwellings.</p><br>

<p>18:039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the crying of the driver.</p><br>

<p>18:039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after every green thing.</p><br>

<p>18:039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crib?</p><br>

<p>18:039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p><br>

<p>18:039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou leave thy labour to him?</p><br>

<p>18:039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather it into thy barn?</p><br>

<p>18:039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feathers unto the ostrich?</p><br>

<p>18:039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</p><br>

<p>18:039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beast may break them.</p><br>

<p>18:039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;</p><br>

<p>18:039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imparted to her understanding.</p><br>

<p>18:039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse and his rider.</p><br>

<p>18:039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with thunder?</p><br>

<p>18:039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nostrils is terrible.</p><br>

<p>18:039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goeth on to meet the armed men.</p><br>

<p>18:039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back from the sword.</p><br>

<p>18:039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shield.</p><br>

<p>18:039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p><br>

<p>18:039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouting.</p><br>

<p>18:039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the south?</p><br>

<p>18:039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high?</p><br>

<p>18:039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock, and the strong place.</p><br>

<p>18:039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off.</p><br>

<p>18:039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is she.</p><br>

<p>18:040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p><br>

<p>18:040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand upon my mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will proceed no further.</p><br>

<p>18:040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said,</p><br>

<p>18:040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare thou unto me.</p><br>

<p>18:040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou mayest be righteous?</p><br>

<p>18:040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like him?</p><br>

<p>18:040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself with glory and beauty.</p><br>

<p>18:040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is proud, and abase him.</p><br>

<p>18:040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down the wicked in their place.</p><br>

<p>18:040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret.</p><br>

<p>18:040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can save thee.</p><br>

<p>18:040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an ox.</p><br>

<p>18:040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;navel of his belly.</p><br>

<p>18:040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapped together.</p><br>

<p>18:040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bars of iron.</p><br>

<p>18:040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sword to approach unto him.</p><br>

<p>18:040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beasts of the field play.</p><br>

<p>18:040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fens.</p><br>

<p>18:040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the brook compass him about.</p><br>

<p>18:040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</p><br>

<p>18:041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cord which thou lettest down?</p><br>

<p>18:041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a thorn?</p><br>

<p>18:041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words unto thee?</p><br>

<p>18:041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant for ever?</p><br>

<p>18:041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thy maidens?</p><br>

<p>18:041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him among the merchants?</p><br>

<p>18:041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fish spears?</p><br>

<p>18:041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p><br>

<p>18:041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even at the sight of him?</p><br>

<p>18:041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand before me?</p><br>

<p>18:041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the whole heaven is mine.</p><br>

<p>18:041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proportion.</p><br>

<p>18:041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him with his double bridle?</p><br>

<p>18:041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round about.</p><br>

<p>18:041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seal.</p><br>

<p>18:041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p><br>

<p>18:041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be sundered.</p><br>

<p>18:041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyelids of the morning.</p><br>

<p>18:041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out.</p><br>

<p>18:041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caldron.</p><br>

<p>18:041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p><br>

<p>18:041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him.</p><br>

<p>18:041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves; they cannot be moved.</p><br>

<p>18:041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nether millstone.</p><br>

<p>18:041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of breakings they purify themselves.</p><br>

<p>18:041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dart, nor the habergeon.</p><br>

<p>18:041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p><br>

<p>18:041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him into stubble.</p><br>

<p>18:041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spear.</p><br>

<p>18:041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the mire.</p><br>

<p>18:041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a pot of ointment.</p><br>

<p>18:041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be hoary.</p><br>

<p>18:041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p><br>

<p>18:041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of pride.</p><br>

<p>18:042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p><br>

<p>18:042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be withholden from thee.</p><br>

<p>18:042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, which I knew not.</p><br>

<p>18:042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and declare thou unto me.</p><br>

<p>18:042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye seeth thee.</p><br>

<p>18:042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p><br>

<p>18:042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath.</p><br>

<p>18:042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant Job.</p><br>

<p>18:042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD also accepted Job.</p><br>

<p>18:042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before.</p><br>

<p>18:042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money, and every one an earring of gold.</p><br>

<p>18:042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she asses.</p><br>

<p>18:042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p><br>

<p>18:042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</p><br>

<p>18:042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their brethren.</p><br>

<p>18:042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</p><br>

<p>18:042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.</p><br>

<pre>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE, KING JAMES, B18 ***

****** This file should be named bib1810h.htm or bib1810h.zip *******

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, bib1811h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, bib1810ah.htm


This eBook was produced by David Widger
Additional credits are noted in the header.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date. This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
