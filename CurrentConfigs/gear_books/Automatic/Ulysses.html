 <h2>
 ? I ?
 </h2>
 <p>
 Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
 lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,
 ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He
 held the bowl aloft and intoned:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and
 blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking
 mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him
 and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his
 head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top
 of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that
 blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair,
 grained and hued like pale oak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl
 smartly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Back to barracks! he said sternly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He added in a preacher's tone:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
 and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment.
 A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
 awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
 with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered
 through the calm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off
 the current, will you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
 about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
 sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A
 pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient
 Greek!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
 laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
 halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he
 propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
 lathered cheeks and neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
 Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We
 must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty
 quid?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ceasing, he began to shave with care.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, my love?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He
 thinks you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with
 money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus,
 you have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you
 is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shaved warily over his chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where
 is his guncase?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the
 dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting
 a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If
 he stays on here I am off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from
 his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Scutter! he cried thickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper
 pocket, said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty
 crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then,
 gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets:
 snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can't you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
 oakpale hair stirring slightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a grey
 sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. <i>Epi oinopa
 ponton</i>. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them
 in the original. <i>Thalatta! Thalatta</i>! She is our great sweet mother.
 Come and look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
 down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
 Kingstown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she
 won't let me have anything to do with you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
 asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to
 think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
 pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
 smile curled his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
 mummer of them all!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
 his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
 Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a
 dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
 loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
 breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted
 ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great
 sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline
 held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside
 her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from
 her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
 and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be.
 God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
 stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You
 look damn well when you're dressed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
 Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey
 trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
 smooth skin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
 smokeblue mobile eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
 says you have g.p.i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General
 paralysis of the insane!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
 in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and
 the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong
 wellknit trunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a
 crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face
 for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does
 her all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.
 Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
 Wilde were only alive to see you!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a
 servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him
 round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had
 thrust them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
 God knows you have more spirit than any of them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
 cold steelpen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap
 downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and thinks
 you're not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to
 Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only
 work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cranly's arm. His arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only
 one that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you up
 your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll bring
 down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive
 Kempthorpe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:
 they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall
 expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
 ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table,
 with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor's
 shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't want to be
 debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
 gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower on
 the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except
 at night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm
 quite frank with you. What have you against me now?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the
 water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
 fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
 anxiety in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my
 mother's death?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and
 sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to
 get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
 drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You said, Stephen answered, <i>O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is
 beastly dead.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
 Mulligan's cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shook his constraint from him nervously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You
 saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
 Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly
 thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel down
 to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because
 you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong
 way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not
 functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups
 off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her last wish in
 death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired mute
 from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn't mean to offend
 the memory of your mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds
 which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing
 over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim.
 Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the
 fever of his cheeks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A voice within the tower called loudly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you up there, Mulligan?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned towards Stephen and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
 Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with
 the roof:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the
 moody brooding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the
 stairhead:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>And no more turn aside and brood
 Upon love's bitter mystery
 For Fergus rules the brazen cars.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
 stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
 water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the
 dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
 harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
 shimmering on the dim tide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper
 green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song: I sang
 it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was
 open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her
 bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen:
 love's bitter mystery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where now?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a
 gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny
 window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the
 pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>I am the boy
 That can enjoy
 Invisibility.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>And no more turn aside and brood.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
 brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
 approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting
 for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails
 reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
 loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
 bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me
 alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured
 face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their
 knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. <i>Liliata rutilantium te
 confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No, mother! Let me be and let me live.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Kinch ahoy!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
 staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,
 heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines
 is apologising for waking us last night. It's all right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all
 our sakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His head disappeared and reappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever.
 Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us
 one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?If you want it, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll
 have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
 sovereigns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
 tune with a Cockney accent:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>O, won't we have a merry time,
 Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
 On coronation,
 Coronation day!
 O, won't we have a merry time
 On coronation day!</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
 forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there
 all day, forgotten friendship?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
 smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So
 I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet
 the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form
 moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow
 glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the
 high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and
 fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will
 you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
 hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the
 inner doors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Have you the key? a voice asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He howled, without looking up from the fire:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Kinch!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set
 ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway,
 looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to
 wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he
 carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down
 heavily and sighed with relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not
 a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,
 come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where's
 the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
 the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after
 eight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in
 the locker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want
 Sandycove milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That woman is coming up with the milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from
 his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag.
 Here, I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates,
 saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you
 do make strong tea, don't you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's
 wheedling voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
 makes water I makes water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>So I do, Mrs Cahill,</i> says she. <i>Begob, ma'am,</i> says Mrs
 Cahill, <i>God send you don't make them in the one pot.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on
 his knife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five
 lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
 Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot
 spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons,
 pray?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
 Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
 and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
 rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?For old Mary Ann
 She doesn't care a damn.
 But, hising up her petticoats...</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The milk, sir!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently
 of the collector of prepuces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How much, sir? asked the old woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A quart, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
 milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a
 tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
 messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching
 by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool,
 her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her
 whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman,
 names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal
 serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a
 messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he
 could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their
 cups.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Taste it, sir, she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drank at her bidding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
 loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.
 Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust,
 horsedung and consumptives' spits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Look at that now, she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
 that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
 slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is
 of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's
 likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be
 silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from
 the west, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
 Irish in Ireland.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak
 the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely.
 Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
 milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines said to her:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen filled again the three cups.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at
 twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
 mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a
 shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
 buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
 trouser pockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick
 rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his
 fingers and cried:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A miracle!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We'll owe twopence, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good
 morning, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?Heart of my heart, were it more,
 More would be laid at your feet.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He turned to Stephen and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and
 bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
 expects that every man this day will do his duty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
 national library today.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he said to Haines:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let
 honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
 loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
 Conscience. Yet here's a spot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the
 symbol of Irish art is deuced good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth
 of tone:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
 thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the
 hammock, said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I don't know, I'm sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
 said with coarse vigour:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From
 the milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come
 along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?From me, Kinch, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a suddenly changed tone he added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else
 they are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
 Let us get out of the kip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
 resignedly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He emptied his pockets on to the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There's your snotrag, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
 chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
 rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we'll
 simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots.
 Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict
 myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking
 hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
 doorway:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you coming, you fellows?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come
 out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
 with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And going forth he met Butterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and,
 as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.
 He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did you bring the key?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
 bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines asked:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you pay rent for this tower?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were
 on the sea. But ours is the <i>omphalos</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas
 Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till
 I have a few pints in me first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
 primrose waistcoat:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
 It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is
 Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
 father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
 loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it
 is rather long to tell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
 tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. <i>That beetles
 o'er his base into the sea,</i> isn't it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not
 speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap
 dusty mourning between their gay attires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The
 seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
 smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking
 by the Muglins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said
 bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with
 the Father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at
 them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
 suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a
 doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began
 to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
 My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.
 With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
 So here's to disciples and Calvary.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He held up a forefinger of warning.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?If anyone thinks that I amn't divine
 He'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine
 But have to drink water and wish it were plain
 That i make when the wine becomes water again.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward
 to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
 wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
 And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
 What's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
 And Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
 winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh wind
 that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
 said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a
 believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it
 somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
 the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
 personal God.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green
 stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
 sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it
 open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards
 Stephen in the shell of his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe
 or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a
 personal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
 example of free thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.
 Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My
 familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the
 path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that
 key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the
 key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?After all, Haines began...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
 all unkind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are
 your own master, it seems to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an
 Italian.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Italian? Haines said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising,
 and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
 like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather
 unfairly. It seems history is to blame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of their
 brazen bells: <i>et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:</i>
 the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a
 chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus,
 the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their
 chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her
 heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the
 brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life
 long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine,
 spurning Christ's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch
 Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan
 had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The
 void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and
 a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host, who
 defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
 shields.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. <i>Zut! Nom de Dieu!</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one.
 I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
 That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?She's making for Bullock harbour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way
 when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a
 swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.
 Here I am.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a
 stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A
 young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his
 green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is the brother with you, Malachi?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
 thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
 the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water
 glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over
 his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
 and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
 and breastbone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur
 of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl,
 Lily?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
 money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is she up the pole?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Better ask Seymour that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
 tritely:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Redheaded women buck like goats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the <i>Uebermensch.</i>
 Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes
 lay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you going in here, Malachi?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes. Make room in the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
 middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone,
 smoking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen turned away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm going, Mulligan, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise
 flat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
 clothes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
 Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
 Zarathustra.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His plump body plunged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
 path and smiling at wild Irish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked along the upwardcurving path.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Liliata rutilantium.
 Turma circumdet.
 Iubilantium te virginum.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
 not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning the
 curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal's,
 far out on the water, round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Usurper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tarentum, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Very good. Well?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There was a battle, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Very good. Where?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boy's blank face asked the blank window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
 memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings of
 excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
 masonry, and time one livid final flame. What's left us then?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
 gorescarred book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are done
 for.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill
 above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon
 his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?End of Pyrrhus, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
 between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
 the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
 that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at
 his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more
 loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
 what is a pier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
 bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
 whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All.
 With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes:
 their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering
 in the struggle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The words troubled their gaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild drink
 and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at
 the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement
 master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the
 smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often
 heard, their land a pawnshop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
 been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded
 them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
 possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing
 that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave,
 weaver of the wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tell us a story, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 -<i>-Weep no more,</i> Comyn said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Go on then, Talbot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And the story, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of
 his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
 For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
 Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
 Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out
 into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had
 read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a
 delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains
 about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in
 my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
 brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of
 thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the
 soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
 forms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Talbot repeated:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
 Through the dear might...</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 ?Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
 just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven
 hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and on mine. It
 lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. To
 Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long look from dark eyes,
 a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's looms. Ay.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
 My father gave me seeds to sow.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Half day, sir. Thursday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding
 together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, ask me, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A hard one, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?This is the riddle, Stephen said:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>The cock crew,
 The sky was blue:
 The bells in heaven
 Were striking eleven.
 'Tis time for this poor soul
 To go to heaven.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 What is that?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Again, sir. We didn't hear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
 Cochrane said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is it, sir? We give it up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
 echoed dismay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hockey!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
 they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
 clamour of their boots and tongues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
 copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and
 through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull
 and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a
 snail's bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the
 headline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature
 with blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show
 them to you, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
 copy them off the board, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
 bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.
 But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a
 squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from
 her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother's
 prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no
 more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of
 rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot
 and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a
 heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with
 merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the
 earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra
 that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent peered askance
 through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
 hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
 their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
 traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
 the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement,
 flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a
 darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word
 of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of
 shame flickering behind his dull skin. <i>Amor matris:</i> subjective and
 objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him
 and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood
 bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine
 is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark
 palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants,
 willing to be dethroned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sum was done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
 copybook back to his bench.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen
 said as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sargent!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
 field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr
 Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he
 had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
 turned his angry white moustache.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I
 restore order here.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice cried
 sternly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is the matter? What is it now?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
 round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
 of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in
 the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base
 treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of
 purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the
 gentiles: world without end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
 rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?First, our little financial settlement, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
 slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid
 them carefully on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved over
 the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and
 leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and this, the
 scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure, hollow
 shells.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his
 hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is
 for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
 haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of
 beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
 misery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out
 somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find
 them very handy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Answer something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times now.
 Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant if I
 will.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You
 don't know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long
 as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare
 say? <i>Put but money in thy purse.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Iago, Stephen murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes,
 but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do
 you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's
 mouth?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
 history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He
 tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. <i>I
 paid my way.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Good man, good man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life.</i> Can
 you feel that? <i>I owe nothing.</i> Can you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
 Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple,
 two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds,
 half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks' board.
 The lump I have is useless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel
 it. We are a generous people but we must also be just.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
 shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice
 said. I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the
 famine in '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of
 the union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your
 communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
 splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
 planters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
 down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side.
 But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are
 all Irish, all kings' sons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Alas, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Per vias rectas</i>, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He
 voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of
 Down to do so.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Lal the ral the ra
 The rocky road to Dublin.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John! Soft
 day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on to
 Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
 with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
 Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
 off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, <i>the dictates of
 common sense.</i> Just a moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and,
 muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
 sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
 around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
 heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of Westminster's
 Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, <i>prix de Paris</i>, 1866. Elfin
 riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king's
 colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this
 allimportant question...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
 mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of
 the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even money the
 favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by
 after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman,
 a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,
 the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems to
 be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.
 Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a
 shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about
 the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
 opinions on the matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i>
 which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
 industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
 European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
 channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
 agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was
 no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.
 Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at Murzsteg,
 lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous
 offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In
 every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the
 hospitality of your columns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at
 the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be
 cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
 regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer
 to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department.
 Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by...
 intrigues by... backstairs influence by...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
 jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the
 signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's
 vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are
 standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.
 Old England is dying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
 broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>The harlot's cry from street to street
 Shall weave old England's windingsheet.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he
 halted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew
 or gentile, is he not?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can
 see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
 earth to this day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
 prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
 uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
 hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
 slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew
 the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience
 to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the
 roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of
 wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who has not? Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways
 open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to
 awake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What
 if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
 history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That is God.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Mr Deasy asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
 between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.

 ?I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors
 and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
 better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years
 the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers
 to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, prince of
 Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but
 not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will
 fight for the right till the end.

 Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, sir, he began...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
 at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
 wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A learner rather, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And here what will you learn more?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Deasy shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the
 great teacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen rustled the sheets again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?As regards these, he began.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
 published at once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i> Telegraph. Irish Homestead.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
 editors slightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr
 Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at
 the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
 see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?The Evening Telegraph...</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have
 to answer that letter from my cousin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
 Thank you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
 like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
 hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The
 lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless
 terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new
 name: the bullockbefriending bard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mr Dedalus!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Just one moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
 being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that?
 No. And do you know why?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He frowned sternly on the bright air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
 rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his
 lifted arms waving to the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
 stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
 spangles, dancing coins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
 through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and
 seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:
 coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he
 was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his
 sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <i>maestro
 di color che sanno</i>. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane,
 adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if
 not a door. Shut your eyes and see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
 shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A
 very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the
 <i>nacheinander</i>. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
 audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
 o'er his base, fell through the <i>nebeneinander</i> ineluctably! I am
 getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it:
 they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, <i>nebeneinander</i>.
 Sounds solid: made by the mallet of <i>Los Demiurgos</i>. Am I walking
 into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick. Wild
 sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a'. Won't you come to Sandymount,
 Madeline the mare?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.
 No, agallop: <i>deline the mare</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I open
 and am for ever in the black adiaphane. <i>Basta</i>! I will see if I can
 see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without
 end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, <i>Frauenzimmer</i>:
 and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the
 silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother. Number
 one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in the beach.
 From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the
 late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood
 lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the
 bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords
 of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic
 monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put
 me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.
 Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,
 whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
 everlasting. Womb of sin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man with
 my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They
 clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages He
 willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A <i>lex eterna</i> stays
 about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
 consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring his
 life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred
 heresiarch' In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With
 beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a
 widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves. The
 whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half
 twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yes, I must.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara's or not? My
 consubstantial father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist brother
 Stephen lately? No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt
 Sally? Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and and tell
 us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things I married into!
 De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother,
 the cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter
 sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no
 wonder, by Christ!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take me
 for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's Stephen, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Let him in. Let Stephen in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We thought you were someone else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the
 hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the
 upper moiety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Morrow, nephew.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the
 eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common
 searches and a writ of <i>Duces Tecum</i>. A bogoak frame over his bald
 head: Wilde's <i>Requiescat</i>. The drone of his misleading whistle
 brings Walter back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bathing Crissie, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, uncle Richie...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Uncle Richie, really...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Walter squints vainly for a chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.
 Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
 here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the better.
 We have nothing in the house but backache pills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>All'erta</i>!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drones bars of Ferrando's <i>aria di sortita</i>. The grandest number,
 Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air,
 his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This wind is sweeter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you had
 an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them,
 Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's library
 where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The
 hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from
 them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs
 stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck
 Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father,?furious dean,
 what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! <i>Descende, calve, ut ne
 amplius decalveris</i>. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see
 him me clambering down to the footpace (<i>descende</i>!), clutching a
 monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace
 and echo, assisting about the altar's horns, the snorted Latin of
 jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat
 with the fat of kidneys of wheat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.
 Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.
 Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
 cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,
 invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his
 brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second
 bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard
 (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were
 awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might
 not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the
 fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet
 street. <i>O si, certo</i>! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned
 round a squaw. More tell me, more still!! On the top of the Howth tram
 alone crying to the rain: Naked women! <i>naked women</i>! What about
 that, eh?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What about what? What else were they invented for?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young. You
 bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly,
 striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell
 no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you
 read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O yes, W.
 Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies
 to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including
 Alexandria? Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a
 mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one
 reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one
 with one who once...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a damp
 crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered
 pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome
 sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage
 breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man's
 ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle stood up, stogged
 to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful
 thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning
 nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a
 dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen
 and master mariners. Human shells.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?
 Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand
 towards the Pigeonhouse.

 <i>?Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?</i>

 <i>?c'est le pigeon, Joseph.</i>

 Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.
 Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a bird, he lapped
 the sweet <i>lait chaud</i> with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face.
 Lap, <i>lapin.</i> He hopes to win in the <i>gros lots</i>. About the
 nature of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me <i>La Vie de
 Jesus</i> by M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.

 My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want puce

 name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: <i>physiques, chimiques et naturelles</i>.
 Aha. Eating your groatsworth of <i>mou en civet</i>, fleshpots of Egypt,
 elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural tone: when I was
 in Paris; <i>boul' Mich'</i>, I used to. Yes, used to carry punched
 tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere.
 Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was
 seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat,
 nose. <i>Lui, c'est moi</i>. You seem to have enjoyed yourself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a
 dispossessed. With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging door
 of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger toothache. <i>Encore
 deux minutes</i>. Look clock. Must get. <i>Ferme</i>. Hired dog! Shoot him
 to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass
 buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt? O, that's all
 right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that's all right. Shake a
 shake. O, that's all only all right.

 <p>
 You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery
 Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from
 their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: <i>Euge! Euge</i>! Pretending to speak
 broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the
 slimy pier at Newhaven. <i>Comment?</i> Rich booty you brought back; <i>Le
 Tutu</i>, five tattered numbers of <i>Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge</i>;
 a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:

 His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by
 the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone
 mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is there,
 the slender trees, the lemon houses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of
 farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air.
 Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the kerchiefed
 housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In Rodot's Yvonne
 and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering with gold teeth
 <i>chaussons</i> of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the <i>pus</i> of
 <i>flan breton</i>. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers,
 curled conquistadores.

 Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
 smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white.
 About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. <i>Un demi setier!</i>
 A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me at his
 beck. <i>Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais, nous,
 Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!</i> She thought you wanted a cheese <i>hollandais</i>.
 Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial. There was a fellow
 I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial.
 Well: <i>slainte</i>! Around the slabbed tables the tangle of wined
 breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our saucestained
 plates, the green fairy's fang thrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the
 Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E,
 pimander, good shepherd of men. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes
 our common cause. You're your father's son. I know the voice. His fustian
 shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.

 Old hag with the yellow teeth. <i>Vieille ogresse</i> with the <i>dents

 faire</i>, she said, <i>Tous les messieurs</i>. Not this <i>Monsieur</i>,
 I said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let

 The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose
 tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw
 facebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got away,
 authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms,
 drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed,
 wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.

 Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you.
 I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he
 prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of
 Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in
 the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides, Egan
 of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day's stations, the dingy
 printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night
 in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.
 Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast
 man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy
 cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's. Spurned and
 undespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a
 job one time. <i>Mon fils</i>, soldier of France. I taught him to sing <i>The
 boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades</i>. Know that old lay? I taught
 Patrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore.
 Goes like this. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.

 He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. The
 new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of
 brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? He
 stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.
 Turn back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new
 sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans the
 shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking,
 creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue
 night. In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my
 obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it? He
 has the key. I will not sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of
 a silent tower, entombing their?blind bodies, the panthersahib and
 his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his feet up from the suck and
 turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep all. My soul walks
 with me, form of forms. So in the moon's midwatches I pace the path above
 the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore's tempting flood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back
 then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge
 and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
 grike.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the
 gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. <i>Un coche ensabl?</i> Louis Veuillot
 called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind have
 silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of
 weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones.
 Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one bang on the
 ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones
 for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. Lord,
 is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of
 others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away,
 walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two
 maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you.
 No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
 bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs
 of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of
 gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting,
 hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of
 jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives, running, scaling,
 hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their
 blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen
 Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke
 to no-one: none to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I just
 simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <i>Terribilia meditans</i>. A
 primrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you
 pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The
 Bruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York's
 false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and
 Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned. All
 kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved men from
 drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers who mocked
 Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of... We don't want
 any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he did? A boat
 would be near, a lifebuoy. <i>Nat?rlich</i>, put there for you. Would you
 or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden's
 rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I would want
 to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft. When I put my
 face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's behind me? Out
 quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides,
 sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under
 my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man.
 His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I... With him
 together down... I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all
 sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off
 like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming
 gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded
 back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck,
 trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with
 stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the
 wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling,
 unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from
 farther out, waves and waves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused
 their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to
 them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at
 them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came
 towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his jaws.
 His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's
 gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round
 it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog
 all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the
 ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor
 dogsbody's body.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
 sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk
 back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he
 lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
 against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
 quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
 hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
 Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,
 dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
 again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
 spousebreach, vulturing the dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.
 Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That
 man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my
 face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red
 carpet spread. You will see who.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet out
 of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
 strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian
 and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit
 crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair trailed. Behind her
 lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When night hides her body's
 flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.
 Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts.
 Buss her, wap in rogues' rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A
 shefiend's whiteness under her rancid rags. Fumbally's lane that night:
 the tanyard smells.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>White thy fambles, red thy gan
 And thy quarrons dainty is.
 Couch a hogshead with me then.
 In the darkmans clip and kiss.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, <i>frate porcospino</i>.
 Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: <i>thy quarrons
 dainty is</i>. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads
 jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their
 pockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Passing now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I am
 not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming
 sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps,
 trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her
 wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, <i>oinopa ponton</i>,
 a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign
 calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death,
 ghostcandled. <i>Omnis caro ad te veniet</i>. He comes, pale vampire,
 through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her
 mouth's kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.
 Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
 ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
 wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's letter.
 Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his
 back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.
 That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the
 farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining
 in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his
 augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea,
 unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I
 throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.
 Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever
 anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere
 to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil
 of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems
 hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat: yes, that's right.
 Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah,
 see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick.
 You find my words dark. Darkness is in our souls do you not think?
 Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a
 woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue
 hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of
 the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
 Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were
 going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse
 of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a
 lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she
 wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned
 with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings, <i>piuttosto</i>. Where are
 your wits?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
 soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad
 too. Touch, touch me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
 note and pencil into a pock his hat. His hat down on his eyes. That is
 Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. <i>Et
 vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona</i>. Alo! <i>Bonjour</i>. Welcome as the
 flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes
 the southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the
 faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the
 tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>And no more turn aside and brood.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs, <i>nebeneinander</i>.
 He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another's foot had nested
 warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. But you
 were delighted when Esther Osvalt's shoe went on you: girl I knew in
 Paris. <i>Tiens, quel petit pied!</i> Staunch friend, a brother soul:
 Wilde's love that dare not speak its name. His arm: Cranly's arm. He now
 will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I am. All or not at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
 greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float
 away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
 low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a
 fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of
 waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops:
 flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It
 flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
 sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
 swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:
 lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
 they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
 awaiting the fullness of their times, <i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias
 patiens ingemiscit</i>. To no end gathered; vainly then released,
 forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of
 lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a
 toil of waters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he said.
 Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift
 of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite
 from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward. There he is.
 Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have
 him. Easy now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a
 spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God
 becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
 mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous
 offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the
 stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
 known to man. Old Father Ocean. <i>Prix de paris</i>: beware of
 imitations. Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
 Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, <i>Lucifer,
 dico, qui nescit occasum</i>. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal
 shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.
 Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end.
 By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the
 glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman
 poet. <i>Gi?</i>. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur
 Drumont, gentleman journalist. <i>Gi?</i>. My teeth are very bad. Why, I
 wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I
 wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman.
 Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
 carefully. For the rest let look who will.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Behind. Perhaps there is someone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air
 high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees,
 homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. +

 <p>
 Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He
 liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
 liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he
 liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
 faintly scented urine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
 her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the
 kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a
 bit peckish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The coals were reddening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like her
 plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob
 and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout
 stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly round
 a leg of the table with tail on high.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mkgnao!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
 table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my
 head. Prr.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the
 gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the
 green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Milk for the pussens, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we
 understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel.
 Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I look
 like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the
 chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and
 long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
 narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the
 dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him, poured
 warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
 three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they
 can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind
 of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
 drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a
 mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better a
 pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower,
 then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap
 better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
 the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter
 she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He said softly in the bare hall:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You don't want anything for breakfast?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A sleepy soft grunt answered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as
 she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must
 get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any
 little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style. Ah
 yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction. Got a short knock.
 Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that was. I
 rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still he had brains enough
 to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and
 his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback
 pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.
 The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's high
 grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of
 paper. Quite safe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In
 the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe. No
 use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the
 halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently
 over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back
 anyhow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
 seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a warm
 day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black
 conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in that
 light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as he
 walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our daily
 but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you
 feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel
 round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever
 never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land,
 come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy's big
 moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned
 streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man,
 Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of
 sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander
 along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on to
 sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a
 scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass
 on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her
 children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged.
 Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A
 girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I
 pass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of
 the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What
 Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the <i>Freeman</i> leader: a
 homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank
 of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun
 rising up in the north-west.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the
 flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
 whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end
 of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as position.
 Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the
 cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad.
 Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold
 Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the
 aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to
 a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to tell you?
 What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they'd only be
 an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor
 Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
 doorway:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day, Mr O'Rourke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day to you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Lovely weather, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?'Tis all that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county
 Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,
 they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the
 competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without
 passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three
 and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On
 the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town
 travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job, see?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of
 stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint
 Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps
 memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou.
 Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their joggerfry.
 Mine. Slieve Bloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
 polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in
 his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packed
 with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm
 breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood
 by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the
 items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a
 half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his
 name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers
 allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She
 does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
 blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth
 on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. Moses
 Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle
 cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the
 title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white
 heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their
 pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed
 boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated
 hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. He
 held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft
 subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
 sausages and made a red grimace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Now, my miss, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
 please?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
 slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
 morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
 outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed
 down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails
 too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of
 disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a
 constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable.
 Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Threepence, please.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
 Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them on
 the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by
 disc, into the till.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thank you, sir. Another time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after
 an instant. No: better not: another time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good morning, he said, moving away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good morning, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No sign. Gone. What matter?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
 planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government
 and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and
 construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You pay
 eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges,
 almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.
 Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as
 owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly
 instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
 olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars,
 eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the
 taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too.
 Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And Mastiansky with
 the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron's
 basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to
 the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.
 Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moisel
 told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must be
 without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
 Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap
 ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled
 dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn't see. Chap
 you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian
 captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the
 rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea:
 no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves,
 grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down:
 the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea
 in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race.
 A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.
 The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to
 captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now.
 Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of
 the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Desolation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
 into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,
 chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here
 now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of
 the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down.
 Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?
 Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:
 parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell the
 gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample
 bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
 sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl
 with gold hair on the wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them.
 Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs
 Marion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Poldy!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow
 twilight towards her tousled head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who are the letters for?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.
 And a letter for you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
 knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you want the blind up?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
 glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That do? he asked, turning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?She got the things, she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly
 with a snug sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The kettle is boiling, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
 linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Poldy!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Scald the teapot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
 rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
 kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
 the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of
 butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
 hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they
 won't eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her
 and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He
 sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new
 tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's seaside
 girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Derby, smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,
 wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of
 folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
 You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
 I'd rather have you without a farthing
 Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous
 old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the
 little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the
 parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we laughed.
 Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
 teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?
 Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
 upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on
 the chair by the bedhead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What a time you were! she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
 the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft
 bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The warmth of
 her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea
 she poured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act
 of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who was the letter from? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bold hand. Marion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What are you singing?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>La ci darem</i> with J. C. Doyle, she said, and <i>Love's Old
 Sweet Song</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
 next day. Like foul flowerwater.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Would you like the window open a little?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What time is the funeral?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
 drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
 stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No: that book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Other stocking. Her petticoat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It must have fell down, she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He felt here and there. <i>Voglio e non vorrei</i>. Wonder if she
 pronounces that right: <i>voglio</i>. Not in the bed. Must have slid down.
 He stooped and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the
 bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to
 ask you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having
 wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with
 the hairpin till she reached the word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Met him what? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Here, she said. What does that mean?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Metempsychosis?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes. Who's he when he's at home?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That
 means the transmigration of souls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes. The
 first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over the smudged
 pages. <i>Ruby: the Pride of the Ring</i>. Hello. Illustration. Fierce
 Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.
 Sheet kindly lent. <i>The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim
 from him with an oath</i>. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze
 at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and
 we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they
 metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's soul
 after he dies. Dignam's soul...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did you finish it? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with
 the first fellow all the time?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Never read it. Do you want another?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to
 Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
 after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all
 lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.
 They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Bette remind
 her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The <i>Bath of the Nymph</i> over the bed. Given away with the Easter
 number of <i>Photo Bits</i>: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea
 before you put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three
 and six I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed.
 Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned the pages back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They
 used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
 instance. What they called nymphs, for example.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,
 inhaling through her arched nostrils.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the
 fire?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The kidney! he cried suddenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
 against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
 hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot
 up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork
 under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only a
 little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty
 brown gravy trickle over it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He
 shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful
 into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done
 to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one
 in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young
 student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it
 slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising
 it to his mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dearest Papli
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.
 Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy's Iovely box
 of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the
 photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs. Will send when
 developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to the
 heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to
 make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and
 thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be a concert in
 the Greville Arms on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some
 evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings
 Boylan's (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those
 seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now
 close with fondest love
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Your fond daughter, MILLY.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby. M.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday
 away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she was born,
 running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lot
 of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from the first
 poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once.
 He would be eleven now if he had lived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
 Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the XL
 Cafe about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look.
 Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
 piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do
 worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea
 to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has
 happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild piece
 of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vain: very.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her
 in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little. Was
 given milk too long. On the ERIN'S KING that day round the Kish. Damned
 old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the
 wind with her hair. <i>All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply
 swirls.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets, jarvey
 off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says. Pier with
 lamps, summer evening, band,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Those girls, those girls,
 Those lovely seaside girls.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
 Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
 braiding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
 yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen
 too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips
 kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass the
 time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and six
 return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M'Coy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
 nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants
 to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has the
 fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her
 back to the fire too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
 undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
 landing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as
 I'm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the tabledrawer he found an old number of <i>Titbits</i>. He folded it
 under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft
 bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Listening, he heard her voice:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come, come, pussy. Come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards
 the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid
 was in the garden. Fine morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Make
 a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure the
 whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like
 that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The hens
 in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of
 all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.
 Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes
 too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce.
 Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks. That
 bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the
 peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand
 too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago's
 shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown
 brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder
 have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there
 got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.
 Enthusiast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get
 these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under
 the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash
 and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered
 through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his
 countinghouse. Nobody.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on
 his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit.
 Our prize titbit: <i>Matcham's Masterstroke</i>. Written by Mr Philip
 Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a
 column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three.
 Three pounds, thirteen and six.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but
 resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he
 allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still
 patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not
 too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid
 of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it
 was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read
 on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. <i>Matcham
 often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who
 now</i>. Begins and ends morally. <i>Hand in hand</i>. Smart. He glanced
 back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly,
 he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of
 three pounds, thirteen and six.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for some
 proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said
 dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting her
 nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5. Did
 Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed
 me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust
 on the patent leather of her boot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning
 after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the
 hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
 night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
 dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
 Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
 humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
 mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest
 against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It
 wouldn't pan out somehow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers
 and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.
 Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then
 he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the
 jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
 black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is
 the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's church.
 They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Heigho! Heigho!
 Heigho! Heigho!
 Heigho! Heigho!</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poor Dignam!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
 Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.
 Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned
 from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. By
 Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked,
 smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her
 forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if
 he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of roses.
 Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da. Slack hour:
 won't be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face
 of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols' the
 undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged
 the job for O'Neill's. Singing with his eyes shut. Corny. Met her once in
 the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout. Her name and address she
 then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury
 him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom,
 tooraloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
 Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
 finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
 Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read
 blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his
 right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.
 Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather
 headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down
 into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the
 headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.
 Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made
 of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must be: the
 garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery
 meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like that. Those
 Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in <i>dolce far niente</i>, not doing
 a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel.
 Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air feeds
 most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies.
 Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on roseleaves.
 Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that
 picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a
 book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt.
 Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water
 is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the
 weight? It's a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his
 fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What
 is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per
 second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They all fall to the
 ground. The earth. It's the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
 sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i>
 from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and
 tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air:
 just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second it
 means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the
 postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He handed the card through the brass grill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are there any letters for me? he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
 poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton
 against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably.
 Went too far last time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.
 He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row, City.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing
 again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment? Castoff
 soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a grenadier.
 Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy.
 That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and
 drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell street at
 night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on the same tack
 now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover
 empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time.
 Table: able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see him dressed up as a
 fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
 that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
 felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
 Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the
 letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
 pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when
 you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How's the body?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Fine. How are you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only
 heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of
 the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood
 still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his
 pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a
 day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her
 hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo
 match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and
 handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is
 an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch out of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what
 do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
 Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his
 vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided
 drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.
 Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?</i>
 I said. <i>Poor little Paddy Dignam</i>, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
 dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?
 Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two
 strings to her bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Why?</i> I said. <i>What's wrong with him?</i> I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Proud: rich: silk stockings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a
 minute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>What's wrong with him</i>? He said. <i>He's dead</i>, he said.
 And, faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam</i>? I said. I couldn't
 believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or
 Thursday was it in the Arch. <i>Yes,</i> he said. <i>He's gone. He died on
 Monday, poor fellow</i>. Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.
 Watch!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and
 the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace
 street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the
 display of <i>esprit de corps</i>. Well, what are you gaping at?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?One of the best, M'Coy said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
 gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat
 in the sun: flicker, flick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? Incomplete With it an
 abode of bliss.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled
 yet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in
 the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it
 up?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.
 No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady
 and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Love's
 Old
 Sweet
 Song
 Comes lo-ove's old...</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 ?It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
 <i>Sweeeet song</i>. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part
 profits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, well, he said. That's good news.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He moved to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking
 around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the
 funeral, will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's
 a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
 would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if
 I'm not there, will you?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all
 right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly
 could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd like
 my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners,
 rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the
 Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that
 good day to this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just
 got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way:
 for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know: in the
 same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't he hear the
 difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow.
 Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there
 doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated again.
 Your wife and my wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Wonder is he pimping after me?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
 hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's Summer
 Sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. <i>Leah</i> tonight. Mrs Bandmann
 Palmer. Like to see her again in that. <i>Hamlet</i> she played last
 night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed
 suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside
 the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I
 was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the
 right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was
 always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and
 puts his fingers on his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his
 father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
 father and left the God of his father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every word is so deep, Leopold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his
 face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.
 No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met that M'Coy
 fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
 teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet
 oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they
 know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too
 full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded
 too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.
 Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. Still
 their neigh can be very irritating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
 carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies. All
 weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. <i>Voglio e
 non</i>. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying
 syllables as they pass. He hummed:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>La ci darem la mano
 La la lala la la.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the
 lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins
 and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with
 its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted
 child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby,
 a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them.
 Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it. And once
 I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. She liked
 mignonette. Mrs Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter within the
 newspaper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not
 annoyed then? What does she say?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dear Henry
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
 you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am
 awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
 you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
 what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you
 poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please
 tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you
 have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no
 idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so
 bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you
 do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you
 naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do
 not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you
 all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and
 write <i>by return</i> to your longing
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martha
 </p><br>
 <p>
 P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and
 placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it because
 no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then walking
 slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.
 Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don't
 please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon
 anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. Having read it
 all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she
 wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,
 respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you:
 not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as a
 row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next
 time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. Brutal, why not?
 Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common
 pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned
 together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without
 thorns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the
 Coombe, linked together in the rain.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.
 She didn't know what to do
 To keep it up
 To keep it up.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all day
 typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife use.
 Now could you make out a thing like that?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>To keep it up.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
 faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also
 the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>To keep it up.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
 quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,
 strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:
 fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in
 the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the
 trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and
 more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in
 shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away,
 sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same
 way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for
 a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out of
 porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four
 times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds, wait
 a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of
 porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and four into
 twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of
 porter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
 Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The
 bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,
 winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of
 liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch
 he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again
 behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for
 a pass to Mullingar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J. on
 saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the
 conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The
 protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true
 religion. Save China's millions. Wonder how they explain it to the heathen
 Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Buddha
 their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under
 his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and
 cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin
 Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I didn't work him about
 getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a
 fool but wasn't. They're taught that. He's not going out in bluey specs
 with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would
 take their fancy, flashing. Like to see them sitting round in a ring with
 blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I
 suppose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed
 the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to
 be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music.
 That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches
 with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the
 altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in
 his hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two
 (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and
 head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then the next one: a
 small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring
 all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth.
 What? <i>Corpus:</i> body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them
 first. Hospice for the dying. They don't seem to chew it: only swallow it
 down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one,
 and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its
 corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We
 ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and
 there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to
 melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of
 bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel
 happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big
 idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First
 communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party,
 same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not
 so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off
 steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of
 oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep
 near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms
 of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
 instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
 affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what to
 do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly
 told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it
 is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with a
 veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here with
 a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.
 Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the
 invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
 every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am
 thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children at
 home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers, now
 that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking about
 them. They're not straight men of business either. O, no, she's not here:
 the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope? Yes: under
 the bridge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
 smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
 what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage
 Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale
 (aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold
 comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old booser
 worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the whole
 atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.
 Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that
 instrument talk, the <i>vibrato</i>: fifty pounds a year they say he had
 in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i>
 of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate?
 Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill
 stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that
 corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking
 up:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>Quis est homo.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
 Mozart's twelfth mass: <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes keen on
 music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for
 example too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too,
 chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green
 Chartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit
 thick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own
 strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after.
 Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall,
 long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
 bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom
 glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up
 at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he
 sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar,
 holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other
 in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O God, our refuge and our strength...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them the
 bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious and
 immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting if
 you understood what it was all about. Wonderful organisation certainly,
 goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you
 all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More than
 doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And did you
 chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an excuse.
 Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God's
 little joke. Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray
 at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting.
 Hide her blushes. Salvation army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute
 will address the meeting. How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those
 must be in Rome: they work the whole show. And don't they rake in the
 money too? Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute
 discretion. Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open
 doors. Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in
 the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.
 Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the
 church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The priest prayed:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be
 our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
 restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
 host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
 other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
 remained behind: thanksgiving.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate perhaps.
 Pay your Easter duty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
 time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a
 (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.
 Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me before.
 Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south. He passed,
 discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into
 the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while
 before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide
 of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.
 Notice because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself. How goes the
 time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion made up. Where
 is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely
 move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long's,
 founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit
 some day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other
 trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair. O
 well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up last?
 Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must have
 been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems
 to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The
 alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?
 Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character. Living
 all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster
 lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost
 cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack. He ought to physic
 himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb
 to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough
 stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red.
 Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres.
 Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons
 the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever of nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?About a fortnight ago, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
 dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling your
 aches and pains.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
 orangeflower water...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And white wax also, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her
 eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.
 Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth:
 nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood.
 One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin.
 Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.
 But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? <i>Peau d'Espagne</i>.
 That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure
 curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage.
 Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I
 think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water.
 Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then
 all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought
 a bottle?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day
 and I'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Fourpence, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
 come back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
 coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a
 minute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
 younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a wash
 too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears' soap?
 Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
 Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
 Barber's itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the
 paper and get shut of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum
 the second.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What's that? his sharp voice said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it
 away that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets
 back on Mr Bloom's arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in
 it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it
 lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large
 tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming
 embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. They
 never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
 mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He eyed
 the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up
 like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like a
 wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.
 Something to catch the eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:
 might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How
 do you do, sir?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.
 Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it here.
 Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare
 street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line.
 And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor. Heatwave.
 Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of
 life we trace is dearer than them all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
 stream. This is my body.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
 warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and
 limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:
 his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush
 floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands,
 a languid floating flower.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
 carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after
 him, curving his height with care.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come on, Simon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?After you, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yes, yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after
 him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the
 armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered
 blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose
 whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over.
 Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we
 give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in
 corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting it
 ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more
 to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash
 and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an
 envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
 sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift
 it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
 then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
 swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the
 avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At
 walking pace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
 passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels
 rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
 rattling in the doorframes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
 out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.
 Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past
 Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a
 wide hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who is that?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Your son and heir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
 before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to
 the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell
 back, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <i>fidus Achates</i>!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
 faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of
 dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks:
 Dodder bridge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the
 firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in
 Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's
 two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to
 tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back.
 Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six
 hundred per cent profit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is
 a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
 all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make
 it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his
 aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I'll
 tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's
 son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild
 face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
 selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
 little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
 Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
 feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning
 in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by
 the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had
 that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,
 Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I
 could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn
 German too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are we late? Mr Power asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
 Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a
 woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
 Life, life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him.
 Do you follow me?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs
 from under his thighs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr
 Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
 leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and
 said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
 clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak
 of his beard gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage halted short.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What's wrong?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We're stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Where are we?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The grand canal, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it.
 Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
 really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
 tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss
 this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
 Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A
 dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs
 usually are.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
 spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I
 thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The weather is changing, he said quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming
 out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
 mute curse at the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We're off again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.
 Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard
 taking him off to his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear
 him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing of that
 simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
 whole course of my experience.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the
 retrospective arrangement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?In the paper this morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
 for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
 deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
 Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,
 Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
 Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of
 his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On
 whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky
 While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on
 high.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in
 the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled.
 Before my patience are exhausted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
 Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
 with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
 hats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway
 standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic so
 that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his
 job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new
 invention?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape
 armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge,
 past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs
 Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or
 the <i>Lily of Killarney</i>? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful
 change. Wet bright bills for next week. <i>Fun on the Bristol</i>. Martin
 Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two.
 As broad as it's long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow
 in salute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just that moment I was thinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white
 disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
 hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
 Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
 feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just
 looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit
 softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose
 the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the
 shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of
 the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
 glance over their faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power asked:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a
 good idea, you see...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Are you going yourself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
 county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
 chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Have you good artists?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all
 topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
 them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.
 Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
 Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth
 opening: oot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Four bootlaces for a penny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
 Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has
 that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible
 comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on
 his last legs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And <i>Madame</i>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.
 Doing her hair, humming. <i>voglio e non vorrei</i>. No. <i>vorrei e non</i>.
 Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un
 poco il</i>. Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A
 thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over the
 ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only
 politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he
 keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there
 is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.
 Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.
 What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of
 Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The devil break the hasp of your back!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
 carriage passed Gray's statue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, nearly all of us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J
 and the son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes. Isn't it awfully good?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
 send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he
 tried to drown...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
 their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
 loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and
 fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
 father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
 saving his son's life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver
 florin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nelson's pillar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a
 laugh. Many a good one he told himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
 fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
 he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's
 gone from us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
 very suddenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tapped his chest sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink
 like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The best death, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their wide open eyes looked at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in
 sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No-one spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,
 temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's,
 catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At
 night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father
 Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
 galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach.
 Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body,
 weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays.
 Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing.
 Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the
 man. Better luck next time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
 bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
 life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.
 We must take a charitable view of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's large
 eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like
 Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that
 here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake
 of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken already.
 Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching
 rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting
 up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him
 every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart
 out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel.
 Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in
 there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>And they call me the jewel of Asia,
 Of Asia,
 The Geisha.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
 room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through
 the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy.
 Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow
 streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict:
 overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race
 tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over
 and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here
 seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from <i>Saul.</i> He's as bad
 as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The <i>Mater
 Misericordiae</i>. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for
 incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying.
 Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible
 the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the
 screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed
 that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they
 told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage galloped round a
 corner: stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What's wrong now?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by
 on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.
 Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Emigrants, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their
 flanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Huuuh! out of that!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
 about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old
 England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost:
 all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year.
 Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap,
 margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train
 at Clonsilla.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage moved on through the drove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from
 the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
 in trucks down to the boats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.
 Quite right. They ought to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
 municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
 out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and
 all. Don't you see what I mean?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and
 saloon diningroom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more
 decent than galloping two abreast?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
 the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse
 fell about the road. Terrible!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
 shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for
 him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now. Quite
 right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly.
 Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The
 sphincter loose. Seal up all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause
 by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on
 the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of
 life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the
 knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on where. The
 circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be
 better to bury them in red: a dark red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by,
 coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping
 barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered
 horse. Aboard of the <i>Bugabu.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
 raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds,
 over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
 Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle
 down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the
 auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to row me
 o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out.
 Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as
 a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With
 turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat,
 saluting Paddy Dignam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of land
 silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in
 grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing.
 The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
 grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning
 boot. After life's journey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power pointed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him
 off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of
 the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
 person to be wrongfully condemned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,
 unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.
 The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about
 it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met
 her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
 Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without
 letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their
 pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare
 white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees,
 white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on
 the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
 out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his
 knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
 and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He
 stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still
 held.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same. Pallbearers,
 gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind
 carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes
 those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them?
 Mourners coming out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
 walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out
 the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging
 through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite
 block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
 with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on
 a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every
 day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for
 the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.
 Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour.
 Too many in the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
 hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt
 and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.
 Fish's face, bloodless and livid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much
 dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the
 stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed
 with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All walked after.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham whispered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
 Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
 Anniversary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
 towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
 mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How many children did he leave?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into
 Todd's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Has the laugh at him now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived
 him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the
 other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole
 with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu
 widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after.
 Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage.
 Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a
 few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow.
 Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope
 for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must
 go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.
 Haven't seen you for a month of Sundays.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned
 Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And how is Dick, the solid man?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy
 bald?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert
 said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
 insurance is cleared up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in
 front?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton
 is behind. He put down his name for a quid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he
 ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind
 the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
 slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
 when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and
 recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings
 to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the
 chapel. Which end is his head?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.
 The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at
 its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at
 each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here
 and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when
 all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket
 and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his
 left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
 door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
 hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly.
 Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with
 a fluent croak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. <i>Domine-namine.</i>
 Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
 betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
 sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him
 like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst
 sideways.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.
 Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly
 place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the
 gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.
 What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the
 place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas
 round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who
 was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's
 lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins
 sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One
 whiff of that and you're a goner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
 bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and
 shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you
 were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
 better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
 ...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up
 with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What
 harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh
 batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men
 with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little
 sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them
 all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?In paradisum.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.
 Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
 Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
 coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher
 gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed
 them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last
 folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground
 till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the
 gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
 trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But
 his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,
 Simon!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be
 stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in
 his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?She's better where she is, he said kindly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
 heaven if there is a heaven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
 plod by.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we
 can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They covered their heads.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you
 think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,
 secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the
 last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Kernan added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler,
 more impressive I must say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>I am the resurrection and the life</i>. That touches a man's
 inmost heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It does, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with
 his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken
 heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.
 One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying
 around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.
 The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last
 day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus!
 And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow
 mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.
 Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull.
 Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Everything went off A1, he said. What?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With your
 tooraloom tooraloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Kernan assured him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
 know his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert glanced back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
 soprano. She's his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some
 time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
 seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good
 armful she was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked behind through the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery
 line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for
 blottingpaper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon
 like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
 grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am come to pay you another visit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want
 your custom at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
 Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the
 Coombe?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
 caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in
 a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one
 foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
 Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing
 about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt
 out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue
 of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, <i>Not a bloody bit
 like the man</i>, says he. <i>That's not Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever
 done it</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
 the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to
 Hynes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I know, Hynes said. I know that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure
 goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good
 terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys: like
 Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. <i>Habeas
 corpus</i>. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write
 Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing
 to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better
 of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when the hairs
 come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey.
 Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.
 Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might
 thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering here with all
 the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn
 and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to
 say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant
 in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it
 to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story
 in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was
 a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd
 kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn
 anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like
 that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of
 death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell
 of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to
 grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has
 anyway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
 after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting
 or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above
 ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground
 must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and
 edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought
 to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing
 produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just
 over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea
 those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well
 preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A
 bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately
 deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
 nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
 quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy
 kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of
 them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are
 go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed
 on feed on themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
 swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
 seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
 power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.
 Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the
 bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing
 time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would
 like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy
 pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must
 laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in <i>Hamlet</i>.
 Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the
 dead for two years at least. <i>De mortuis nil nisi prius</i>. Go out of
 mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read
 your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind.
 New lease of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
 trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
 with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
 nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't
 know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there
 in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to
 know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow
 could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to
 get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We
 all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury
 the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried
 him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
 How could you possibly do so?</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them
 all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a
 handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but
 they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. They're so
 particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land.
 Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what
 it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The
 Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same
 idea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
 Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's
 number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that
 I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one
 like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once.
 Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine
 turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not married or
 his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
 gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pause.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If we were all suddenly somebody else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
 say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy
 by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the
 black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.
 Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.
 Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be
 damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone
 else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then
 darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you
 like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid
 all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his
 lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the
 soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the
 floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing
 him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of <i>Lucia.
 Shall i nevermore behold thee</i>? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People
 talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember
 him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:
 dropping into a hole, one after the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and not
 in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of
 purgatory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when
 you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near
 you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor
 mamma, and little Rudy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on
 the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all the
 time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.
 Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to
 pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the
 coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days.
 Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as
 soon as you are sure there's no.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it.
 The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without
 show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way
 deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he
 traversed the dismal fields.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows
 them all. No: coming to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is
 your christian name? I'm not sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too.
 He asked me to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the <i>Freeman</i>
 once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea
 a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of
 a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley,
 you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I
 saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an
 obligation: costs nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
 over there in the...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that
 his name?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He moved away, looking about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
 the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
 Lord, what became of him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, excuse me!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stepped aside nimbly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A
 mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their
 spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath
 against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put
 on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then
 knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the
 haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with
 shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead
 another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning
 away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir:
 trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at
 whiles to read a name on a tomb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Let us, Mr Power said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
 Power's blank voice spoke:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
 with stones. That one day he will come again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hynes shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was
 mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
 broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old
 Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
 charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
 really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump
 them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be at his
 grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man
 himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's door. Who
 passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own
 accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More
 interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I
 travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's
 with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country
 churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas
 Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The
 great physician called him home. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice
 country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet
 smoke and read the <i>Church Times.</i> Marriage ads they never try to
 beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better
 value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other
 gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
 wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
 Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.
 Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a
 daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
 sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
 dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
 infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of
 fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.
 Apollo that was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As
 you are now so once were we.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
 voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the
 house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
 Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
 hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph
 reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after
 fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died
 when I was in Wisdom Hely's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
 goes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.
 An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive
 crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good
 hidingplace for treasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
 buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tail gone now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean
 no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad.
 Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that <i>Voyages in China</i>
 that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better.
 Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners
 and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat
 them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee
 tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is
 the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to
 life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder
 does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground
 communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular
 square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of
 Dignam. They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush
 of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough
 of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here
 was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even
 scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to
 get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.
 Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You
 will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There
 is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world
 she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live
 warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not
 going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
 commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
 Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,
 the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out
 that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
 of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first
 sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow
 always like that, mortified if women are by.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton
 took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on
 his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thank you, he said shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few
 paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind
 a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get
 the pull over him that way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before Nelson's pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for
 Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
 Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend
 and Sandymount Tower, Harold's Cross. The hoarse Dublin United Tramway
 Company's timekeeper bawled them off:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Rathgar and Terenure!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come on, Sandymount Green!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck
 moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Start, Palmerston Park!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.
 Parked in North Prince's street His Majesty's vermilion mailcars, bearing
 on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received loudly flung sacks of
 letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local,
 provincial, British and overseas delivery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores and
 bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped
 dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's stores.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I'll take it round to
 the <i>Telegraph</i> office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in a
 large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a
 roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red Murray's long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper
 in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
 square.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen
 behind his ear, we can do him one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I'll rub that in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Brayden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
 stately figure entered between the newsboards of the <i>Weekly Freeman and
 National Press</i> and the <i>Freeman's Journal and National Press</i>.
 Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,
 steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back
 ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
 Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck, fat,
 neck, fat, neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build one
 door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.
 Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
 Saviour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his heart.
 In <i>Martha.</i>
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>Co-ome thou lost one,
 Co-ome thou dear one!</i>

 <p>
 THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
 stepped off posthaste with a word:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?Freeman!</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom said slowly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, he is one of our saviours also.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in
 through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the
 now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation? Thumping.
 Thumping.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing
 paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti's
 reading closet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST
 RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This
 morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man
 to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries are
 pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away,
 tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for
 College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.
 It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the
 official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year
 one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of
 Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute
 showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina.
 Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle
 Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's queries. Dear Mr Editor, what
 is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like that part. Learn a lot teaching
 others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers
 on golden strand. World's biggest balloon. Double marriage of sisters
 celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too,
 printer. More Irish than the Irish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he got
 paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on and on
 the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the whole
 thing. Want a cool head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet
 and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the
 dirty glass screen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom stood in his way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
 pointing backward with his thumb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Did you? Hynes asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hurried on eagerly towards the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you
 remember?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He
 wants two keys at the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe
 he understands what I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to
 scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let him take that in first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
 foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
 obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of
 it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various
 uses, thousand and one things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly
 on the scarred woodwork.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the
 name. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Better not teach him his own business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the
 top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good
 idea?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
 there quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know,
 councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you
 know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i>voglio.</i> But
 then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a
 house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and
 just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass
 licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman thought for an instant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.
 Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent
 typesetters at their cases.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ORTHOGRAPHICAL
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot to
 give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view the
 unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a harassed
 pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a
 cemetery wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course on account of
 the symmetry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to
 have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have said.
 Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard
 with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the
 way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door
 too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way.
 Sllt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the
 <i>Telegraph.</i> Where's what's his name?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ay. Where's Monks?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Monks!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it
 a good place I know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Monks!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it
 anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists
 over for the show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A DAYFATHER
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,
 aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put
 through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches,
 divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober
 serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say. Wife a good cook and
 washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn
 nonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
 Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice
 that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards
 with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All
 that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into
 the house of bondage <i>Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu</i>. No,
 that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then the
 lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.
 And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the
 dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.
 Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life
 is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems
 to see with his fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
 the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him
 out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron's
 house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those
 walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell
 there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door when I
 was there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I
 put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he
 took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his
 trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something I
 forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A sudden screech of laughter came from the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>
 office. Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert
 it is.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He entered softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
 the dusty windowpane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing
 face, asked of it sourly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it
 babbles on its way, tho' quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the
 tumbling waters of Neptune's blue domain, 'mid mossy banks, fanned by
 gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows
 cast o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of
 the forest</i>. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his
 newspaper. How's that for high?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage</i>. O boys! O
 boys!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again
 on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want
 to hear any more of the stuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
 hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
 Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old
 Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.
 Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death written this long time
 perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself. Johnny, make room
 for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he
 writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when he kicks
 out. Alleluia.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh
 answered with pomp of tone. <i>Our lovely land</i>. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With
 an accent on the whose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert nodded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?But listen to this, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed
 in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Excuse me, J. J. O'Molloy said, entering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I beg yours, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day, Jack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come in. Come in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How are you, Dedalus?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well. And yourself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 SAD
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap. That
 hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What's in the
 wind, I wonder. Money worry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You're looking extra.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the
 inner door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He's in
 his sanctum with Lenehan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
 pink pages of the file.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of
 honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.
 Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve
 like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the
 <i>Express</i> with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began
 on the <i>Independent.</i> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about
 when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the
 same breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till you hear
 the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows
 over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ah, listen to this for God' sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. <i>Or again
 if we but climb the serried mountain peaks...</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated
 windbag!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Peaks</i>, Ned Lambert went on, <i>towering high on high, to
 bathe our souls, as it were...</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is
 he taking anything for it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio,
 unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
 regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious
 pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow
 of our mild mysterious Irish twilight...</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 HIS NATIVE DORIC
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing
 orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence...</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and
 onions! That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache,
 welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant
 after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's unshaven
 blackspectacled face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Doughy Daw! he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 WHAT WETHERUP SAID
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
 cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they call
 him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that
 chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.
 Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get a
 grip of them by the stomach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by
 a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about
 them and the harsh voice asked:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What is it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
 grandly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in
 recognition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink
 after that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved
 towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.
 We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance
 at his toecaps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?In Ohio! the editor shouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Incipient jigs. Sad case.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet
 face. My Ohio!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 O, HARP EOLIAN!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off
 a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed
 teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bingbang, bangbang.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an
 ad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked,
 coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you
 fret. Hello, Jack. That's all right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held
 slip limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The telephone whirred inside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 SPOT THE WINNER
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.
 Madden up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tossed the tissues on to the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
 flung open.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by
 the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The
 tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls
 and under the table came to earth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a
 hurricane blowing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped
 twice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat
 Farrell shoved me, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Him, sir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Continued on page six, column four.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Yes, <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner
 office. Is the boss...? Yes, <i>Telegraph</i>... To where? Aha! Which
 auction rooms ?... Aha! I see... Right. I'll catch him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A COLLISION ENSUES
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped
 against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Pardon, monsieur</i>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant
 and making a grimace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a
 hurry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Knee, Lenehan said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The accumulation of the <i>anno Domini</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy slapped
 the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed
 in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>?We are the boys of Wexford
 Who fought with heart and hand.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 EXIT BLOOM
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about
 this ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in
 Dillon's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
 leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
 suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Begone! he said. The world is before you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them, blowing
 them apart gently, without comment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through
 his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps
 after him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A STREET CORTEGE
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
 Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
 tail of white bowknots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
 and you'll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
 walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet
 past the fireplace to J. J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his
 receiving hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What's that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other
 two gone?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who? the professor said, turning. They're gone round to the Oval
 for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where's my hat?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,
 jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and
 against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Seems to be, J. J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
 murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most
 matches?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE CALUMET OF PEACE
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
 promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.
 O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Thanky vous</i>, Lenehan said, helping himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
 declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>?'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, 'Twas empire charmed thy
 heart.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with
 quick grace, said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Silence for my brandnew riddle!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Imperium romanum</i>, J. J. O'Molloy said gently. It sounds
 nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the
 fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That's it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the
 fire. We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We
 mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,
 imperial, imperious, imperative.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae:
 sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i>It is
 meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</i>. The Roman, like the
 Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
 which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
 obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be
 here. Let us construct a watercloset.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient
 ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to
 the running stream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They were nature's gentlemen, J. J. O'Molloy murmured. But we have
 also Roman law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O'Molloy
 asked. It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going
 swimmingly ...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the
 hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>Entrez, mes enfants!</i> Lenehan cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led
 by Experience visits Notoriety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your
 governor is just gone.???
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan said to all:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,
 excogitate, reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Who? the editor asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bit torn off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>On swift sail flaming
 From storm and south
 He comes, pale vampire,
 Mouth to my mouth.</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 ?Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
 shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bullockbefriending bard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine.
 Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The
 bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
 disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter's face
 in the Star and Garter. Oho!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of
 Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O'Rourke, prince of Breffni.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
 typescript. Emperor's horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on the
 ramparts of Vienna. Don't you forget! Maximilian Karl O'Donnell, graf von
 Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian
 fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes,
 every time. Don't you forget that!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O'Molloy said quietly,
 turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Professor MacHugh turned on him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And if not? he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was
 one day... LOST CAUSES
 </p><br>
 <p>
 NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success
 for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never
 loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
 language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the
 maxim: time is money. Material domination. <i>Dominus!</i> Lord! Where is
 the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club.
 But the Greek!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 KYRIE ELEISON!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The Greek! he said again. <i>Kyrios!</i> Shining word! The vowels
 the Semite and the Saxon know not. <i>Kyrie!</i> The radiance of the
 intellect. I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. <i>Kyrie
 eleison!</i> The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of
 our spirit. We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that
 foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an <i>imperium,</i>
 that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They
 went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve
 the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He strode away from them towards the window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they
 always fell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received
 in the latter half of the <i>matin?e</i>. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He whispered then near Stephen's ear:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 LENEHAN'S LIMERICK
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> <i>There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh
 Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
 As he mostly sees double
 To wear them why trouble?
 I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?</i>
</pre>
 <p>
 In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll be
 all right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan extended his hands in protest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Opera? Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan announced gladly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>The Rose of Castile</i>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel.
 Gee!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O'Madden Burke fell
 back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
 tissues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
 Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O'Molloy said in
 quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between
 you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 OMNIUM GATHERUM
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The turf, Lenehan put in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Literature, the press.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of
 advertisement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin's
 prime favourite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan gave a loud cough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
 cold in the park. The gate was open.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 YOU CAN DO IT!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a
 bite in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. <i>In the lexicon of
 youth</i> ...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.
 Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the
 public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn
 its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O'Molloy said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 THE GREAT GALLAHER
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
 emphasis. Wait a minute. We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used
 to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
 Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know
 how he made his mark? I'll tell you. That was the smartest piece of
 journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the
 invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.
 I'll show you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pushed past them to the files.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Look at here, he said turning. The <i>New York World</i> cabled for
 a special. Remember that time?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Professor MacHugh nodded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?<i>New York World</i>, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his
 straw hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady
 and the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that
 cabman's shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.
 You know Holohan?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones
 for the corporation. A night watchman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen turned in surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Gumley? he said. You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind
 the stones, see they don't run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius
 Gallaher do? I'll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have
 you <i>Weekly Freeman</i> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say.
 Have you got that? Right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The telephone whirred.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A DISTANT VOICE
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I'll answer it, the professor said, going.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?B is parkgate. Good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is
 Knockmaroon gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. An illstarched
 dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
 waistcoat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hello? <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here... Hello?... Who's there?...
 Yes... Yes... Yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
 Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.
 Got that? X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The professor came to the inner door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy's
 publichouse, see? CLEVER, VERY
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole
 bloody history.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nightmare from which you will never awake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the
 besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
 myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was
 there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of an
 advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the leg
 up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <i>Star.</i>
 Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. That's press. That's talent. Pyatt! He
 was all their daddies!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
 brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across
 yourself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.
 He flung the pages down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some
 hawkers were up before the recorder?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?O yes, J. J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home
 through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone
 last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be
 a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.
 Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!

 <p>
 ?They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
 Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
 fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan. Eh?
 Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you
 write it then?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 RHYMES AND REASONS
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be
 some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,
 looking the same, two by two.

 He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
 russet, entwining, <i>per l'aer perso</i>, in mauve, in purple, <i>quella
 pacifica oriafiamma</i>, gold of oriflamme, <i>di rimirar fe piu ardenti.</i>
 But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
 south: tomb womb.

 <p>
 ?Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a
 false construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised,
 for the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running
 away with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes
 and Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,
 Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery
 guttersheet not to mention <i>Paddy Kelly's Budget, Pue's Occurrences</i>
 and our watchful friend <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i>. Why bring in a master
 of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the
 newspaper thereof. LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in
 his face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.
 Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Well, J. J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of
 it in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only
 for ... But no matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my
 life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of
 fratricide, the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him. <i>And in the
 porches of mine ear did pour.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other
 story, beast with two backs?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?What was that? the professor asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O'Molloy said, of Roman
 justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the <i>lex talionis</i>.
 And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Ha.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pause. J. J. O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 False lull. Something quite ordinary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it
 was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that
 determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. A POLISHED PERIOD
 </p><br>
 <p>
 J. J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He said of it: <i>that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
 terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of
 prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has
 wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to
 live, deserves to live.</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You like it? J. J. O'Molloy asked Stephen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He
 took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O'Molloy offered his case to Myles
 Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,
 saying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Muchibus thankibus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy
 said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
 hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She
 was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee
 interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask
 him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been
 pulling A. E.'s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about
 me? Don't ask.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
 Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever
 heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
 society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
 spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
 advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his
 discourse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it,
 on the Trinity college estates commission.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's
 frock. Go on. Well?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ?It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished
 orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I
 will n
