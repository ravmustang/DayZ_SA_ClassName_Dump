 FATHER GORIOT
 </h2>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer (<i>nee</i> de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the
 past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue
 Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the Latin
 Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in the
 neighborhood as the <i>Maison Vauquer</i>) receives men and women, old and
 young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable
 establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of
 fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years, and that if
 a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his
 allowance must be of the slenderest. In 1819, however, the time when this
 drama opens, there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer's
 boarders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been
 overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous
 literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is
 dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may
 perhaps be shed <i>intra et extra muros</i> before it is over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to
 doubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close
 observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color,
 are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of
 crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which
 are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so accustomed to
 terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible
 woe could produce any lasting impression there. Now and again there are
 tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues
 and vices that bring them about, that egotism and selfishness are forced
 to pause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is
 like a luscious fruit, soon consumed. Civilization, like the car of
 Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less
 easy to break than the others that lie in its course; this also is broken,
 and Civilization continues on her course triumphant. And you, too, will do
 the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among
 the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, "Perhaps this may
 amuse me." You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes, and,
 dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your
 insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing
 romances. Ah! once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance!
 <i>All is true</i>,?so true, that every one can discern the elements
 of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer's own property. It is still standing in
 the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road
 slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l'Arbalete, that wheeled traffic
 seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This position is
 sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in
 between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace, two
 conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape
 and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their
 leaden-hued cupolas.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor
 water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The most
 heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the
 sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the
 houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. A Parisian
 straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public
 institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die,
 and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of
 Paris, and, it may be added, the least known. But, before all things, the
 Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which
 the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and
 sober images. Even so, step by step the daylight decreases, and the
 cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the
 Catacombs. The comparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly,
 the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks
 out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house in
 section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. Beneath the wall
 of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with
 cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums
 and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed
 earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door,
 above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather
 smaller letters, "<i>Lodgings for both sexes, etc.</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a
 wicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the further
 end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon a time
 by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing
 Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he
 looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals, and might
 suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The half-obliterated
 inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of
 art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire
 on his return to Paris in 1777:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Whoe'er thou art, thy master see;
 He is, or was, or ought to be."
</pre>
 <p>
 At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden is
 no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall of
 the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A mantle of
 ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect
 which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered with
 trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and furnish
 besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her lodgers; every
 year the widow trembles for her vintage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a
 clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; <i>line</i>-trees, as Mme.
 Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de
 Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of
 pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and
 parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats
 and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers
 as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their
 pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under
 the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the yellowish
 stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris. There
 are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds
 visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry, so that the
 lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house there are but
 two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy
 iron grating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by
 a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on
 the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen
 window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges
 its greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little
 door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard
 with copious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access is
 given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor, a
 sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred
 windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the
 dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the
 staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles,
 which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than the
 sight of that sitting-room. The furniture is covered with horse hair woven
 in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a round table in the
 middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which there stands, by way of
 ornament, the inevitable white china tea-service, covered with a
 half-effaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently uneven, the wainscot
 rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a
 varnished paper, on which the principal scenes from <i>Telemaque</i> are
 depicted, the various classical personages being colored. The subject
 between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of
 Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has
 furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves
 superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty
 condemns them. The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident
 that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions; the stone
 chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial
 flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble
 clock in the very worst taste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language,
 and which should be called the <i>odeur de pension</i>. The damp
 atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy,
 musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents
 seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the
 reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe it if some one should
 discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the
 nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations
 of every individual lodger, young or old. Yet, in spite of these stale
 horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a
 boudoir, when compared with the adjoining dining-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now a
 matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers
 of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A collection of
 dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen on them, and
 piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky
 surfaces of the sideboards that line the room. In a corner stands a box
 containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which the lodgers' table
 napkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine, are kept. Here you see
 that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere, which finds its
 way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into
 hospitals for incurables. You expect in such places as these to find the
 weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the
 execrable engravings which spoil your appetite, framed every one in a
 black varnished frame, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of
 tortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the Argand
 lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your eyes before. The oilcloth
 which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish <i>externe</i>
 will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a style. The
 chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen mats slip away
 from under your feet without slipping away for good; and finally, the
 foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about
 the holes. It would be impossible to give an idea of the old, rotten,
 shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed, one-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle
 condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description, which would
 delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would
 not pardon. The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought
 about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short, there is no
 illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire,
 parsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk
 into the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet,
 its clothing is ready to drop to pieces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This apartment is in all its glory at seven o'clock in the morning, when
 Mme. Vauquer's cat appears, announcing the near approach of his mistress,
 and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls, each
 protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. A
 moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked out in a net cap
 attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles into the room in her
 slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a bloated countenance, and
 a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it; her fat little hands
 (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her shapeless, slouching figure are
 in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune, where hope is reduced
 to speculate for the meanest stakes. Mme. Vauquer alone can breathe that
 tainted air without being disheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a
 frosty morning in autumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in
 their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark,
 suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once the
 embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as her
 lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no more
 imagine the one without the other, than you can think of a jail without a
 turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the
 life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a
 hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt
 made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding through the rents in the
 material, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room, and
 the little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the lodgers?the
 picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "have seen a deal
 of trouble." She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in
 flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher
 price for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a
 Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be
 betrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still,
 "she is a good woman at bottom," said the lodgers who believed that the
 widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her, and
 sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this head.
 How had she lost her money? "Through trouble," was her answer. He had
 treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his
 cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody,
 because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every
 possible misfortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps,
 hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the
 house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these <i>externes</i>
 usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven
 inmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme. Vauquer
 herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let to a Mme.
 Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic.
 With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom she filled the
 place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an
 old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer of a
 black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a retired merchant,
 and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on the third floor
 were also let?one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle. Michonneau, and
 the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli, Italian paste and
 starch, who allowed the others to address him as "Father Goriot." The
 remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage, to impecunious
 students, who like "Father Goriot" and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster
 forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging. Mme. Vauquer
 had little desire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and
 she only took them in default of better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man
 from the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who pinched and
 starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him.
 Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was his name, to
 work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that
 their parents' hopes are centered on them, and deliberately prepare
 themselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the first
 to this end, carefully watching the indications of the course of events,
 calculating the probable turn that affairs will take, that they may be the
 first to profit by them. But for his observant curiosity, and the skill
 with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this
 story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly
 owes to him, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and
 desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which
 was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to
 pass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry,
 and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in one, and
 Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven inmates thus
 enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical
 students dined in the house, as well as two or three regular comers who
 lived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen people at dinner,
 and there was room, if need be, for twenty at Mme. Vauquer's table; at
 breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like a
 family party. Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers, and the
 conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening
 before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were
 exchanged in friendly confidence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer's spoiled children. Among them she
 distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of respect
 and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board. One
 single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by
 chance. The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month.
 Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the
 district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere; and, as might be expected,
 poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being
 the sole exception to the rule.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of
 the house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men's coats were
 problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only to be
 seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at
 the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its
 former self. The women's dresses were faded, old-fashioned, dyed and
 re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended
 lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin fichus. So much for their clothing;
 but, for the most part, their frames were solid enough; their
 constitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces
 were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation, but there
 were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas brought to a close or
 still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these,
 not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a
 background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas
 that sere hearts like fire, dramas that do not end with the actors' lives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from the
 daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an object fit
 to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with its scanty,
 draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular was
 the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once. What
 corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was it trouble, or vice, or
 greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer,
 a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses, or had she been merely a
 courtesan? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded
 with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by?
 Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a
 menace. Her voice was like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper
 sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had
 nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by
 his children, who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a
 life annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his heirs,
 who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the ravages of
 conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its former fairness
 and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth
 still survived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like a
 gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a
 shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin
 fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal
 his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs; the
 thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man; there was
 a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and
 crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey
 gobbler's; altogether, his appearance set people wondering whether this
 outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who
 flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could
 have so shriveled him? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous
 countenance, which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? What had
 he been? Well, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a
 clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts,?so
 much for providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so
 much for pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver
 at the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances.
 Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our
 great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do
 not even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of
 misery and things unclean; one of those men, in short, at sight of whom we
 are prompted to remark that, "After all, we cannot do without them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or
 physical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can
 plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no matter how
 numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be
 lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers and
 pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of
 literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two, however, of Mme. Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the
 rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic girls,
 in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer's face; and her unvarying expression of
 sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in keeping with
 the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue
 Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this picture; but her
 face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her
 movements. This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub, newly planted in
 an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have already begun to wither. The
 outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest
 materials, were also youthful. There was the same kind of charm about her
 too slender form, her faintly colored face and light-brown hair, that
 modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look
 of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of
 contrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming. Happiness
 is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If the delightful
 excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color; if the
 delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that
 were slightly hollowed already; if love had put light into the sad eyes,
 then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest; but she lacked the two
 things which create woman a second time?pretty dresses and
 love-letters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that he
 had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed her a
 bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken measures to
 disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into
 personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son. Victorine's
 mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture's house; and the latter,
 who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan. Unluckily,
 the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had
 nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension, and some
 day she might be obliged to leave the helpless, inexperienced girl to the
 mercy of the world. The good soul, therefore, took Victorine to mass every
 Sunday, and to confession once a fortnight, thinking that, in any case,
 she would bring up her ward to be devout. She was right; religion offered
 a solution of the problem of the young girl's future. The poor child loved
 the father who refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to
 see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness, but every year
 hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was inexorable.
 Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come to see her for
 four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she prayed to God to
 unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart, and no
 accusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer
 exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find words that did
 justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct; but while they heaped
 execrations on the millionaire, Victorine's words were as gentle as the
 moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression even in the cry
 drawn from her by pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair
 complexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his whole
 bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family, or
 that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. If he was
 careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year's clothes into daily wear,
 still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion.
 Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black cravat,
 untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers that matched the rest of
 his costume, and boots that had been resoled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition
 stage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind of
 man that calls forth the remark: "He looks a jovial sort!" He had broad
 shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong square-fisted
 hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red
 hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there was a certain
 hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. His bass
 voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping with his boisterous
 laughter. He was always obliging, always in good spirits; if anything went
 wrong with one of the locks, he would soon unscrew it, take it to pieces,
 file it, oil and clean and set it in order, and put it back in its place
 again; "I am an old hand at it," he used to say. Not only so, he knew all
 about ships, the sea, France, foreign countries, men, business, law, great
 houses and prisons,?there was nothing that he did not know. If any
 one complained rather more than usual, he would offer his services at
 once. He had several times lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders;
 but, somehow, those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death
 than fail to repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his
 face, inspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. In
 the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to
 indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate
 himself from a false position. His eyes, like those of a pitiless judge,
 seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all
 feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was very regular; he usually went
 out after breakfast, returning in time for dinner, and disappeared for the
 rest of the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latch key, a
 privilege that Mme. Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was
 on very good terms with the widow; he used to call her "mamma," and put
 his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to
 the full! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as
 a matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a
 month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he took
 after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the
 whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything
 that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped short at the
 vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them. He knew or
 guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had been
 able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. He had
 deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his unfailing readiness to
 oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest
 of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character.
 He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the
 lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in
 mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some
 grudge against the social system rankled in him, as if there were some
 mystery carefully hidden away in his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength of
 the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances and
 secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them seemed to
 take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her
 position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that matter, there was
 not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various
 chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. Each
 one regarded the others with indifference, tempered by suspicion; it was a
 natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance not one
 could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted their
 stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances. They
 were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing
 left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in contact,
 but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of
 them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that
 felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in
 death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them
 cold to the most terrible anguish in others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who
 reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions.
 For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain, and drought
 combined to make as dreary as an Asian <i>steppe</i>, was a pleasant
 shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had
 charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells belonged to her. She fed
 those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority
 was recognized among them. Where else in Paris would they have found
 wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them, and
 rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or
 comfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? If she had committed some
 flagrant act of injustice, the victim would have borne it in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements out
 of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a school, as
 in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and women who met
 round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all the others,
 condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the beginning of Eugene de
 Rastignac's second twelvemonth, this figure suddenly started out into bold
 relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law
 student was yet to live for another two years to come. This laughing-stock
 was the retired vermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a
 painter, like the historian, would have concentrated all the light in his
 picture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant
 contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of
 persecution, in which there was mingled some pity, but no respect for his
 misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or
 absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious
 defects? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice.
 Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will
 endure suffering, whether by reason of its genuine humility, or
 indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not, one and all, like to feel
 our strength even at the expense of some one or of something? The poorest
 sample of humanity, the street arab, will pull the bell handle at every
 street door in bitter weather, and scramble up to write his name on the
 unsullied marble of a monument.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, "Father Goriot"
 had sold his business and retired?to Mme. Vauquer's boarding house.
 When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme.
 Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five
 louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer had made
 various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use, in
 consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the
 miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a
 few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet, several wretched
 colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a little suburban tavern
 would have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which
 Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life
 (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that gave Mme.
 Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked on him
 as an imbecile where money was concerned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous outfit
 of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme. Vauquer's
 astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts, the
 splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a
 large diamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which adorned
 the vermicelli-maker's shirt front. He usually wore a coat of corn-flower
 blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean
 white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad
 expanse. When his hostess accused him of being "a bit of a beau," he
 smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His
 cupboards (<i>ormoires</i>, as he called them in the popular dialect) were
 filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him. The widow's eyes
 gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles,
 table-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast services?all
 of silver, which were duly arranged upon shelves, besides a few more or
 less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no inconsiderable number of
 ounces; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded
 him of past domestic festivals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This was my wife's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding
 day," he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver posset dish,
 with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. "Poor dear! she spent on it
 all the money she had saved before we were married. Do you know, I would
 sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living, madame, than part
 with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning
 for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not to be pitied. There's
 not much fear of my starving for some time to come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, Mme. Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain
 entries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough
 calculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something
 like ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer (<i>nee</i>
 de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight summers,
 though she would only own to thirty-nine of them?Mme. Vauquer had
 her own ideas. Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their
 sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular
 affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she considered him
 to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. Moreover, the widow saw
 favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his
 legs and in his square-shaped nose, indications still further borne out by
 the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature.
 This, in all probability, was a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly
 consisted in a capacity for affection. His hair, worn in <i>ailes de
 pigeon</i>, and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole
 Polytechnique, described five points on his low forehead, and made an
 elegant setting to his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he
 was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way,
 like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with
 maccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M.
 Goriot's installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered
 before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and
 rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her boarding-house, give
 her hand to this fine flower of citizenship, become a lady of consequence
 in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes; she
 would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would
 have a box at the theatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the
 author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the
 whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer
 in her dreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand
 francs, accumulated <i>sou by sou</i>, that was her secret; surely as far
 as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match. "And in other
 respects, I am quite his equal," she said to herself, turning as if to
 assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found
 moulded in down feathers every morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the
 services of M. Goriot's coiffeur, and went to some expense over her
 toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself
 and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such
 highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence. She
 expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her
 lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but
 people who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself, she
 let him know that M. Goriot, one of the best known and most
 highly-respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her boarding-house
 for a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which
 it was asserted that hers was "<i>one of the oldest and most highly
 recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter</i>." "From the windows
 of the house," thus ran the prospectus, "there is a charming view of the
 Vallee des Gobelins (so there is?from the third floor), and a <i>beautiful</i>
 garden, <i>extending</i> down to <i>an avenue of lindens</i> at the
 further end." Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its
 quiet situation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil, a
 widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her
 husband's affairs, and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as
 the wife of a general who had died "on the field of battle." On this Mme.
 Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for
 nearly six months, and kept the promise of her prospectus, even going to
 some expense to do so. And the Countess, on her side, addressed Mme.
 Vauquer as "my dear," and promised her two more boarders, the Baronne de
 Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who
 were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were
 higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be
 very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of
 their formalities. "But Government departments are always so dilatory,"
 the lady added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer's room, and
 had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved
 for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were
 cordially approved by Mme. de l'Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion,
 which for that matter she had guessed from the very first; in her opinion
 the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my
 eyesight?a man who might make a woman happy!" said the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer's dress,
 which was not in harmony with her projects. "You must put yourself on a
 war footing," said she.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together?they
 purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais
 Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite
 Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped for the
 campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a
 sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she herself was so much pleased
 with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance, that she
 felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and, though by no
 means open-handed, she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty
 francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the
 delicate mission of sounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in
 his ears. Mme. de l'Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this
 manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private
 interview; but the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him
 for herself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She
 left him, revolted by his coarseness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My angel," said she to her dear friend, "you will make nothing of that
 man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an
 idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l'Ambermesnil, the
 Countess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next day,
 forgot to pay for six months' board, and left behind her wardrobe,
 cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently as
 Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil was
 never heard of again in Paris. The widow often talked of this deplorable
 business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As a matter of
 fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many other people,
 who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next
 chance comer?an odd but common phenomenon, whose causes may readily
 be traced to the depths of the human heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for
 from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of their
 hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are conscious
 that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be judged
 severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that
 they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess,
 in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which they have not, hoping
 to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting
 it again some day. Or, once more, there are other mercenary natures who
 never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a
 claim upon them, while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to
 self-love. Such natures feel but little affection for those who are
 nearest to them; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of
 acquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme.
 Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean, false, and execrable
 classes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I had been there at the time," Vautrin would say at the end of the
 story, "I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have
 befallen you. I know that kind of phiz!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to
 events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them
 about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on
 other people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker
 was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her eyes, so she said,
 with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in
 vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was
 not slow to discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain to
 her at once that there was <i>some other attraction</i>, to use her own
 expression. In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly
 cherished was a baseless delusion, and that she would "never make anything
 out of that man yonder," in the Countess' forcible phrase. The Countess
 seemed to have been a judge of character. Mme. Vauquer's aversion was
 naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her hatred was not in
 proportion to her love, but to her disappointed expectations. The human
 heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height
 of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred.
 Still, M. Goriot was a lodger, and the widow's wounded self-love could not
 vent itself in an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of
 his convent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to
 gulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for
 their feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of petty
 ingenuity. The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of
 covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment?various
 luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!" she
 said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of fare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the
 world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup, boiled
 beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be, the dinner
 he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder
 whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice, and in
 desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other
 lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified
 her desire for revenge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such
 a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a
 secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the owner of such
 magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress, should
 be living in her house. Why should he devote so small a proportion of his
 money to his expenses? Until the first year was nearly at an end, Goriot
 had dined out once or twice every week, but these occasions came less
 frequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice
 a month. It was hardly expected that Mme. Vauquer should regard the
 increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency, when those
 little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. She attributed
 the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful
 wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a
 Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot's conduct gave
 some color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to give him a
 room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding reduction in her
 charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did
 without a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer asked to be paid in
 advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented, and thenceforward
 she spoke of him as "Father Goriot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but
 investigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in the
 sham countess' phrase he was "a curmudgeon." Empty-headed people who
 babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy
 them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is
 because their doings will not bear being talked about; so the highly
 respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old
 rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came about
 this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot was a man who went
 on 'Change and <i>dabbled</i> (to use the sufficiently expressive language
 of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by
 heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty
 gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs. A
 theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found
 favor at one time, but Vautrin urged that "Goriot was not sharp enough for
 one of that sort." There were yet other solutions; Father Goriot was a
 skinflint, a shark of a money-lender, a man who lived by selling lottery
 tickets. He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame
 and misery; yet, however vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion
 which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from
 their society?he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every
 one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with
 jokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion was
 in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme. Vauquer's
 view. According to her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as
 sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be very happy, was a
 libertine who had strange tastes. These are the facts upon which Mme.
 Vauquer's slanders were based.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky
 Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense,
 Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a
 young woman's light footstep on the stair; some one was going to Goriot's
 room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar. The portly
 Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be
 honest, "dressed like a goddess," and not a speck of mud on her laced
 cashmere boots, had glided in from the street like a snake, had found the
 kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot's room. Mme. Vauquer and the cook,
 listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit,
 which lasted for some time. When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady,
 the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like
 couple, under pretext of going to do her marketing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame," she reported on
 her return, "to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was a
 splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l'Estrapade, and
 <i>she</i> got into it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the window
 and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot?the sun seeks you out,"
 she said, alluding to his visitor. "<i>Peste!</i> you have good taste; she
 was very pretty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was my daughter," he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and
 the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to
 save appearances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter who
 had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this time in
 evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the dining-room, caught
 a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and much too
 distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two of them!" cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady of
 the first visit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few days later, and another young lady?a tall, well-moulded
 brunette, with dark hair and bright eyes?came to ask for M. Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three of them!" said Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her
 father, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress, and
 came in a carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Four of them!" commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie saw
 not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her
 simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her
 first visit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his
 landlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that
 a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very knowing
 of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all inclined to
 draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his sending for them to
 the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's
 indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the second year) as to
 speak of him as an "ugly old wretch." When at length her boarder declined
 to nine hundred francs a year, she asked him very insolently what he took
 her house to be, after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs. Father
 Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?" said Mme. Vauquer
 sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have only two," her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is
 broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still
 further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five francs a
 month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no longer
 required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot appeared
 for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of astonishment broke
 from his hostess at the color of his hair?a dingy olive gray. He had
 grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble; among
 all the faces round the table, his was the most woe-begone. There was no
 longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly libertine, whose eyes had only
 been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of
 the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. The disgusting color
 of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had
 taken that he might continue his career. The poor old man's mental and
 physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked
 about him. When his outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by
 calico at fourteen <i>sous</i> the ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box,
 watch-chain and trinkets, disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing
 the corn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as
 winter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin
 breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken, his cheeks,
 once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with
 wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there
 were deep furrows in his forehead. In the fourth year of his residence in
 the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self. The
 hale vermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked
 scarce forty, the stout, comfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost
 bucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at
 him; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into
 his dotage, and had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray
 color; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of
 blood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in others.
 The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of
 his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle; and, after teasing
 him for some time to no purpose, they declared that cretinism was setting
 in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him, "So
 those daughters of yours don't come to see you any more, eh?" meaning to
 imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot shrank as if his
 hostess had touched him with a sword-point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They come sometimes," he said in a tremulous voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha! you still see them sometimes?" cried the students. "Bravo, Father
 Goriot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that
 followed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that
 these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his lack of
 intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been deeply
 interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems were more
 obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had really
 been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily
 discoverable; but the old people, who were most inquisitive as to his
 concerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and lived in the
 lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest, the
 current of life in Paris daily awaited them, and swept them away with it;
 so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they forgot the
 existence of the old man, their butt at dinner. For those narrow souls, or
 for careless youth, the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its
 dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of
 intelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme.
 Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic
 sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till
 they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont
 to reason thus:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who
 came here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the third
 floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about dressed
 like a poor man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the
 month of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this drama,
 every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the
 poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses had
 reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of human mollusk who
 should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the dinner contingent, an
 <i>employe</i> at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own. Poiret was
 an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. Poiret would join the talk,
 argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a matter of fact, his talk,
 arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the conversation, for
 Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words;
 still, he did join in the talk; he was alive, and seemed capable of
 feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote the Museum official again) was
 invariably at zero degrees?Reaumur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not
 unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those
 whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for the
 time being they rise above the ordinary level.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law
 had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its
 amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to
 learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs of the
 labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the language, and become
 familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must explore its recesses,
 good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and form some idea
 of the treasures contained in galleries and museums.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all
 sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He has his
 hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France, paid to talk
 down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat, and strikes
 various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at
 the Opera-Comique. As he passes through all these successive initiations,
 and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of life widen around him, and
 at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of
 which it is composed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons
 in the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of envying their
 owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went
 back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as
 bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had
 vanished, so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces; he
 had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier
 ambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. His
 father and mother, his two brothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt,
 whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of
 Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand francs; and
 though the amount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a
 vine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve
 hundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the
 poverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them; he
 could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful to his
 boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty of his
 dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him. It did
 not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house, nor that the
 wine they drank was made from the second pressing; a multitude of small
 things, which it is useless to speak of in detail here, made him burn to
 distinguish himself, and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing entirely
 to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament, the
 execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on
 youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea, uncertain how to spend
 its energies, whither to steer its course, how to adapt its sails to the
 winds. At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his
 work, but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and
 connections; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social
 life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a
 protectress there. Surely a clever and high-spirited young man, whose wit
 and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the
 vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination, need
 not despair of finding a protectress. These ideas occurred to him in his
 country walks with his sisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The
 girls thought him very much changed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved
 among the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young man's
 ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which had been like
 nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of a social
 success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the
 Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt about those relations; some of
 the old ties might still hold good. After much shaking of the branches of
 the family tree, the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons
 who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich
 relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse. To
 this lady, therefore, she wrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending
 Eugene to her; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing
 Mme. de Beauseant, the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations.
 A few days after his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt's
 letter to Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a
 ball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at the
 Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant's ball, Eugene came in at two
 o'clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up for the
 lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time that he had
 attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The spell
 of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld the pomp and splendor
 of the world. He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer; the boarders
 probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance,
 as he had done sometimes on former occasions, after a fete at the Prado,
 or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk stockings thereby, and ruining
 his pumps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing
 the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that moment, could go
 up to his room without making any noise, followed by Christophe, who made
 a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and
 slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel, and prepared for
 his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned
 by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his
 law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de
 Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her house was thought to
 be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. And not only so, she
 was, by right of her fortune, and the name she bore, one of the most
 conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. Thanks to the aunt, thanks
 to Mme. de Marcillac's letter of introduction, the poor student had been
 kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus
 shown to him. It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to
 those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in
 Paris, and now all doors were open for him. Eugene had been dazzled at
 first by the brilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words
 with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess among
 this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to
 attract a young man's fancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she had
 one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark eyes,
 a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a fiery energy in
 her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "a
 thoroughbred," "a pure pedigree," these figures of speech have replaced
 the "heavenly angel" and Ossianic nomenclature; the old mythology of love
 is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But for Rastignac, Mme.
 Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had
 contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan,
 and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where shall I meet you again, Madame?" he asked abruptly, and the tones
 of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, everywhere!" said she, "in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own
 house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he
 could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making the
 best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she
 gave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's,
 the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her
 house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt convinced that he must
 make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not
 laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth
 of that period; the coterie of Maulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de
 Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in
 all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in
 Paris?Lady Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de
 Kergarouet, Mme. de Serizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse
 Ferraud, Mme. de Lanty, the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the
 Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesse de
 Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. Luckily, therefore, for him, the novice
 happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de
 Langeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned that
 the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the watch
 for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams, and behold
 two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de
 Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall on your knees
 before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d'Antin; to look at one
 glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious that, possessing
 sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and protection there in a
 feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which
 you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is
 impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing
 poles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and
 Poverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the
 dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned the
 future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of
 success? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of the
 present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de Restaud's
 side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph,
 broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the student, who took
 the sound for a death groan. He opened his door noiselessly, went out upon
 the landing, and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door.
 Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill; he went over and
 looked through the keyhole; the old man was busily engaged in an
 occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was
 only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the
 self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a
 silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them;
 he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being
 crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to convert
 the richly wrought metal into ingots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Peste!</i> what a man!" said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot's
 muscular arms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with
 the aid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. "Was he then,
 indeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility
 and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his
 pursuits the more securely?" Eugene stood for a moment revolving these
 questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table with
 a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver
 into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!" said Eugene to
 himself when the bar was nearly finished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes, he
 blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the
 silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is mad," thought the student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Poor child!</i>" Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those
 words, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his
 neighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from
 the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by two men
 coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there certainly were,
 he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no sound of opening the
 street door, no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly, too, he saw a faint
 gleam of light on the second story; it came from M. Vautrin's room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!" he said to
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of gold
 reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and again he
 distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a door being
 opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds growing
 fainter as they went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is there?" cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I, Mme. Vauquer," answered Vautrin's deep bass voice. "I am coming in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts," said Eugene, going back to his
 room. "You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean to know
 all that is going on about you in Paris."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook
 himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's
 suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud's face swam again and again before
 his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay down and
 slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up his mind that he will
 work all night, the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep
 till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the
 most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time; even the
 most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather,
 and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock. On
 this morning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer still lay abed.
 Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat comfortably taking
 their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the
 milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own, and to boil the
 remainder for some time, so that madame should not discover this illegal
 exaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sylvie," said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee,
 "M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two people come
 to see him again last night. If madame says anything, mind you say nothing
 about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has he given you something?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying,
 'Hold your tongue.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn't look twice at every penny,
 there's no one in the house that doesn't try to get back with the left
 hand all that they give with the right at New Year," said Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And, after all," said Christophe, "what do they give you? A miserable
 five-franc piece. There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes
 himself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who goes
 without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his
 boots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a
 couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes, and he sells his
 old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. Oh! they're a
 shabby lot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pooh!" said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, "our places are the best in the
 Quarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe;
 has any one told you anything about him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me,
 'There's a gentleman in your place, isn't there? a tall man that dyes his
 whiskers?' I told him, 'No, sir; they aren't dyed. A gay fellow like him
 hasn't the time to do it.' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards,
 he said, 'Quite right, my boy. That is the way to answer them. There is
 nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known; it
 might spoil many a match.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and for my part," said Sylvie, "a man tried to humbug me at the
 market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh!
 There," she cried, interrupting herself, "that's a quarter to ten striking
 at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight
 o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot started off
 somewhere with a parcel, and the student won't be back from his lecture
 till ten o'clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs; Father
 Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as hard as iron. What is
 the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as a plaything for the rest
 of them; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man, all the same,
 and worth more than all of them put together. He doesn't give you much
 himself, but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out
 famous tips; they are dressed grandly, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have never been to more than two?the two who came here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise a
 fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don't let the cat
 get at it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sylvie went up to her mistress' room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sylvie! How is this? It's nearly ten o'clock, and you let me sleep like a
 dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how about breakfast?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bah! the boarders are possessed, I'm sure. They all cleared out before
 there was a wink of daylight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do speak properly, Sylvie," Mme. Vauquer retorted; "say a blink of
 daylight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have breakfast at
 ten o'clock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred. There
 are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping like the logs they
 are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As if what?" said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. "The two of them make a
 pair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is a strange thing, isn't it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last night
 after Christophe had bolted the door?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and undid
 the door. And here are you imagining that???"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the rest
 of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears on the
 table, those at five a penny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat
 knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all
 haste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mistigris!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!" she said. "Sylvie! Sylvie!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, madame; what is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just see what the cat has done!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is all that stupid Christophe's fault. I told him to stop and lay the
 table. What has become of him? Don't you worry, madame; Father Goriot
 shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won't know the
 difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?" said Mme. Vauquer, setting
 the plates round the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have overslept myself," said Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the
 sitting-room, singing loudly:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "'Tis the same old story everywhere,
 A roving heart and a roving glance..
</pre>
 <p>
 "Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!" he cried at the sight of his hostess,
 and he put his arm gaily round her waist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There! have done??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Impertinence!' Say it!" he answered. "Come, say it! Now, isn't that what
 you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table. Ah! I am a
 nice man, am I not?
 </p><br>

</pre>
 <p>
 "What?" asked the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past
 eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there, and
 Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum. It had been
 twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that's not used to the trade."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really? You don't say so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him off
 on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. I waited after
 that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical affair. He came
 back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Gres, and went into a
 money-lender's house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up rascal,
 that would make dominoes out of his father's bones, a Turk, a heathen, an
 old Jew, a Greek; it would be a difficult matter to rob <i>him</i>, for he
 puts all his coin into the Bank."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what was Father Goriot doing there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doing?" said Vautrin. "Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is a
 simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There he is!" cried Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Christophe," cried Father Goriot's voice, "come upstairs with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where are you going?" Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out on an errand for M. Goriot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What may that be?" said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe's
 hand. "<i>Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud</i>," he read. "Where are
 you going with it?" he added, as he gave the letter back to Christophe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is there inside it?" said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the
 light. "A banknote? No." He peered into the envelope. "A receipted
 account!" he cried. "My word! 'tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you, old
 chap," he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe's head, and spinning
 the man round like a thimble; "you will have a famous tip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme. Vauquer
 was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin, who
 kept humming to himself:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "The same old story everywhere,
 A roving heart and a roving glance."
</pre>
 <p>
 When everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where have you been this morning, fair lady?" said Mme. Vauquer, turning
 to Mme. Couture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is
 the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She is
 trembling like a leaf," Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself before
 the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Warm yourself, Victorine," said Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften
 your father's heart," said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the
 orphan girl; "but that is not enough. What you want is a friend who will
 give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three millions
 (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a pretty girl needs a
 dowry nowadays."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor child!" said Mme. Vauquer. "Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a
 father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked
 herself at a sign from Mme. Couture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If we could only see him!" said the Commissary-General's widow; "if I
 could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter! I have
 never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my handwriting??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!'" exclaimed Vautrin, breaking
 in upon her. "So that is how you are, is it? In a few days' time I will
 look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! sir," said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin, who
 showed no sign of being touched by it, "if you know of any way of
 communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his
 affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the
 world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will pray to
 God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>The same old story everywhere</i>," sang Vautrin, with a satirical
 intonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret came
 downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was
 making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven people
 thus assembled bade each other good-morning, and took their places at the
 table; the clock struck ten, and the student's footstep was heard outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! here you are, M. Eugene," said Sylvie; "every one is breakfasting at
 home to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside
 Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have just met with a queer adventure," he said, as he helped himself
 abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme. Vauquer's
 eyes gauged as usual.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An adventure?" queried Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?" Vautrin asked
 of Poiret. "M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell us about your adventure!" demanded M. Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the
 Vicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms are hung
 with silk?in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy as
 a king?-"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fisher," put in Vautrin, interrupting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean, sir?" said Eugene sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I said 'fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than
 kings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king,"
 said Poiret the ditto-ist, "because??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fact"?the law-student cut him short?"I danced with one of
 the handsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite
 creature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and she
 had the loveliest bouquet of flowers?real flowers, that scented the
 air??but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman
 glowing with the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning
 I met this divine countess about nine o'clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres.
 Oh! how my heart beat! I began to think??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That she was coming here," said Vautrin, with a keen look at the student.
 "I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a money-lender. If
 ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart, you will find the money-lender
 first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess is called Anastasie de
 Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at the
 words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and
 uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!" cried
 Goriot, with anguish in his voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is just as I guessed," said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Mme.
 Vauquer's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was
 doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own
 thoughts than he did at that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha! there you are!" answered Vautrin. "Old Father Goriot there knew it
 quite well! and why should I not know it too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. Goriot?" the student cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" asked the old man. "So she was very beautiful, was she,
 yesterday night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mme. de Restaud."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at the old wretch," said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; "how his
 eyes light up!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then does he really keep her?" said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to the
 student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty," Eugene answered. Father Goriot
 watched him with eager eyes. "If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there, my
 divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the younger
 men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list, and she
 danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must have
 enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying that there is
 no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a galloping horse, or
 a woman dancing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So the wheel turns," said Vautrin; "yesterday night at a duchess' ball,
 this morning in a money-lender's office, on the lowest rung of the ladder?just
 like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to pay for their
 frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if they cannot do
 that, they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay
 for their splendor. They will turn the world upside down. Just a
 Parisienne through and through!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot's face, which had shone at the student's words like the sun
 on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of
 Vautrin's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mme. Vauquer, "but where is your adventure? Did you speak to
 her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She did not see me," said Eugene. "But only think of meeting one of the
 prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock! She could
 not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning. Wasn't
 it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pshaw! much funnier things than <i>that</i> happen here!" exclaimed
 Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the
 thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme. Couture made a
 sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two ladies went out,
 and Father Goriot followed their example.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, did you see?" said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest of
 the circle. "He is ruining himself for those women, that is plain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud
 is anything to Father Goriot," cried the student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and if you don't," broke in Vautrin, "we are not set on convincing
 you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later on you will
 find out that there are what we call men with a passion??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They seemed
 to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse. "Aha!" said
 Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance, "so we
 have had our little experiences, have we?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he went on, "when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads,
 they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some particular spring?it
 is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell their wives and families,
 they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. For some this
 spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or music, or a collection of
 pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who can give them the
 dainties they like. You might offer these last all the women on earth?they
 would turn up their noses; they will have the only one who can gratify
 their passion. It often happens that the woman does not care for them at
 all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very
 dear; but no matter, the fools are never tired of it; they will take their
 last blanket to the pawnbroker's to give their last five-franc piece to
 her. Father Goriot here is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the
 Countess exploits him?just the way of the gay world. The poor old
 fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. In all other respects you see he
 is a stupid animal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like
 diamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate
 himself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's
 in the Rue des Gres. And now, mark what follows?he came back here,
 and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a
 Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a receipted bill inside
 it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went
 herself to the old money lender. Father Goriot has financed her
 handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together; the thing is
 self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all the time your
 Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her peach-flower crowned
 head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her slippers were pinching
 her, as they say; she was thinking of her protested bills, or her lover's
 protested bills."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have made me wild to know the truth," cried Eugene; "I will go to
 call on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," echoed Poiret; "you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment for
 the assistance he politely rendered."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene looked disgusted. "Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And an uncommonly queer slough, too," replied Vautrin. "The mud splashes
 you as you drive through it in your carriage?you are a respectable
 person; you go afoot and are splashed?you are a scoundrel. You are
 so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody
 else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du
 Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed out in every
 salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police and
 the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law and order! A pretty
 slate of things it is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What," cried Mme. Vauquer, "has Father Goriot really melted down his
 silver posset-dish?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that there were."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, was he fond of it?" said Eugene. "He cried while he was breaking up
 the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was dear to him as his own life," answered the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!" cried Vautrin. "The
 woman yonder can coax the soul out of him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments later
 Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for
 them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they went together to
 spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, those two are as good as married," was the portly Sylvie's comment.
 "They are going out together to-day for the first time. They are such a
 couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they
 will draw sparks like flint and steel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau's shawl, then," said Mme. Vauquer,
 laughing; "it would flare up like tinder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At four o'clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light of
 two smoky lamps, that Victorine's eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer was
 listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer;
 it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application
 made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them a personal
 interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear lady," said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, "just imagine
 it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was standing the whole
 time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting himself in a passion,
 that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that the young
 lady (he would not call her his daughter) was injuring her cause by
 importuning him (<i>importuning!</i> once a year, the wretch!); that as
 Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought not to
 expect anything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things, that
 made the poor child burst out crying. The little thing threw herself at
 her father's feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she only persevered
 in her visits for her mother's sake; that she would obey him without a
 murmur, but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell
 letter. She took it up and gave it to him, saying the most beautiful
 things in the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not know where she
 learned them; God must have put them into her head, for the poor child was
 inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her
 talk. And what do you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting
 his nails! He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with
 tears, and flung it on to the chimney-piece. 'That is all right,' he said.
 He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with
 kisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous, isn't it? And his great
 booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What inhuman wretches they must be!" said Father Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And then they both went out of the room," Mme. Couture went on, without
 heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation; "father and son bowed
 to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business! That is
 the history of our call. Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate. How
 he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as alike as
 two peas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and
 empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and
 witty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point
 consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is
 always changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword
 suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street
 song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a month.
 Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and
 shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention, which
 carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given
 rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with <i>rama</i>.
 The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the
 boarders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret," said the <i>employe</i> from the Museum, "how
 is your health-orama?" Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to
 Mme. Couture and Victorine with a "Ladies, you seem melancholy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is dinner ready?" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend
 of Rastignac's; "my stomach is sinking <i>usque ad talones</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is an uncommon <i>frozerama</i> outside," said Vautrin. "Make room
 there, Father Goriot! Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of the
 stove."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Illustrious M. Vautrin," put in Bianchon, "why do you say <i>frozerama</i>?
 It is incorrect; it should be <i>frozenrama</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it shouldn't," said the official from the Museum; "<i>frozerama</i>
 is right by the same rule that you say 'My feet are <i>froze</i>.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! ah!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of
 Contraries," cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost
 throttling him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hallo there! hallo!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party, and
 took her place beside the three women without saying a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That old bat always makes me shudder," said Bianchon in a low voice,
 indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. "I have studied Gall's system, and
 I am sure she has the bump of Judas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you have seen a case before?" said Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who has not?" answered Bianchon. "Upon my word, that ghastly old maid
 looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through, give
 them time enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is the way, young man," returned he of the forty years and the dyed
 whiskers:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "The rose has lived the life of a rose?
 A morning's space."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Aha! here is a magnificent <i>soupe-au-rama</i>," cried Poiret as
 Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beg your pardon, sir," said Mme. Vauquer; "it is <i>soupe aux choux</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the young men roared with laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Had you there, Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Score two points to Mamma Vauquer," said Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did any of you notice the fog this morning?" asked the official.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was a frantic fog," said Bianchon, "a fog unparalleled, doleful,
 melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical?a Goriot of a fog!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A Goriorama," said the art student, "because you couldn't see a thing in
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door
 through which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a
 scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired in
 his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle of
 spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, "and is there anything
 the matter with the bread?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing whatever, madame," he answered; "on the contrary, it is made of
 the best quality of corn; flour from Etampes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How could you tell?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By the color, by the flavor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose," said Mme. Vauquer. "You
 have grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell of
 cooking at last."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take out a patent for it, then," cried the Museum official; "you would
 make a handsome fortune."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind him," said the artist; "he does that sort of thing to delude
 us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?" inquired the official.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn <i>what</i>?" asked Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-el."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-et."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-elian."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-ice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-ucopia."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-crake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-cockle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn-orama."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room,
 and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father
 Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a foreigner trying
 to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn?..." he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corn on your foot, old man!" said Vautrin, and he drove Father Goriot's
 cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to
 do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had
 finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his
 eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. "You
 are a disagreeable joker, sir," said the old man, "and if you take any
 further liberties with me??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what then, old boy?" Vautrin interrupted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Down below, eh?" said the artist, "in the little dark corner where they
 put naughty boys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, mademoiselle," Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, "you are eating
 nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A monster!" said Mme. Couture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she is
 not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring at
 Mlle. Victorine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at the
 poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,?the slighted
 love of a child whose father would not recognize her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy," said Eugene in a low
 voice. "He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system on
 him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a silver dish last
 night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something
 extraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. His
 life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. Oh! you may laugh,
 Bianchon; I am not joking."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The man is a subject, is he?" said Bianchon; "all right! I will dissect
 him, if he will give me the chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; feel his bumps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hm!?his stupidity might perhaps be contagious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three
 o'clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way
 thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young
 head so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no account
 of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every direction;
 imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a romance; they are
 saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes
 that have no existence save in their heated fancy. If youth were not
 ignorant and timid, civilization would be impossible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition, but
 on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and
 what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit, rehearsed
 repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and prepared certain
 neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of small events which
 should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his
 future; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud,
 and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his
 boots blacked and his trousers brushed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I were rich," he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had
 brought with him in case anything might happen, "I would take a cab, then
 I could think at my ease."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de
 Restaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen
 him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who knows that he
 will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at once,
 for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court, where a
 smart cab was waiting. All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be
 implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. A
 fine horse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the ground, and all at once
 the law student felt out of humor with himself. Every compartment in his
 brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew
 positively stupid. He sent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the
 ante-chamber, standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon
 the court; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared
 before him. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the
 southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is
 single-minded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir," said
 the servant. "She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the
 dining-room, there is some one already there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey
 who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened the door
 by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber, meaning, no doubt, to
 show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house; but he
 found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room
 full of dressers, where lamps were standing, and hot-water pipes, on which
 towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond
 it. Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This way to the drawing-room, sir," said the servant, with the
 exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck, he
 managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from immersion in the
 water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the further end of the dark
 passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices and the
 sound of a kiss; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud, the other was
 Father Goriot. Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into
 the drawing-room; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard,
 and stood there for a while. He meant to know whether this Goriot was
 really the Goriot that he knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast; he
 remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man
 suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it, saying
 impatiently to the servant who stood at the door: "I am going, Maurice.
 Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be insolent,
 sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where Eugene was
 standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's
 face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is disengaged,"
 said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had
 emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul was
 preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate
 had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon at his
 button-hole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and
 save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella, swerved, and dashed
 forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked round in
 annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he went out with
 constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a money-lender so
 long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel it
 necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon, so
 that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a
 little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. All this happened with
 lightning speed. Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he
 was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Maxime, were you going away?" she said reproachfully, with a shade of
 pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the
 entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing
 before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots
 of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly coiled
 about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning; there was
 a soft fragrance about her?doubtless she was fresh from a bath;?her
 graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes
 glistened. A young man can see everything at a glance; he feels the
 radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment
 from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool
 freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing
 gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of a bare throat, on
 which the student's eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the
 adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her
 slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet, thrust into
 slippers, were daintily small. As Maxime took her hand and kissed it,
 Eugene became aware of Maxime's existence, and the Countess saw Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you," she said,
 but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have
 taken as a hint to depart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the
 haughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from the
 lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of
 the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given
 in the words: "Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little
 whipper-snapper about his business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness
 that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart, and Rastignac all at once
 began to hate him violently. To begin with, the sight of the fair
 carefully arranged curls on the other's comely head had convinced him that
 his own crop was hideous; Maxime's boots, moreover, were elegant and
 spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore some traces of his
 recent walk; and, finally, Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his
 figure gracefully, he looked like a pretty woman, while Eugene was wearing
 a black coat at half-past two. The quick-witted child of the Charente felt
 the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy,
 with the clear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin
 orphan children without scruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room
 without waiting for Eugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her
 dressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a white butterfly,
 and Maxime hurried after her. Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the
 Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the
 large drawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime
 found him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud,
 he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that he had
 seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant's ball; he guessed the
 relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the youthful
 audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he
 said to himself, "This is my rival; I mean to cut him out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would
 wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugene
 was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye
 twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair
 by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so
 sulkily, that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned to
 Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, "Why do you
 not go?" a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their
 exit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene assumed an amiable expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," he began, "I hastened to call upon you??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly
 appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he
 looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand to Maxime with a
 cordial "Good morning," that astonished Eugene not a little. The young
 provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. de Restaud," said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law
 student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene bowed profoundly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This gentleman," she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, "is M.
 de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the
 Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!</i>
 These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by
 reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she
 only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a
 magical effect. The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned
 the student's bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly
 dropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a
 fairy's wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open
 again; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a
 sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and
 he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. Mme. Vauquer's
 lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct," the Comte de Restaud said,
 addressing Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, they are extinct," answered the law student. "My great-uncle, the
 Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac family. They
 had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de Clarimbault, Mme. de
 Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side. We are the younger branch of
 the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my
 great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he had in the King's service.
 The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the
 Compagnie des Indes was liquidated."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was not your great-uncle in command of the <i>Vengeur</i> before 1789?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the <i>Warwick</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who should
 say, "If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is
 all over with us." Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles
 gave her. With a woman's admirable tact, she began to smile and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave you
 two gentlemen to sail in company on board the <i>Warwick</i> and the <i>Vengeur</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and
 mischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the
 boudoir. The <i>morganatic</i> couple (to use a convenient German
 expression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the
 Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anastasie!" he cried pettishly, "just stay a moment, dear; you know very
 well that??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am coming back in a minute," she interrupted; "I have a commission for
 Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her
 husband's voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the
 boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands'
 characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to
 know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding,
 she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. It was
 Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess
 looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of
 exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the Countess, and Eugene
 with the pointed remark, "You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you;
 good-day," and he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just wait a moment, Maxime!" the Count called after him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and dine with us," said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her husband
 together once more. She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room,
 where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had
 taken his leave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in
 their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de
 Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the end that he
 might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with
 Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Maxime
 clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the secret tie that bound
 her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate, hoping by
 its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anastasie!" the Count called again to his wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Maxime!" she said, addressing the young man. "Come, we must resign
 ourselves. This evening??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope, Nasie," he said in her ear, "that you will give orders not to
 admit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at
 you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you will
 compel me to kill him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you mad, Maxime?" she said. "A young lad of a student is, on the
 contrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I mean
 to make Restaud furiously jealous of him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who
 stood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and
 made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had been
 closed after him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you think, dear?" cried the Count, her husband, "this gentleman's
 family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle
 and my grandfather were acquainted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common," said the
 Countess, with a preoccupied manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "More than you think," said Eugene, in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean?" she asked quickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, only just now," said the student, "I saw a gentleman go out at the
 gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am
 lodging."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count,
 who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had burned
 his fingers, and rose to his feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir," he cried, "you might have called him 'Monsieur Goriot'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation,
 then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer was made in a
 tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of assumed
 carelessness:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You could not know any one who is dearer to us both..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind,
 and asked, "Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Exceedingly," answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim
 suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you sing?" she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it,
 she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, madame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.?<i>Ca-ro,
 ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re</i>," sang the Countess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name,
 but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the
 formula "related to Mme. de Beauseant." His position was not unlike that
 of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of
 curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass
 case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads, imperfectly
 secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow
 him. Mme. de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had
 grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky
 student of law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," he said, "you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to wish
 you good-day??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, "Whenever you
 come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Restaud,
 who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the
 hall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls,"
 the Count said to Maurice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," said he to himself, "somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do
 not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the
 bargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never look
 to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into
 society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished boots,
 gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear white doeskin
 gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every
 evening? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had
 probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing
 better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his
 employer's knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella, remarked his black
 coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and
 looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the blind desperation that drives a
 young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope
 to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the
 driver's signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray petals of orange
 blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a
 wedding party.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where am I to drive, sir?" demanded the man, who, by this time, had taken
 off his white gloves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Confound it!" Eugene said to himself, "I am in for it now, and at least I
 will not spend cab-hire for nothing!?Drive to the Hotel Beauseant,"
 he said aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which?" asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to
 confusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that
 there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was in
 relations who did not care about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "De Grenelle," interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. "You see,
 there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue
 Saint-Dominique," he added, drawing up the step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know all about that," said Eugene, severely.?"Everybody is
 laughing at me to-day, it seems!" he said to himself, as he deposited his
 hat on the opposite seat. "This escapade will cost me a king's ransom,
 but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly
 aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs already, the old
 scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant about my adventure;
 perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the
 criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a
 tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in
 contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive
 tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the
 scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect.
 Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven,
 you must face God."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up
 in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance
 as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though he was about
 to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him,
 the money was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and
 his cabman's cry of "Gate, if you please," almost put him in spirits. A
 Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its
 hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass
 under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning.
 The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let down the step.
 As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the
 peristyle. Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal
 appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law student was
 enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of
 the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in
 Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold
 a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud's
 courtyard, in the Chaussee d'Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a
 young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the
 luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have
 purchased it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who can be here?" said Eugene to himself. He began to understand, though
 somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who
 were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one of these queens
 would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. "Confound it all! I
 expect my cousin also has her Maxime."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door
 was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the
 curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground
 floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so closely on the
 invitation, that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had
 therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant's apartments; he was about to
 behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant
 surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was
 the more curious, because Mme. de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him
 with a standard of comparison.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five minutes
 earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene knew nothing of
 the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted up the
 wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the gilded
 balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Beauseant's
 apartments. He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Beauseant, one
 of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in
 the salons of Paris.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that
 of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the
 Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent <i>liaisons</i> which
 possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they
 find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Beauseant,
 therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the world by
 respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. Any
 one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this
 friendship was sure to find the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto there. As, under the
 circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against
 these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much
 interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could fail to understand
 how much he bored her; and when it became known in Paris that Mme. de
 Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock, she was left
 in perfect solitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to
 the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d'Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant,
 like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese
 as soon as he had installed them. But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a
 Mlle. de Rochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world
 there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and
 that was Mme. de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the
 possibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted
 those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the bans were about
 to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to
 break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say
 one word about his treachery. How was it? Nothing is doubtless more
 difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are
 men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who
 threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman
 who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead
 swoon and requires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was
 on thorns, and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way
 or other the news would reach Mme. de Beauseant; he would write, it would
 be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should
 stab her to the heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis
 d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even
 more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the
 monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she
 instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser
 detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was
 impossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that
 involuntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling
 in its artlessness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any
 house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of
 its owner, and of its owner's wife and family, so that he may avoid making
 any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque
 exclamation, "Harness five bullocks to your cart!" probably because you
 will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step
 has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our language has no name for
 these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed
 to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so
 prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud's, no one but
 Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de
 Beauseant's drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles had
 found him horribly in the way, M. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye," said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made his
 entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where luxury
 seemed nothing more than good taste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Until this evening," said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give the
 Marquis a glance. "We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot go," he said, with his fingers on the door handle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the
 slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling
 marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story out of the
 Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the
 woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse
 had raised the forefinger of her right hand, and gracefully signed to the
 Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the imperious sway of
 passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. Eugene watched him, not
 without a feeling of envy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is the owner of the brougham!" he said to himself. "But is it
 necessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and
 torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his
 throat was parched with the thirst of gold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother,
 brothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among
 them. This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he
 had in view helped to benumb his faculties.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?" the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese.
 "Why cannot you come to the Italiens?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Throw him over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add
 lie to lie. M. d'Ajuda therefore said, smiling, "Do you lay your commands
 on me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was what I wanted to have you say to me," he answered, dissembling
 his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took the Vicomtesse's hand, kissed it, and went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow.
 He thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her attention; but
 suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and
 watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order that
 he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To M. de Rochefide's house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those words, and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the
 carriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she
 walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most
 terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse went
 to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty
 notepaper.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,"
 she wrote, "you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an
 explanation, which I am waiting to hear."
</pre>
 <p>
 She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that
 they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for
 "Claire de Bourgogne," and rang the bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jacques," she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, "take this
 note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis
 d'Ajuda. If M. d'Ajuda is there, leave the note without waiting for an
 answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! yes, of course," she said, opening the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the
 Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her
 voice vibrated through his heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, monsieur," she said; "I had a letter to write. Now I am quite
 at liberty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought,
 "Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still free? This
 evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else... But before to-morrow
 I shall know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cousin..." the student replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh?" said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder
 through Eugene; he understood what that "Eh?" meant; he had learned a
 great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. He reddened:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame..." he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. "Pardon me;
 I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship
 could do me no harm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now she
 felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with
 the storm that was about to burst.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you knew how my family are situated," he went on, "you would love to
 play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the
 obstacles from the path of her protege."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, cousin," she said, laughing, "and how can I be of service to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this obscure
 and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You have
 confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to
 you. I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah! if I could only ask you to
 counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling
 to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you kill a man for me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You, child. Yes, you are a child," she said, keeping back the tears that
 came to her eyes; "you would love sincerely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" he cried, flinging up his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. The
 southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between Mme. de
 Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant's rose-colored drawing-room
 he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a
 recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence,
 and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of every kind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! that is what I meant to say!" said Eugene. "I met Mme. de Restaud at
 your ball, and this morning I went to see her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must have been very much in the way," said Mme. de Beauseant, smiling
 as she spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against
 me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very
 difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion
 who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so well?life.
 I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you
 to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of
 blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame la Duchess de Langeais," Jacques cut the student short; Eugene
 gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you mean to succeed," said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, "in the
 first place you must not be so demonstrative."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! good morning, dear," she continued, and rising and crossing the room,
 she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been
 sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two intimate friends!" said Rastignac to himself. "Henceforward I shall
 have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and
 this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear
 Antoinette?" asked Mme. de Beauseant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door, so I thought that
 if I came I should find you alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her
 expression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the
 Duchess uttered those deadly words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I had known that you were engaged??" the speaker added,
 glancing at Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins," said the
 Vicomtesse. "Have you any news of General de Montriveau?" she continued.
 "Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been to
 see you to-day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de
 Montriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in
 her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was at the Elysee yesterday."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In attendance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Claire," returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she
 threw at Mme. de Beauseant; "of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is
 going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans will be published to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse's face grew white, but she
 answered, laughing, "One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with.
 What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal
 to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is
 settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. "What was the blunder that you
 made, monsieur?" she asked. "The poor boy is only just launched into the
 world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that we are
 speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow.
 Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal
 communication can be accompanied by official confirmation."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man
 from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud's heart;
 unwittingly?therein lies my offence," said the student of law, whose
 keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected the
 biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. "You continue to
 receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they
 deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he
 wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his
 opportunities, and every one despises him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which
 a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law
 student, who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny; she
 had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise
 its value.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de
 Restaud; for I should tell you, madame," he went on, turning to the
 Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, "that as yet
 I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and
 very poor??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care about
 anything that no one else will take."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bah!" said Eugene. "I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind
 to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my sins, and
 it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional; you
 commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in
 another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Duchess' expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of
 these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by
 turning to the Vicomtesse with?"This gentleman has only just come??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess
 both.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who
 will give him lessons in good taste."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mme. la Duchesse," said Eugene, "is it not natural to wish to be
 initiated into the mysteries which charm us?" ("Come, now," he said to
 himself, "my language is superfinely elegant, I'm sure.")
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles' pupil," said
 the Duchess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of that I had no idea, madame," answered the law student, "so I rashly
 came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady's husband,
 and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell
 them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went
 out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the
 end of a passage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who was it?" both women asked together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg
 Saint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly
 unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him?we all call him
 'Father Goriot.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, child that you are," cried the Vicomtesse, "Mme. de Restaud was a
 Mlle. Goriot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer," the Duchess added; "and when
 the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was
 presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began to
 laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People?what was it??people??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Ejusdem farinoe</i>," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that was it," said the Duchess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! is that her father?" the law student continued, aghast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to
 speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?" the
 Vicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, "a Baron de Nucingen? And
 her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn't she a fair-haired woman who has a
 side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs
 loudly to attract attention."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Duchess smiled and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that
 kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be infatuated
 with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not find her a good
 bargain! She is in M. de Trailles' hands, and he will ruin her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And they do not acknowledge their father!" Eugene repeated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father," replied the
 Vicomtesse, "a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand
 francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well; while
 he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking
 that his daughters would always be his daughters, thinking that in them he
 would live his life twice over again, that in their houses he should find
 two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. And
 in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses
 as if he were one of the lowest outcasts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Tears came into Eugene's eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful
 beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred
 within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization
 in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three
 looked at each other in silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Eh, mon Dieu!</i>" said Mme. de Langeais; "yes, it seems very
 horrible, and yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for
 it? Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A
 son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one,
 bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will
 be the joy of her family, its 'white soul,' as Lamartine says, and
 suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her from us,
 his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all
 the old affection in our darling's heart, and all the ties that bound her
 to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no
 one but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her;
 by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger. The tragedy is
 always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a father who has
 sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last
 degree of insolence. On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his
 wife's mother out of the house. I sometimes hear it said that there is
 nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the
 Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come
 to be very poor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old
 vermicelli maker's case. I think I recollect that Foriot??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goriot, madame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution.
 He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the
 foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its
 cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother's steward sold him
 immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee
 of Public Salvation, as that sort of person always did. I recollect the
 steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in
 complete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of
 civism. Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has
 never had but one passion, they say?he idolizes his daughters. He
 settled one of them under Restaud's roof, and grafted the other into the
 Nucingen family tree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had
 turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was
 Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old
 Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud
 felt bored by the old man's society, and the banker was still more tired
 of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted 'to keep the goat
 and the cabbage,' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one
 there, under pretence of affection. 'Come to-day, papa, we shall have you
 all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!' and all that sort of
 thing. As for me, dear, I believe that love has second-sight: poor
 Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He saw that his daughters were
 ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make
 mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a
 father; he went into voluntary exile. His daughters were satisfied, so he
 thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family
 crime, and father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of
 thing everywhere. What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud
 in his daughters' drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and
 bored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that happened
 between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris
 and the man she loves the best; if her love grows tiresome, he will go; he
 will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all
 love and friendship. Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its
 wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection
 that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who
 has not a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty
 years he had given his whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them
 all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in
 the gutter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The world is very base," said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of
 her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that Mme. de
 Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the
 quick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Base? Oh, no," answered the Duchess; "the world goes its own way, that is
 all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped by it.
 I think as you do," she said, pressing the Vicomtesse's hand. "The world
 is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as she
 said: "You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such a
 lovely color in your cheeks before."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father Goriot is sublime!" said Eugene to himself, as he remembered how
 he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass
 that night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts.
 For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student
 became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally afraid to go
 or stay or speak a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured," said the Vicomtesse at
 last. "No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring
 the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while
 calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already! Ah! I
 will defend myself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings
 flashed from her proud eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" she said, as she saw Eugene, "are you there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Still," he said piteously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You are
 determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths of
 corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man's pitiful vanity.
 Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of
 life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded your
 calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly; you will be
 feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take
 a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you
 will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here, you see,
 unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and
 wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock it
 carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you will
 be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the
 victim's place. And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape
 you! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open
 your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the
 sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen, Miguel"?the
 name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake?"there
 is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who
 have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a
 rivalry between two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has
 been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her
 sister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a great
 capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen. There is
 gulf set between the sisters?indeed, they are sisters no longer?the
 two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each
 other. So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the
 Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon.
 She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made
 herself de Marsay's slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little
 about her. If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her
 Benjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so;
 if not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my
 great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will
 bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have
 shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father
 Goriot's name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty
 times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at
 home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very well,
 then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's
 house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the signal for a
 battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose
 their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends
 will all try to take you from her. There are women who will fall in love
 with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the city madams,
 poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby to acquire our
 manners. You will have a success, and in Paris success is everything; it
 is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men
 will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will
 be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go everywhere, and you will
 find out what the world is?an assemblage of fools and knaves. But
 you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like
 Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth; make no
 unworthy use of it," she said, with a queenly glance and curve of her
 throat; "give it back to me unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women
 also have our battles to fight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a
 train for you??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin's smile, and went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was five o'clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he should
 not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was
 pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical
 comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him.
 A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage;
 he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance when his belief in
 himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words, "You
 have shut the Countess' door against you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall call!" he said to himself, "and if Mme. de Beauseant is right, if
 I never find her at home?I... well, Mme. de Restaud shall meet me in
 every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice,
 and kill that Maxime of hers!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And money?" cried an inward monitor. "How about money, where is that to
 come from?" And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de
 Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which
 Goriot's daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious
 splendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous
 extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went
 under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de
 Beauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great
 world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his ideas
 widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is;
 saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion,
 and found in success the <i>ultima ratio mundi</i>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Vautrin is right, success is virtue!" he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for
 ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to
 dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen
 poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and
 the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden, and the
 contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant;
 his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On the one hand,
 he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms,
 of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces invested with all the
 charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on
 the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these
 faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but
 the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Beauseant's counsels,
 the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came
 to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to
 open two parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned
 doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child! Those
 two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are very dull, my lord Marquis," said Vautrin, with one of the shrewd
 glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me 'my lord
 Marquis,'" answered Eugene. "A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the
 veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least; and
 a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous.
 "Puppy!" it seemed to say; "I should make one mouthful of him!" Then he
 answered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de
 Restaud was not a success."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined
 at our table," cried Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Glances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have sent some snuff into my eye," he said to his neighbor, turning a
 little aside to rub his hand over his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with
 me," said Eugene, looking at the old man's neighbor; "he is worth all the
 rest of us put together.?I am not speaking of the ladies," he added,
 turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene's remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the
 dinner-table. Vautrin alone spoke. "If you are going to champion Father
 Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you had
 need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils," he said,
 banteringly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So I intend," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you are taking the field to-day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps," Rastignac answered. "But I owe no account of myself to any one,
 especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go
 behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain.
 That is enough," he added, seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a
 passion. "We can have a little talk whenever you like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was so
 deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change
 in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had met with a
 champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess," said Mme.
 Vauquer in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And of a baroness," answered Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is about all he is capable of," said Bianchon to Rastignac; "I have
 taken a look at his head; there is only one bump?the bump of
 Paternity; he must be an <i>eternal father</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke. He
 determined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant's counsels, and was asking
 himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide
 savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before
 him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was
 left in the dining-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you have seen my daughter?" Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound of
 his voice broke in upon Eugene's dreams. The young man took the elder's
 hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are a good and noble man," he said. "We will have some talk about
 your daughters by and by."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer, and went to his room. There
 he wrote the following letter to his mother:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "My Dear Mother,?Can you nourish your child from your breast
 again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want
 twelve hundred francs?I must have them at all costs. Say nothing
 about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and
 unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and
 so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when
 I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present
 situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly
 and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one
 a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you
 must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see
 the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I
 am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out
 on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go
 without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with
 which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must
 resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the
 mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set
 on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old
 jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I
 know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a
 sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask
 you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think
 of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.
 Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my
 first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you
 cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to
 sell our aunt's lace, tell her that I will send her some still
 handsomer," and so forth.
</pre>
 <p>
 He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings?would they
 despoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the
 family? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly,
 and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of
 honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings
 in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled.
 He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely
 manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his
 sisters, and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the
 orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris. Visions rose before his
 eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over
 their little store, devising some girlish stratagem by which the money
 could be sent to him <i>incognito</i>, essaying, for the first time in
 their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its
 unselfishness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A sister's heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!" he
 said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how pure
 the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What exquisite joy
 they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his mother's heart if
 she could not send him all that he asked for! And this noble affection,
 these sacrifices made at such terrible cost, were to serve as the ladder
 by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen. A few tears, like the
 last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth,
 fell from his eyes. He walked up and down, and despair mingled with his
 emotion. Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter, sir?" he asked from the threshold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a father.
 You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M. Maxime de
 Trailles, who will be her ruin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to catch
 their meaning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last
 moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into the box.
 "I shall succeed!" he said to himself. So says the gambler; so says the
 great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of some
 few, have been the ruin of many more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud's house; she was
 not at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times he found
 her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose an hour when
 M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures simply
 to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence, departed
 forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most
 students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the
 last moment before going up for his examinations; he made up his mind to
 cram his second and third years' work into the third year, when he meant
 to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law with one
 great effort. In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate
 the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring
 him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de
 Beauseant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis
 d'Ajuda drive away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic
 figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis
 d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread of losing
 her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before, but
 the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d'Ajuda and the
 Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very
 fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would gradually become
 reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be brought to
 sacrifice d'Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career,
 exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the most solemn
 promises, daily renewed, M. d'Ajuda was playing a part, and the Vicomtesse
 was eager to be deceived. "Instead of taking a leap heroically from the
 window, she is falling headlong down the staircase," said her most
 intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this after-glow of
 happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her
 young cousin. She had a half-superstitious affection for him. Eugene had
 shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no
 real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries,
 it is because he has an interested motive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's
 previous history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board
 the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be given briefly
 as follows:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a
 workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty
 workman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the
 latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot
 established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn
 Exchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President
 of the Section, so as to secure for his business the protection of those
 in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent step had led to success;
 the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity (real
 or artificial), when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in
 Paris. People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors; while other
 persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without
 brawling over it. It was during this year that Goriot made the money,
 which, at a later time, was to give him all the advantage of the great
 capitalist over the small buyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of
 average ability; his mediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no
 one's envy, it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of
 being rich was over, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on
 political, but on commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second
 to none on all questions relating to corn, flour, and "middlings"; and the
 production, storage, and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield of
 the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily,
 and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the
 regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain, who had
 seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles
 involved, his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system
 worked, would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is
 made. Patient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he
 surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. Nothing there took him by
 surprise; he foresaw all things, knew all that was happening, and kept his
 own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a
 situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding
 as a soldier on the march. But beyond this business horizon he could not
 see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop,
 leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little
 counting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted workman, a
 man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is indifferent to all
 intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the play, a Parisian Dolibom
 in short, against whose stupidity other minds are powerless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you will
 find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all-absorbing affections
 filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of every other
 feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature, as he
 put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He had regarded his
 wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with a devout
 admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had felt the charm
 of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its delicate strength, was the
 very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in
 the heart of man than the pride of protection, a protection which is
 constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature? Join love
 thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the
 source of their pleasures, and you have the explanation of many strange
 incongruities in human nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was
 very unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him
 in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under
 cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other directions
 to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of fatherhood
 developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the affection balked
 by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found full satisfaction
 for his heart in loving them. More or less brilliant proposals were made
 to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied
 with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again; but he
 determined to remain a widower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom
 he felt a decided friendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be
 faithful to his wife's memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who
 could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among
 themselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them ventured
 (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow from the
 vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin.
 He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned; his love
 for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this was so well known, that
 one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to
 himself, told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab.
 The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and
 did not return for several days afterwards; he was ill in consequence of
 the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false
 alarm. This time, however, the offender did not escape with a bruised
 shoulder; at a critical moment in the man's affairs, Goriot drove him into
 bankruptcy, and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an income of
 sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself,
 and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls. The
 best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed
 with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. They had
 a chaperon?luckily for them, she was a woman who had good sense and
 good taste;?they learned to ride; they had a carriage for their use;
 they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live; they had only to
 express a wish, their father would hasten to give them their most
 extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss.
 Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels; and, quite
 naturally, he himself was left beneath them. Poor man! he loved them even
 for the pain that they gave him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to
 choose for themselves. Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry;
 and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty, her
 social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted
 sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married Nucingen, a banker of
 German extraction, who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. Goriot
 remained a vermicelli maker as before. His daughters and his sons-in-law
 began to demur; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade,
 though his whole life was bound up with his business. For five years he
 stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded, and consented to
 retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings
 of the last few years. It was this capital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early
 days of his residence with her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten
 thousand livres in a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging-house,
 driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by
 their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their
 houses, but even to see him no more except in private.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who
 had purchased Goriot's business, information which confirmed the Duchesse
 de Langeais' suppositions, and herewith the preliminary explanation of
 this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two
 letters?one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His
 heart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of the
 familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained life or
 death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered
 their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so well that he
 could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood. His
 mother's letter ran as follows:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "MY DEAR CHILD,?I am sending you the money that you asked for.
 Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so
 large a sum a second time without your father's knowledge, and
 there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage
 the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of
 which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that
 you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation
 would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word,
 and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I
 do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter
 has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you
 were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must
 have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so
 much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are
 going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole
 life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society
 into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you
 cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for
 your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked
 ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two
 qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I
 do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am
 only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her
 foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I,
 for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your
 intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, 'Go forward,
 beloved!' If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my
 prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very
 careful, dear boy. You must have a man's prudence, for it lies
 with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to
 you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and
 your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all
 that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond
 words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to
 your gloves. 'But I have a weakness for the eldest!' she said
 gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall
 wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has
 done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are
 young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a
 piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your
 sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead
 from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she
 says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted
 woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now.
 Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out
 better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing
 about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must
 let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven
 send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed.
 I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I
 do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know
 what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children's
 sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of
 you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother."
</pre>
 <p>
 By the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought of
 Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass before he
 sold it to meet his daughter's bill of exchange.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your mother has broken up her jewels for you," he said to himself; "your
 aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them for your
 sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie? You have
 followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your own
 future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two, which
 is the worse?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that
 money. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him intolerable
 pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take into account when
 they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps the angels in
 heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice condemns.
 Rastignac opened his sister's letter; its simplicity and kindness revived
 his heart.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and
 I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money,
 that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come
 in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged
 to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and
 truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted
 most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear
 Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us
 completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two
 mad things all day, 'to such a prodigious degree' (as aunt would
 say), that mother said, with her severe expression, 'Whatever can
 be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?' I think if we had been
 scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A
 woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I,
 however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of
 all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of
 spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for
 piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not
 want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so
 economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two
 hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely
 punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful
 to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was
 so nice about it. She said, 'Let us send the three hundred and
 fifty francs in our two names!' But I could not help telling you
 everything just as it happened.

 "Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our
 glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on
 the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the
 coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales.
 We came back again like swallows on the wing. 'Don't you think
 that happiness has made us lighter?' Agathe said. We said all
 sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien,
 because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear
 brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping
 the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything
 (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother
 has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went
 with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut
 out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty
 political considerations that prompted their mission, and
 conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are
 embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty
 the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There
 be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that
 no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge
 shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some
 disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy
 a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack
 pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady
 of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes
 (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to
 light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses
 Agathe and Laure place at their brother's disposal their thread,
 their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young
 Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of
 stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of
 taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting
 switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of
 the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the
 Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth
 them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred
 canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other
 canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.

 "Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for
 your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great
 deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything,
 won't you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we
 think you must have had some success.

 "Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said...

 "Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you
 rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you
 instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice
 shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them;
 and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a
 pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good-
 bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on
 the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I
 am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has
 solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all
 the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be
 quite sure that she keeps her word.?Your loving sister,

 "LAURE DE RASTIGNAC."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Yes!" said Eugene to himself. "Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches
 could not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every sort
 of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs," he went on after a pause.
 "Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a woman! I have
 only calico shirts. Where some one else's welfare is concerned, a young
 girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless where she herself is in
 question, and full of foresight for me,?she is like a heavenly angel
 forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and
 had finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen at
 once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man's career; a tailor
 is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice for a bond
 of friendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! no middle term.
 In this representative of his craft Eugene discovered a man who understood
 that his was a sort of paternal function for young men at their entrance
 into life, who regarded himself as a stepping-stone between a young man's
 present and future. And Rastignac in gratitude made the man's fortune by
 an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a later period of his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of
 twenty thousand livres a year!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to order!
 At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts of any
 kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable air which
 the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. No sooner are
 the coins slipped into a student's pocket than his wealth, in imagination
 at least, is piled into a fantastic column, which affords him a moral
 support. He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is conscious that
 he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given point; he looks
 you straight in the face; his gestures are quick and decided; only
 yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have pushed him aside;
 to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister. A miracle has been
 wrought in him. Nothing is beyond the reach of his ambition, and his
 ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic;
 in short, the fledgling bird has discovered that he has wings. A poor
 student snatches at every chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of
 risks to steal a bone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from
 pursuit; but a young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his
 pocket can take his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the
 sweets of secure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten
 what the word <i>poverty</i> means; all Paris is his. Those are days when
 the whole world shines radiant with light, when everything glows and
 sparkles before the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is
 never brought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go
 hand in hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of
 the Seine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know
 nothing of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! if the women of Paris but knew," said Rastignac, as he devoured Mme.
 Vauquer's stewed pears (at five for a penny), "they would come here in
 search of a lover."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door of
 the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened to
 admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding out two bags
 for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. Vautrin's keen
 glance cut Eugene like a lash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the
 shooting gallery," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your ship has come in," said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes
 should betray her cupidity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have a kind mother," said Mme. Couture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have a kind mother, sir," echoed Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, mamma has been drained dry," said Vautrin, "and now you can have
 your fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with
 countesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice, young
 man, and don't neglect your pistol practice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist. Rastignac,
 meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and found nothing.
 Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your credit is good," he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac was
 forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at dinner
 that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme. de Beauseant, he had
 made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For a week, in fact, they
 had both kept silence in each other's presence, and watched each other.
 The student tried in vain to account to himself for this attitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is
 expressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as mathematically
 exact as the law that determines the course of a shell from a mortar. The
 amount of impression it makes is not to be determined so exactly.
 Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea works havoc, but there are,
 no less, natures so robustly protected, that this sort of projectile falls
 flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass, as cannon-shot against solid
 masonry; then there are flaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas
 from without sink like spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt.
 Rastignac's head was something of the powder-magazine order; the least
 shock sufficed to bring about an explosion. He was too quick, too young,
 not to be readily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence
 of thought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena
 that make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the
 time. Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the
 mental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses, had
 the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in intellects
 of a high order?slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in
 any armor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the past month Eugene's good qualities and defects had rapidly
 developed with his character. Intercourse with the world and the endeavor
 to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects. But Rastignac
 came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good qualities of his
 countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the South, that rushes to the
 attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern impatience of delay or
 suspense. These traits are held to be defects in the North; they made the
 fortune of Murat, but they likewise cut short his career. The moral would
 appear to be that when the dash and boldness of the South side of the
 Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with the guile of the North, the
 character is complete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of
 Sweden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin's batteries
 for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a foe. He felt
 as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and dissecting his
 feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that he seemed
 to have something of the profound and unmoved serenity of a sphinx, seeing
 and hearing all things and saying nothing. Eugene, conscious of that money
 in his pocket, grew rebellious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be so good as to wait a moment," he said to Vautrin, as the latter rose,
 after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What for?" inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed hat and
 took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will face
 three or four footpads without flinching.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will repay you in a minute," returned Eugene. He unsealed one of the
 bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed them
 towards Mme. Vauquer. "Short reckonings make good friends" he added,
 turning to the widow; "that clears our accounts till the end of the year.
 Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good friends make short reckonings," echoed Poiret, with a glance at
 Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is your franc," said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx
 in the black wig.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle," exclaimed
 this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the young man's
 inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile on Vautrin's face
 such as Eugene had seen scores of times already; every time he saw it, it
 exasperated him almost beyond endurance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well... so I am," he answered. He held both the bags in his hand, and had
 risen to go up to his room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the
 student turned to go through the second door that opened into the square
 lobby at the foot of the staircase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were
 saying just now was not exactly polite?" Vautrin remarked, as he rattled
 his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and came up to
 the student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the staircase,
 and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the little square
 lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place was lighted by an
 iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access into the garden. Sylvie
 came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that moment to say:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Monsieur</i> Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not
 Rastignacorama."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They will fight," said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fight!" echoed Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not they," replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But there they are under the lime-trees," cried Mlle. Victorine, who had
 risen so that she might see out into the garden. "Poor young man! he was
 in the right, after all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We must go upstairs, my pet," said Mme. Couture; "it is no business of
 ours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress
 barred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What ever can have happened?" she said. "M. Vautrin said to M. Eugene,
 'Let us have an explanation!' then he took him by the arm, and there they
 are, out among the artichokes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin came in while she was speaking. "Mamma Vauquer," he said smiling,
 "don't frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my pistols under
 the lime-trees."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! monsieur," cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, "why do
 you want to kill M. Eugene?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! this is something fresh!" he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that
 brought the color into the poor girl's face. "That young fellow yonder is
 very nice, isn't he?" he went on. "You have given me a notion, my pretty
 child; I will make you both happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl away,
 as she said in her ear:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want any shots fired in my garden," said Mme. Vauquer. "You will
 frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a moment."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer," answered Vautrin. "There, there; it's
 all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man's
 arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put a
 bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five paces,"
 he said, "that won't take away your appetite, I suppose? You look to me to
 be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and as if you would
 rush on your death like a blockhead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you draw back?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't try to raise my temperature," answered Vautrin, "it is not cold
 this morning. Let us go and sit over there," he added, pointing to the
 green-painted garden seats; "no one can overhear us. I want a little talk
 with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no quarrel with
 you. I like you, take Trump?(confound it!)?take Vautrin's word
 for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you by-and-by. Meantime, I can
 tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you myself, as I will
 prove to you in a minute. Put down your bags," he continued, pointing to
 the round table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was consumed
 with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the man before
 him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange being who, a
 moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his protector.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now,"
 Vautrin went on. "You want to know too much, youngster. Come! come! keep
 cool! You will hear more astonishing things than that. I have had my
 misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn
 afterwards. Here is my past in three words. Who am I? Vautrin. What do I
 do? Just what I please. Let us change the subject. You want to know my
 character. I am good-natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those
 whose hearts speak to mine. These last may do anything they like with me;
 they may bruise my shins, and I shall not tell them to 'mind what they are
 about'; but, <i>nom d'une pipe</i>, the devil himself is not an uglier
 customer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don't happen to take to
 them; and you may just as well know at once that I think no more of
 killing a man than of that," and he spat before him as he spoke. "Only
 when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him
 properly. I am what you call an artist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini's <i>Memoirs</i>,
 such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian: A fine-spirited fellow
 he was! From him I learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who
 strikes us down at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and
 wherever it is found. And, setting other questions aside, is it not a
 glorious part to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck
 is on your side? I have thought a good deal about the constitution of your
 present social Dis-order. A duel is downright childish, my boy! utter
 nonsense and folly! When one of two living men must be got out of the way,
 none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a
 duel it is a toss-up?heads or tails?and there you are! Now I,
 for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five times running,
 send one bullet after another through the same hole, and at thirty-five
 paces, moreover! With that little accomplishment you might think yourself
 certain of killing your man, mightn't you. Well, I have fired, at twenty
 paces, and missed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his
 life?look here!"?(he unbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his
 chest, covered, like a bear's back, with a shaggy fell; the student gave a
 startled shudder)?"he was a raw lad, but he made his mark on me,"
 the extraordinary man went on, drawing Rastignac's fingers over a deep
 scar on his breast. "But that happened when I myself was a mere boy; I was
 one-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left?in a
 woman's love, and in a pack of rubbish that you will be over head and ears
 in directly. You and I were to have fought just now, weren't we? You might
 have killed me. Suppose that I were put under the earth, where would you
 be? You would have to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa's
 purse?and he has none too much in it as it is. I mean to open your
 eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do
 it from the point of view of a man who, after studying the world very
 closely, sees that there are but two alternatives?stupid obedience
 or revolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how much you
 will want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly, too, or that
 little head of ours will be swaying to and fro in the drag-nets at
 Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a
 Supreme Being. I will put you in the way of that million."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha! you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! At the mention of the
 million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, 'I will come
 for you this evening!' and she betakes herself to her toilette as a cat
 licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. All right. Come, now, let us go
 into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you know. We have a
 papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters (aged eighteen and
 seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other ten), that is
 about the roll-call of the crew. The aunt brings up the two sisters; the
 cure comes and teaches the boys Latin. Boiled chestnuts are oftener on the
 table than white bread. Papa makes a suit of clothes last a long while; if
 mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it is about as much as she
 has; the sisters manage as best they can. I know all about it; I have
 lived in the south.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a
 year, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all
 told. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must keep
 up appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the
 Beauseants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich, and
 we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer's messes, and we like grand
 dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a truckle-bed, and
 dream of a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting these things. What sort
 of men do the women run after? Men of ambition. Men of ambition have
 stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are warmer
 than those of ordinary men. Women feel that when their power is greatest,
 they look their best, and that those are their happiest hours; they like
 power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a power that may be
 their own destruction. I am going to make an inventory of your desires in
 order to put the question at issue before you. Here it is:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are sharp;
 what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? In the first place, we have the
 Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none the wiser for it,
 but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean to make an advocate of
 ourselves with a prospect of one day being made President of a Court of
 Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our betters, to the galleys with a
 T.F.[*] on their shoulders, so that the rich may be convinced that they
 can sleep in peace. There is no fun in that; and you are a long while
 coming to it; for, to begin with, there are two years of nauseous drudgery
 in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for out of our reach. It
 is tiresome to want things and never to have them. If you were a pallid
 creature of the mollusk order, you would have nothing to fear, but it is
 different when you have the hot blood of a lion and are ready to get into
 a score of scrapes every day of your life. This is the ghastliest form of
 torture known in this inferno of God's making, and you will give in to it.
 Or suppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and
 bemoan your hard lot; you, with your generous nature, will endure
 hardships that would drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long
 waiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of a place where the
 Government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps that
 are thrown to the butcher's dog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the
 rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is your work! Many thanks!
 If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. At
 thirty you will be a Justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you
 have not flung off the gown for good before then). By the time you are
 forty you may look to marry a miller's daughter, an heiress with some six
 thousand livres a year. Much obliged! If you have influence, you may
 possibly be a Public Prosecutor by the time you are thirty; with a salary
 of a thousand crowns, you could look to marry the mayor's daughter. Some
 petty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villele for Manuel in
 a bulletin (the names rhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and you
 will probably be a Procureur General by the time you are forty, with a
 chance of becoming a deputy. Please to observe, my dear boy, that our
 conscience will have been a little damaged in the process, and that we
 shall endure twenty years of drudgery and hidden poverty, and that our
 sisters are wearing Dian's livery. I have the honor to call your attention
 to another fact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Generaux at
 a time in all France, while there are some twenty thousand of you young
 men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks
 among you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg
 higher. If this sort of thing sickens you, try another course. The Baron
 de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? There's a nice
 prospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away. You are obliged to
 live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you must have a library of
 law books, live in chambers, go into society, go down on your knees to ask
 a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off the floor of the Palais de
 Justice. If this kind of business led to anything, I should not say no;
 but just give me the names of five advocates here in Paris who by the time
 that they are fifty are making fifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would
 sooner turn pirate on the high seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me
 like that. How will you find the capital? There is but one way, marry a
 woman who has money. There is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You
 hang a stone around your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of
 our exalted notions of honor and so forth? You might as well fly in the
 face of social conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent
 before your wife, to lick her mother's feet, to descend to dirty actions
 that would sicken swine?faugh!?never mind if you at least make
 your fortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if you marry for
 money. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with your
 wife. You are at the crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose your
 way.

 "But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin of
 Beauseant, and you have had an inkling of luxury; you have been to Mme. de
 Restaud's house, and in Father Goriot's daughter you have seen a glimpse
 of the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came back with a word
 written on your forehead. I knew it, I could read it?'<i>Success</i>!'
 Yes, success at any price. 'Bravo,' said I to myself, 'here is the sort of
 fellow for me.' You wanted money. Where was it all to come from? You have
 drained your sisters' little hoard (all brothers sponge more or less on
 their sisters). Those fifteen hundred francs of yours (got together, God
 knows how! in a country where there are more chestnuts than five-franc
 pieces) will slip away like soldiers after pillage. And, then, what will
 you do? Shall you begin to work? Work, or what you understand by work at
 this moment, means, for a man of Poiret's calibre, an old age in Mamma
 Vauquer's lodging-house. There are fifty thousand young men in your
 position at this moment, all bent as you are on solving one and the same
 problem?how to acquire a fortune rapidly. You are but a unit in that
 aggregate. You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how
 desperate the struggle is. There are not fifty thousand good positions for
 you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot. Do you
 know how a man makes his way here? By brilliant genius or by skilful
 corruption. You must either cut your way through these masses of men like
 a cannon ball, or steal among them like a plague. Honesty is nothing to
 the purpose. Men bow before the power of genius; they hate it, and try to
 slander it, because genius does not divide the spoil; but if genius
 persists, they bow before it. To sum it all up in a phrase, if they fail
 to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their knees and worship it.
 Corruption is a great power in the world, and talent is scarce. So
 corruption is the weapon of superfluous mediocrity; you will be made to
 feel the point of it everywhere. You will see women who spend more than
 ten thousand francs a year on dress, while their husband's salary (his
 whole income) is six thousand francs. You will see officials buying
 estates on twelve thousand francs a year. You will see women who sell
 themselves body and soul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a
 peer of France, who has a right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp.
 You have seen that poor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with
 his daughter's name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty
 thousand francs a year. I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in
 Paris without stumbling on some infernal complication. I'll bet my head to
 a head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet's nest by taking a
 fancy to the first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. They are all
 dodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to
 begin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed
 up in it, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive them to do
 for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to an
 end. So an honest man is the common enemy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man is
 the man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder. I am
 not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the world
 without a reward for their toil?God Almighty's outcasts, I call
 them. Among them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its
 stupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. At this moment, I think I
 see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical
 joke on them and stayed away at the Last Judgment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be
 rich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. It is no use
 playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is all up
 with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you, there are
 ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them thieves. You
 can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is no cleaner than a
 kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to cook your dinner, you
 must expect to soil your hands; the real art is in getting them clean
 again, and therein lies the whole morality of our epoch. If I take this
 tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the right to do so; I know it
 well. Do you think that I am blaming it? Far from it; the world has always
 been as it is now. Moralists' strictures will never change it. Mankind are
 not perfect, but one age is more or less hypocritical than another, and
 then simpletons say that its morality is high or low. I do not think that
 the rich are any worse than the poor; man is much the same, high or low,
 or wherever he is. In a million of these human cattle there may be half a
 score of bold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of
 them. And you, if you are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to
 your end, and hold your head high. But you must lay your account with envy
 and slander and mediocrity, and every man's hand will be against you.
 Napoleon met with a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him
 to the colonies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning,
 strengthened in yesterday's purpose. In that case I will make you an offer
 that no one would decline. Listen attentively. You see, I have an idea of
 my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate, say a
 hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of America. I
 mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug millions by
 selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an absolute
 monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no one here in
 these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. I am a great poet; I
 do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. At this moment I have
 fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty negroes. I want two
 hundred thousand francs, because I want to have two hundred negroes to
 carry out my notions of the patriarachal life properly. Negroes, you see,
 are like a sort of family ready grown, and there are no inquisitive public
 prosecutors out there to interfere with you. That investment in ebony
 ought to mean three or four million francs in ten years' time. If I am
 successful, no one will ask me who I am. I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an
 American citizen. I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty
 still; I shall enjoy life after my own fashion. In two words, if I find
 you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred thousand
 francs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is that too much? Your little wife
 will be very much in love with you. Once married, you will show signs of
 uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you will be depressed. Then,
 some night after sundry grimacings, comes the confession, between two
 kisses, 'Two hundred thousand francs of debts, my darling!' This sort of
 farce is played every day in Paris, and by young men of the highest
 fashion. When a young wife has given her heart, she will not refuse her
 purse. Perhaps you are thinking that you will lose the money for good? Not
 you. You will make two hundred thousand francs again by some stroke of
 business. With your capital and your brains you should be able to
 accumulate as large a fortune as you could wish. <i>Ergo</i>, in six
 months you will have made your own fortune, and our old friend Vautrin's,
 and made an amiable woman very happy, to say nothing of your people at
 home, who must blow on their fingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack
 of firewood. You need not be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I
 make. Forty-seven out of every sixty great matches here in Paris are made
 after just such a bargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my
 gentleman to??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What must I do?" said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin's speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Next to nothing," returned the other, with a slight involuntary movement,
 the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite at the end of
 his line. "Follow me carefully! The heart of a girl whose life is wretched
 and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb love; a dry sponge that
 swells at the first drop of sentiment. If you pay court to a young girl
 whose existence is a compound of loneliness, despair, and poverty, and who
 has no suspicion that she will come into a fortune, good Lord! it is quint
 and quatorze at piquet; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery
 before-hand; it is speculating in the funds when you have news from a sure
 source; it is building up a marriage on an indestructible foundation. The
 girl may come in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so
 many pebbles, at your feet. 'Take it, my beloved! Take it, Alfred,
 Adolphe, Eugene!' or whoever it was that showed his sense by sacrificing
 himself for her. And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I understand
 it. You sell a coat that is getting shabby, so that you can take her to
 the <i>Cadran bleu</i>, treat her to mushrooms on toast, and then go to
 the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl.
 I need not remind you of the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down
 so well with all women; you spill a few drops of water on your stationery,
 for instance; those are the tears you shed while far away from her. You
 look to me as if you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the
 heart. Paris, you see, is like a forest in the New World, where you have
 to deal with a score of varieties of savages?Illinois and Hurons,
 who live on the proceed of their social hunting. You are a hunter of
 millions; you set your snares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways
 of hunting. Some hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet
 others sell their clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back
 from the chase with his game-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in
 good society. In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must be
 said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great
 cities. If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse admittance
 among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris stretches out a
 hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and hobnobs with his
 infamy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where is such a girl to be found?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Under your eyes; she is yours already."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mlle. Victorine?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Precisely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what was that you said?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She has not a penny," Eugene continued, much mystified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will all be
 clear enough. Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said that
 he murdered one of his friends at the time of the Revolution. He is one of
 your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. He is a banker?senior
 partner in the house of Frederic Taillefer and Company. He has one son,
 and means to leave all he has to the boy, to the prejudice of Victorine.
 For my part, I don't like to see injustice of this sort. I am like Don
 Quixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak against the strong. If it
 should please God to take that youth away from him, Taillefer would have
 only his daughter left; he would want to leave his money to some one or
 other; an absurd notion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely
 to have any more children, as I know. Victorine is gentle and amiable; she
 will soon twist her father round her fingers, and set his head spinning
 like a German top by plying him with sentiment! She will be too much
 touched by your devotion to forget you; you will marry her. I mean to play
 Providence for you, and Providence is to do my will. I have a friend whom
 I have attached closely to myself, a colonel in the Army of the Loire, who
 has just been transferred into the <i>garde royale</i>. He has taken my
 advice and turned ultra-royalist; he is not one of those fools who never
 change their opinions. Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would give
 you this?don't stick to your opinions any more than to your words.
 If any one asks you for them, let him have them?at a price. A man
 who prides himself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot
 who believes in infallibility. There are no such things as principles;
 there are only events, and there are no laws but those of expediency: a
 man of talent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds
 himself, and turns everything to his own ends. If laws and principles were
 fixed and invariable, nations would not change them as readily as we
 change our shirts. The individual is not obliged to be more particular
 than the nation. A man whose services to France have been of the very
 slightest is a fetich looked on with superstitious awe because he has
 always seen everything in red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into
 the Museum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled
 La Fayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who
 despises humanity so much that he spits as many oaths as he is asked for
 in the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces at the
 Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling mud
 at him. Oh! I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I have the
 secrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in agreement as to
 the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable opinion?I
 shall have to wait a long while first. In the Tribunals you will not find
 three judges of the same opinion on a single point of law. To return to
 the man I was telling you of. He would crucify Jesus Christ again, if I
 bade him. At a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with
 a scamp that will not send so much as five francs to his sister, poor
 girl, and" (here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing-master
 about to lunge)?"turn him off into the dark!" he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How frightful!" said Eugene. "You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin, you
 are joking!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There! there! Keep cool!" said the other. "Don't behave like a baby. But
 if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that I am a
 scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a blackleg nor
 a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it is quite natural
 at your age. I was like that myself once. Only remember this, you will do
 worse things yourself some day. You will flirt with some pretty woman and
 take her money. You have thought of that, of course," said Vautrin, "for
 how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution? There are
 no two ways about virtue, my dear student; it either is, or it is not.
 Talk of doing penance for your sins! It is a nice system of business, when
 you pay for your crime by an act of contrition! You seduce a woman that
 you may set your foot on such and such a rung of the social ladder; you
 sow dissension among the children of a family; you descend, in short, to
 every base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain your
 own ends for your own pleasure or your profit; and can you imagine that
 these are acts of faith, hope, or charity? How is it that a dandy, who in
 a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets only a couple of months
 in prison; while a poor devil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs,
 with aggravating circumstances, is condemned to penal servitude? Those are
 your laws. Not a single provision but lands you in some absurdity. That
 man with yellow gloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds
 no blood, but he drains his victim's veins as surely; a desperado forces
 open a door with a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! You yourself will do
 every one of those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed.
 Do you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? Despise
 mankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in the net of
 the Code. The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to
 account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly
 executed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At this
 moment my sentiments are all my science."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so weak-minded,"
 said Vautrin, "I shall say no more about it. One last word, however," and
 he looked hard at the student?"you have my secret," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else
 might not be so scrupulous, you see. Keep in mind what I want to do for
 you. I will give you a fortnight. The offer is still open."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a head of iron the man has!" said Eugene to himself, as he watched
 Vautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. "Yet Mme. de
 Beauseant said as much more gracefully; he has only stated the case in
 cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws of steel. What made me
 think of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed my motives before I knew
 them myself. To sum it up, that outlaw has told me more about virtue than
 all I have learned from men and books. If virtue admits of no compromises,
 I have certainly robbed my sisters," he said, throwing down the bags on
 the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep
 thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw! every
 one believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? Nations have made an idol of
 Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free? My youth is
 still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to obtain wealth or
 power, does it mean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and
 cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? To consent to be the
 servant of others who have likewise fawned, and lied, and flattered? Must
 I cringe to them before I can hope to be their accomplice? Well, then, I
 decline. I mean to work nobly and with a single heart. I will work day and
 night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions. It may be
 the slowest of all roads to success, but I shall lay my head on the pillow
 at night untroubled by evil thoughts. Is there a greater thing than this?to
 look back over your life and know that it is stainless as a lily? I and my
 life are like a young man and his betrothed. Vautrin has put before me all
 that comes after ten years of marriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I
 do not want to think at all; the heart is a sure guide."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie, who
 announced that the tailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his
 appearance before the man with the two money bags, and was not ill pleased
 that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he put on his
 new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am quite equal to M. de Trailles," he said to himself. "In short, I
 look like a gentleman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes,"
 Father Goriot's voice spoke from the doorway of Eugene's room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano's ball on
 Monday. If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether my
 two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all about it
 in fact."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How did you find that out, my good Goriot?" said Eugene, putting a chair
 by the fire for his visitor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Therese and
 Constance," he added gleefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made happy
 by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him information of
 his lady-love without her knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>You</i> will see them both!" he said, giving artless expression to a
 pang of jealousy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not know," answered Eugene. "I will go to Mme. de Beauseant and ask
 her for an introduction to the Marechale."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the
 Vicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. The "abysses of
 the human heart," in the moralists' phrase, are only insidious thoughts,
 involuntary promptings of personal interest. The instinct of enjoyment
 turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose which have furnished the
 text for so much rhetoric are calculations prompted by the hope of
 pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and impeccable as to
 gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions. Youth, moreover, when
 bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to behold himself in the mirror of
 consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and therein lies the whole
 difference between these two phases of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had been
 growing up for several days past. This secret friendship and the antipathy
 that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose from the same
 psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall investigate the
 effects of mental action upon the physical world will doubtless find more
 than one proof of the material nature of our sentiments in other animals.
 What physiognomist is as quick to discern character as a dog is to
 discover from a stranger's face whether this is a friend or no? Those
 by-words?"atoms," "affinities"?are facts surviving in modern
 languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres who amuse themselves
 by winnowing the chaff of language to find its grammatical roots. We <i>feel</i>
 that we are loved. Our sentiments make themselves felt in everything, even
 at a great distance. A letter is a living soul, and so faithful an echo of
 the voice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one
 of love's most precious treasures. Father Goriot's affection was of the
 instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a sublime pitch; he had
 scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and youthful
 sympathy in the student's heart. This friendship had, however, scarcely
 reached the stage at which confidences are made. Though Eugene had spoken
 of his wish to meet Mme. de Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the
 old man to introduce him to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity
 might stand him in good stead. All that Father Goriot had said as yet
 about his daughters had referred to the remarks that the student had made
 so freely in public on that day of the two visits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for mentioning
 my name?" he had said on the day following that scene at dinner. "My
 daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but my sons-in-law
 have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble between my darlings
 and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters secretly. Fathers who can
 see their daughters at any time have no idea of all the pleasure that all
 this mystery gives me; I cannot always see mine when I wish, do you
 understand? So when it is fine I walk out in the Champs-Elysees, after
 finding out from their waiting-maids whether my daughters mean to go out.
 I wait near the entrance; my heart beats fast when the carriages begin to
 come; I admire them in their dresses, and as they pass they give me a
 little smile, and it seems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray
 of bright sunlight. I wait, for they always go back the same way, and then
 I see them again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into
 their cheeks; all about me people say, 'What a beautiful woman that is!'
 and it does my heart good to hear them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw
 them; I envy the little lap-dog on their knees. Their happiness is my
 life. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any
 harm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my own
 way. Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening when
 they are going out to a ball? And what a disappointment it is when I get
 there too late, and am told that 'Madame has gone out!' Once I waited till
 three o'clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her for two whole
 days. I was so pleased, that it was almost too much for me! Please do not
 speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters are to me. They are
 always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will not have it. 'Just
 keep your money,' I tell them. 'What should I do with it? I want nothing.'
 And what am I, sir, after all? An old carcase, whose soul is always where
 my daughters are. When you have seen Mme. de Nucingen, tell me which you
 like the most," said the old man after a moment's pause, while Eugene put
 the last touches to his toilette. The student was about to go out to walk
 in the Garden of the Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to
 appear in Mme. de Beauseant's drawing-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That walk was a turning-point in Eugene's career. Several women noticed
 him; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed. This almost
 admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. He forgot his sisters
 and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer remembered his
 own virtuous scruples. He had seen hovering above his head the fiend so
 easy to mistake for an angel, the Devil with rainbow wings, who scatters
 rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts, who invests women
 with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the eyes of fools till
 they forget the simple origins of royal dominion; he had heard the rustle
 of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the symbol of power. However
 cynical Vautrin's words had been, they had made an impression on his mind,
 as the sordid features of the old crone who whispers, "A lover, and gold
 in torrents," remain engraven on a young girl's memory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o'clock, then he
 went to Mme. de Beauseant, and received one of the terrible blows against
 which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the Vicomtesse had received
 him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is the result
 of fine breeding, but is only complete when it comes from the heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To-day Mme. de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this moment.
 I am engaged..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the
 whole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the
 tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He caught a glimpse of the
 iron hand beneath the velvet glove?the personality, the egoism
 beneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short, he heard that
 unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed canopy of the throne,
 and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he could
 not believe in her haughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had
 subscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind the
 benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond, between
 two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. The kindness which knits
 two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little understood as the
 passion of love, for both love and kindness are the lavish generosity of
 noble natures. Rastignac was set upon going to the Duchesse de
 Carigliano's ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," he faltered out, "I would not have come to trouble you about a
 trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can wait."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, come and dine with me," she said, a little confused by the
 harsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely
 kind-hearted as she was high-born.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said to
 himself as he went away, "Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind of
 treatment. What must the rest of the world be like when one of the kindest
 of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment, and
 tosses me aside like an old shoe? So it is every one for himself? It is
 true that her house is not a shop, and I have put myself in the wrong by
 needing her help. You should cut your way through the world like a cannon
 ball, as Vautrin said."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the student's bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure
 which he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate seemed
 to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should combine to
 urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the Maison Vauquer
 had described as a field of battle where you must either slay or be slain,
 and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave your conscience and your heart
 at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering into this game of grim
 earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta, you must snatch your prize without
 being detected if you would deserve the crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had
 always been to him. They went together to the dining-room, where the
 Vicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the Restoration the
 luxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest degree,
 and M. de Beauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few pleasures
 left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he was a gourmand
 of the schools of Louis XVIII. and of the Duc d'Escars, and luxury was
 supplemented by splendor. Eugene, dining for the first time in a house
 where the traditions of grandeur had descended through many generations,
 had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his eyes. In the time
 of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper, because the officers
 who took part in them must be fortified for immediate service, and even in
 Paris might be called upon to leave the ballroom for the battlefield. This
 arrangement had gone out of fashion under the Monarchy, and Eugene had so
 far only been asked to dances. The self-possession which pre-eminently
 distinguished him in later life already stood him in good stead, and he
 did not betray his amazement. Yet as he saw for the first time the finely
 wrought silver plate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous
 dinner, noiselessly served, it was difficult for such an ardent
 imagination not to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the
 hardships of the life which he had chosen only that morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a
 feeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he
 would go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner
 surroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he seemed
 to feel on his shoulder at that moment. When you consider the numberless
 forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris, common-sense
 begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the State to establish
 great colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in the capital;
 how it is that pretty women are respected, or that the gold coin displayed
 in the money-changer's wooden saucers does not take to itself wings in the
 twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think further, how comparatively
 few cases of crime there are, and to count up the misdemeanors committed
 by youth, is there not a certain amount of respect due to these patient
 Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and nearly always come off
 victorious? The struggles of the poor student in Paris, if skilfully
 drawn, would furnish a most dramatic picture of modern civilization.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In vain Mme. de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak; the
 student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte's presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?" the Vicomtesse
 asked her husband.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure," he answered, and
 there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugene did not detect,
 "but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His mistress," said she to herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?" inquired the Vicomte.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she answered, petulantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de
 Rastignac."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That would be a very compromising step for you," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,' to quote M.
 de Chateaubriand," said Rastignac, with a bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauseant in a brougham,
 that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a fashionable theatre.
 It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly transported him into a
 box facing the stage. All the lorgnettes of the house were pointed at him
 as he entered, and at the Vicomtesse in her charming toilette. He went
 from enchantment to enchantment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must talk to me, you know," said Mme. de Beauseant. "Ah! look! There
 is Mme. de Nucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and M. de
 Trailles are on the other side."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de Rochefide
 should have been; M. d'Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de Beauseant's face
 lighted up in a marvelous way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is charming," said Eugene, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She has white eyelashes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Her hands are large."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such beautiful eyes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Her face is long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but length gives distinction."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just see
 how she fidgets with her opera-glass! The Goriot blood shows itself in
 every movement," said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene's astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Indeed, Mme. de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of the
 house, and to be unconscious of Mme. Nucingen's existence; but no movement
 made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. The house was full of the
 loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was not a little
 flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme. de Beauseant's young,
 handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to have no eyes for any one
 else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de
 Rastignac. You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one's head
 like that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear cousin," said Eugene, "you have protected me indeed so far, and
 now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor which will
 cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. I have lost my
 heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Already!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And to that woman!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?" he asked, with
 a keen glance at his cousin. "Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano is a
 friend of the Duchesse de Berri," he went on, after a pause; "you are sure
 to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to take me to
 her ball on Monday? I shall meet Mme. de Nucingen there, and enter into my
 first skirmish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Willingly," she said. "If you have a liking for her already, your affairs
 of the heart are like to prosper. That is de Marsay over there in the
 Princesse Galathionne's box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked with jealousy.
 There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially if she happens
 to be a banker's wife. All those ladies of the Chaussee-d'Antin love
 revenge."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should suffer in silence."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this point the Marquis d'Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauseant's box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you," he said, "and I am
 telling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse's face, and knew that this
 was love, and learned the difference between love and the affectations of
 Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute, and yielded his place
 to M. d'Ajuda with a sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!" he said to
 himself. "And <i>he</i> could forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any
 one forsake her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a boy's passionate indignation in his heart. He could have flung
 himself at Mme. de Beauseant's feet; he longed for the power of the devil
 if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an eagle
 snatches up some white yearling from the plains and bears it to its eyrie.
 It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery of fair
 pictures he had not one picture of his own. "To have a mistress and an
 almost royal position is a sign of power," he said to himself. And he
 looked at Mme. de Nucingen as a man measures another who has insulted him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him a
 thousand times for his discretion. The first act came to an end just then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to
 her?" she asked of the Marquis d'Ajuda.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She will be delighted," said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese rose as
 he spoke and took the student's arm, and in another moment Eugene found
 himself in Mme. de Nucingen's box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," said the Marquis, "I have the honor of presenting to you the
 Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's. You
 have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would fill up
 the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his divinity."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Words spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful import;
 but such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives offence to a
 woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugene the place which her
 husband had just left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur," she
 said. "Those who are so fortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauseant's company
 do not desire to leave it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," Eugene said, lowering his voice, "I think that to please my
 cousin I should remain with you. Before my lord Marquis came we were
 speaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance," he
 added aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 M. d'Ajuda turned and left them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?" asked the Baroness.
 "Then we shall make each other's acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me
 about you, and has made me anxious to meet you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your
 indulgence before confiding such a secret to you. I am your father's
 neighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his daughter. I was rash
 enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your sister and
 her husband very much. You cannot think how severely the Duchesse de
 Langeais and my cousin blamed this apostasy on a daughter's part, as a
 piece of bad taste. I told them all about it, and they both burst out
 laughing. Then Mme. de Beauseant made some comparison between you and your
 sister, speaking in high terms of you, and saying how very fond you were
 of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And, indeed, how could you help loving him? He
 adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. We talked about you
 this morning for two hours. So this evening I was quite full of all that
 your father had told me, and while I was dining with my cousin I said that
 you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme. de Beauseant meant to
 gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here, telling
 me, in her gracious way, that I should see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur," said the
 banker's wife. "We shall be quite old friends in a little while."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary friendship,"
 said Rastignac; "I should never wish to be your friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess an
 unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly; for a
 young man's tone, glance and attitude give a surpassing eloquence to the
 banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable. Then,
 woman-like, being at a loss how to reply to the student's outspoken
 admiration, she answered a previous remark.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she does,"
 she said; "he has been a Providence to us. It was not until M. de Nucingen
 positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings that I yielded
 the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long while; I have shed
 many tears over it. This violence to my feelings, with my husband's brutal
 treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy married life. There is
 certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable than mine, and
 yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied. You will think I
 must be out of my senses to talk to you like this; but you know my father,
 and I cannot regard you as a stranger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will find no one," said Eugene, "who longs as eagerly as I do to be
 yours. What do all women seek? Happiness." (He answered his own question
 in low, vibrating tones.) "And if happiness for a woman means that she is
 to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her
 wishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare her
 heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her gracious virtues, without
 fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that never
 fails can only be found in the heart of a young man who, at a bare sign
 from you, would go to his death, who neither knows nor cares to know
 anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to him. I
 myself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come from a
 remote country district; I am quite new to this world of Paris; I have
 only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that here I
 should find no love. Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to see my
 cousin's heart from very near; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures
 of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all women, until the
 day comes when I find <i>the</i> woman to whom I may devote myself. As
 soon as I saw you, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt
 myself borne towards you as if by the current of a stream. I had so often
 thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so
 beautiful! Mme. de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at you.
 She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor see how
 soft your eyes are.... I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but let me
 talk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words as
 these; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought not to
 reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to pour out his
 story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and Mme. de
 Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who still sat
 in the Princesse Galathionne's box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take her
 home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," Eugene said, "I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you
 before the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Matame infites you to come," said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian, with
 indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance, "you are
 quide sure of being well receifed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My affairs seem to be in a promising way," said Eugene to himself.?
 "'Can you love me?' I asked her, and she did not resent it. "The bit is in
 the horse's mouth, and I have only to mount and ride;" and with that he
 went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauseant, who was leaving the theatre
 on d'Ajuda's arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student did not know that the Baroness' thoughts had been wandering;
 that she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those
 letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so, happy in his
 delusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people
 were waiting till their carriages were announced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man," said the
 Portuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken leave of
 them. "He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel; he will go a
 long way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out a woman for
 him, as you did, just when she needed consolation?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless lover,"
 said Mme. de Beauseant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue
 Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went. He
 had noticed how closely Mme. de Restaud had scrutinized him when he sat
 beside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess' doors would not
 be closed in the future. Four important houses were now open to him?for
 he meant to stand well with the Marechale; he had four supporters in the
 inmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it was clear to him that, once
 involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself to a
 spoke of the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he would not
 examine himself too curiously as to the methods, but he was certain of the
 end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his hold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to
 manage her husband. That husband of hers is a great speculator; he might
 put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was not
 sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its
 possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor. These
 were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they
 were less cynical than Vautrin's notions; but if they had been tried in
 the crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have issued from the
 test. It is by a succession of such like transactions that men sink at
 last to the level of the relaxed morality of this epoch, when there have
 never been so few of those who square their courses with their theories,
 so few of those noble characters who do not yield to temptation, for whom
 the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. To these
 magnificent types of uncompromising Right we owe two masterpieces?the
 Alceste of Moliere, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans
 and her father in Sir Walter Scott's novel. Perhaps a work which should
 chronicle the opposite course, which should trace out all the devious
 courses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags his
 conscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end and yet
 save appearances, such a chronicle would be no less edifying and no less
 dramatic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed to
 see her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled the
 intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate silken
 tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could
 see the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell over
 him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated his imagination by
 sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He knocked unceremoniously at
 Goriot's door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor," said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At the Italiens."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did she enjoy it?.... Just come inside," and the old man left his bed,
 unlocked the door, and promptly returned again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot's room, and he
 could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast between the den
 in which the father lived and the costume of the daughter whom he had just
 beheld. The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in places the
 varnished wall-paper had come away and gave glimpses of the grimy yellow
 plaster beneath. The wretched bed on which the old man lay boasted but one
 thin blanket, and a wadded quilt made out of large pieces of Mme.
 Vauquer's old dresses. The floor was damp and gritty. Opposite the window
 stood a chest of drawers made of rosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind
 with a curving front and brass handles, shaped like rings of twisted vine
 stems covered with flowers and leaves. On a venerable piece of furniture
 with a wooden shelf stood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. A pair
 of shoes stood in one corner; a night-table by the bed had neither a door
 nor marble slab. There was not a trace of a fire in the empty grate; the
 square walnut table with the crossbar against which Father Goriot had
 crushed and twisted his posset-dish stood near the hearth. The old man's
 hat was lying on a broken-down bureau. An armchair stuffed with straw and
 a couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From the
 tester of the bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of
 some cheap material in large red and black checks. No poor drudge in a
 garret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Mme. Vauquer's
 lodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and a
 sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a prison. Luckily,
 Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on Eugene
 as the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. The old man turned
 round, keeping the bedclothes huddled up to his chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he said, "and which do you like the best, Mme. de Restaud or Mme.
 de Nucingen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I like Mme. Delphine the best," said the law student, "because she loves
 you the best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the words so heartily spoken the old man's hand slipped out from under
 the bedclothes and grasped Eugene's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, thank you," he said, gratefully. "Then what did she say about
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student repeated the Baroness' remarks with some embellishments of his
 own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice from
 Heaven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear child!" he said. "Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must not
 believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. The two sisters are
 jealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection. Mme. de
 Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees his children
 as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of their hearts; he
 knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. Oh! if I only had
 good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare say there is no
 perfect happiness here below. If I might live with them?simply hear
 their voices, know that they are there, see them go and come as I used to
 do at home when they were still with me; why, my heart bounds at the
 thought.... Were they nicely dressed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Eugene. "But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have
 such fine houses, while you live in such a den as this?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear me, why should I want anything better?" he replied, with seeming
 carelessness. "I can't quite explain to you how it is; I am not used to
 stringing words together properly, but it all lies there??" he
 said, tapping his heart. "My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so
 long as they are happy, and smartly dressed, and have soft carpets under
 their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down of
 a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall never
 feel dull if they are laughing. I have no troubles but theirs. When you,
 too, are a father, and you hear your children's little voices, you will
 say to yourself, 'That has all come from me.' You will feel that those
 little ones are akin to every drop in your veins, that they are the very
 flower of your life (and what else are they?); you will cleave so closely
 to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make. Everywhere I
 hear their voices sounding in my ears. If they are sad, the look in their
 eyes freezes my blood. Some day you will find out that there is far more
 happiness in another's happiness than in your own. It is something that I
 cannot explain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through
 you. In short, I live my life three times over. Shall I tell you something
 funny? Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to understand
 God. He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world comes from
 Him. And it is just the same with my children, monsieur. Only, I love my
 daughters better than God loves the world, for the world is not so
 beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more beautiful than I am.
 Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would
 see them this evening. Great Heaven! If any man would make my little
 Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved, I would black his boots
 and run on his errands. That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all
 about him from her maid. A longing to wring his neck comes over me now and
 then. He does not love her! does not love a pearl of a woman, with a voice
 like a nightingale and shaped like a model. Where can her eyes have been
 when she married that great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them
 to have married young men, good-looking and good-tempered?but, after
 all, they had their own way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot was sublime. Eugene had never yet seen his face light up as
 it did now with the passionate fervor of a father's love. It is worthy of
 remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive power; the
 roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection,
 communicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the
 voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a change in the very
 features of the speaker; for under the inspiration of passion the
 stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas, if not of
 language, and seems to move in some sphere of light. In the old man's
 tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell that a
 great actor exerts over his audience. But does not the poet in us find
 expression in our affections?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Eugene, "perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is
 pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. That sprig of fashion has
 left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I fell in love with
 Mme. Delphine this evening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stuff!" said Father Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole hour
 we talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the day
 after to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! how I should love you, if she should like you. You are kind-hearted;
 you would never make her miserable. If you were to forsake her, I would
 cut your throat at once. A woman does not love twice, you see! Good
 heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene! It is cold; you ought not
 to stay here. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> so you have heard her speak? What message
 did she give you for me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None at all," said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, "She told me to
 tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have mine
 already made for me by that message from her. May God grant you all your
 desires! You have come in like a good angel on me to-night, and brought
 with you the air that my daughter breathes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor old fellow!" said Eugene as he lay down. "It is enough to melt a
 heart of stone. His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand
 Turk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend, a
 confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was established
 between the two the only relationship that could attach this old man to
 another man. The passions never miscalculate. Father Goriot felt that this
 friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine; he thought that he
 should find a warmer welcome for himself if the Baroness should care for
 Eugene. Moreover, he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man.
 Mme. de Nucingen, for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily,
 had never known the joys of love. Eugene was certainly (to make use of his
 own expression) one of the nicest young men that he had ever seen, and
 some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the
 happiness which had not been hers. These were the beginnings of a
 friendship that grew up between the old man and his neighbor; but for this
 friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he seated
 himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot's face, which as a rule, looked
 as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that passed between
 the two, surprised the other lodgers. Vautrin, who saw Eugene for the
 first time since their interview, seemed as if he would fain read the
 student's very soul. During the night Eugene had had some time in which to
 scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as he remembered
 yesterday's proposal, the thought of Mlle. Taillefer's dowry came, of
 course, to his mind, and he could not help thinking of Victorine as the
 most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. It chanced that their eyes
 met. The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugene looked very handsome in
 his new clothes. So much was said in the glance, thus exchanged, that
 Eugene could not doubt but that he was associated in her mind with the
 vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl's heart and gather round the first
 attractive newcomer. "Eight hundred thousand francs!" a voice cried in his
 ears, but suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening,
 thinking that his extemporized passion for Mme. de Nucingen was a talisman
 that would preserve him from this temptation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They gave Rossini's <i>Barber of Seville</i> at the Italiens yesterday
 evening," he remarked. "I never heard such delicious music. Good gracious!
 how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched him as
 a dog watches his master's slightest movement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You men are like fighting cocks," said Mme. Vauquer; "you do what you
 like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How did you get back?" inquired Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I walked," answered Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For my own part," remarked the tempter, "I do not care about doing things
 by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my
 carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably. Everything or
 nothing; that is my motto."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And a good one, too," commented Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day," said Eugene, addressing
 Goriot in an undertone. "She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure;
 she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. I have
 found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin
 Mme. de Beauseant; don't forget to tell her that I love her too well not
 to think of trying to arrange this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. He had no mind to stay a
 moment longer than was necessary in that odious house. He wasted his time
 that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that
 accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin's arguments had set him
 meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections when he
 happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What makes you look so solemn?" said the medical student, putting an arm
 through Eugene's as they went towards the Palais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am tormented by temptations."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What kind? There is a cure for temptation."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yielding to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You laugh, but you don't know what it is all about. Have you read
 Rousseau?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he
 could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere
 force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do it,
 and had only to give a nod. Would you do it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? Pshaw! after all,
 young or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it. ... Well,
 then. Hang it, no!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well
 enough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for
 dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two sisters
 as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be happy. How am I
 to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in the next five
 years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for heavy stakes, and
 it is no use wasting your luck on low play."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the
 outset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword. If
 that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or to the hulks
 you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot I mean
 to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I mean to step into my
 father's shoes and plod along. A man's affections are just as fully
 satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference.
 Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he could not have more
 mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins. Happiness, old man,
 depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your
 head; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis, the actual amount
 of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you, and is just exactly
 the same in any case. I am for letting that Chinaman live."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be friends."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say," remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a broad
 walk in the Jardin des Plantes, "I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few
 minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see in
 last year's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems to
 me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman.
 Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you why some time.
 Good-bye; it is nearly four o'clock, and I must be in to answer to my
 name."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting for
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here," cried the old man, "here is a letter from her. Pretty handwriting,
 eh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene broke the seal and read:?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sir,?I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian
 music. I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of
 accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on
 Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen
 and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite
 by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will
 be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties. Do not answer,
 but simply come.?Yours sincerely, D. DE N."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Let me see it," said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter. "You
 are going, aren't you?" he added, when he had smelled the writing-paper.
 "How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that is certain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A woman does not fling herself at a man's head in this way," the student
 was thinking. "She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay; nothing but
 pique makes a woman do a thing like this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Father Goriot, "what are you thinking about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those
 days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg
 Saint-Germain a banker's wife would go to almost any length. For the
 coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the women
 who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and among the
 greatest of these <i>Dames du Petit-Chateau</i>, as they were called, were
 Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the
 Duchesse de Maufrigneause. Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the
 frantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausee-d'Antin to enter
 this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their
 sex. But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead, and kept his
 judgment cool, and the not altogether enviable power of imposing instead
 of accepting conditions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am going," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she had
 treated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her
 feet. Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the hour when
 he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a young man in a
 first flirtation as there is in first love. The certainty of success is a
 source of happiness to which men do not confess, and all the charm of
 certain women lies in this. The desire of conquest springs no less from
 the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every passion is
 excited or sustained by one or the other of these two motives which divide
 the empire of love. Perhaps this division is one result of the great
 question of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social life. The
 melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while
 those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too
 stubborn resistance. In other words, the lymphatic temperament is
 essentially despondent, and the rhapsodic is bilious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little
 details that is grateful to a young man's self-love, though he will not
 own to it for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he arranged his
 hair, that a pretty woman's glances would wander through the dark curls.
 He indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance,
 and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the
 creases of his coat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are worse figures, that is certain," he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting
 down to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited
 by his elegant appearance. The amazement with which any attention to dress
 is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. No one can
 put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Clk! clk! clk!" cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue against
 the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France," said Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you going a-courting?" inquired Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" cried the artist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My compliments to my lady your wife," from the <i>employe</i> at the
 Museum.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your wife; have you a wife?" asked Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color, all
 prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the latest
 fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton, half-wool; a
 certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the
 Royal College of Physicians! children like it! a remedy for headache,
 indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the throat, eyes, and ears!"
 cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a
 fair. "And how much shall we say for this marvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No.
 Nothing of the sort. All that is left in stock after supplying the Great
 Mogul. All the crowned heads of Europe, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of
 Baden, have been anxious to get a sight of it. Walk up! walk up!
 gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you go in! Strike up the music there!
 Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum! boum! Mister Clarinette, there you
 are out of tune!" he added gruffly; "I will rap your knuckles for you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness! what an amusing man!" said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; "I
 should never feel dull with him in the house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This burlesque of Vautrin's was the signal for an outburst of merriment,
 and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle.
 Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in Mme. Couture's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The cab is at the door," announced Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where is he going to dine?" asked Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. Goriot's daughter," said the law student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at
 Eugene with something like envy in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those
 many-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns,
 which are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker's house,
 decorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco,
 the landings of marble mosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little
 drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion, and decorated
 like a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The effort that she made
 to hide her feelings aroused Eugene's interest; it was plain that she was
 not playing a part. He had expected a little flutter of excitement at his
 coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. The disappointment piqued his
 vanity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My claim to your confidence is very small, madame," he said, after
 rallying her on her abstracted mood; "but if I am in the way, please tell
 me so frankly; I count on your good faith."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, stay with me," she said; "I shall be all alone if you go. Nucingen is
 dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to be taken out of
 myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what is the matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are the very last person whom I should tell," she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps. Yet, no," she went on; "it is a domestic quarrel, which ought to
 be buried in the depths of the heart. I am very unhappy; did I not tell
 you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the heaviest of all
 fetters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the
 young man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs
 lying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene said, and he
 becomes a coxcomb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What can you have left to wish for?" he answered. "You are young,
 beautiful, beloved, and rich."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not let us talk of my affairs," she said shaking her head mournfully.
 "We will dine together <i>tete-a-tete</i>, and afterwards we will go to
 hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?" she went on, rising
 and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian designs in
 the most superb taste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish that you were altogether mine," said Eugene; "you are charming."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would have a forlorn piece of property," she said, smiling bitterly.
 "There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness; and yet, in spite
 of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my troubles have broken
 my night's rest; I shall grow ugly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! that is impossible," cried the law student; "but I am curious to know
 what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me," she said. "Your
 love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men use to
 masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven to
 despair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something else, for
 pity's sake," she added. "Let me show you my rooms."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; let us stay here," answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa before
 the fire, and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen's hand in his. She surrendered
 it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one of the
 spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Listen," said Rastignac; "if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me
 about it. I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone. You
 must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an end to
 them, even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men; or I shall go, never to
 return."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of
 despair, "I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. Yes," she
 said to herself, "I have no other resource left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rang the bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are the horses put in for the master?" she asked of the servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, madame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall take his carriage myself. He can have mine and my horses. Serve
 dinner at seven o'clock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, come with me," she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in the
 banker's carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the Palais-Royal," she said to the coachman; "stop near the
 Theatre-Francais."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable
 questions that Eugene put to her. He was at a loss what to think of her
 mute resistance, her obstinate silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Another moment and she will escape me," he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a
 glance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it true that you love me?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the
 uneasiness that he felt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you ready to do my bidding?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blindly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you ever been to a gaming-house?" she asked in a tremulous voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse," she said.
 "Take it! there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate
 woman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the gaming-houses?I
 do not know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. Try
 your luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose it
 all or bring me back six thousand francs. I will tell you about my
 troubles when you come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Devil take me, I'm sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am
 about, but I will obey you," he added, with inward exultation, as he
 thought, "She has gone too far to draw back?she can refuse me
 nothing now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand
 clothes-dealer, and hurried to number 9, which happened to be the nearest
 gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat, and asked the
 way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not a little to
 the astonishment of the regular comers. All eyes were fixed on Eugene as
 he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to deposit his stakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it turns
 up, you will win thirty-six louis," said a respectable-looking,
 white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age). There
 was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had won.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take your money off, sir," said the old gentleman; "you don't often win
 twice running by that system."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his three
 thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of what he was
 about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched him enviously as
 they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again he won; the
 banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own," the old
 gentleman said in his ear. "Take my advice and go away with your winnings;
 red has turned up eight times already. If you are charitable, you will
 show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect
 of Napoleon who is down on his luck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac's head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the
 white-haired man's possession, and went down-stairs with his seven
 thousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by his
 luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So, that is over; and now where will you take me?" he asked, as soon as
 the door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de
 Nucingen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Delphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild
 embrace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have saved me!" she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend, will
 you not? I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I want, or I
 seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that M. de Nucingen
 does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all the bills for
 the house expenses; he pays for my carriages and opera box; he does not
 give me enough to pay for my dress, and he reduces me to poverty in secret
 on purpose. I am too proud to beg from him. I should be the vilest of
 women if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it. Do you
 ask how I, with seven hundred thousand francs of my own, could let myself
 be robbed? It is because I was proud, and scorned to speak. We are so
 young, so artless when our married life begins! I never could bring myself
 to ask my husband for money; the words would have made my lips bleed, I
 did not dare to ask; I spent my savings first, and then the money that my
 poor father gave me, then I ran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous
 farce; I cannot talk about it, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I
 have separate rooms, and that I would fling myself out of the window
 sooner than consent to any other manner of life. I suffered agonies when I
 had to confess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and
 trifles (for our poor father had never refused us anything, and spoiled
 us), but at last I found courage to tell him about them. After all, I had
 a fortune of my own. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be
 the ruin of him, and used frightful language! I wished myself a hundred
 feet down in the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but he
 stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a
 certain fixed sum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. And then," she
 went on, "I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom you know. He
 may have deceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there
 was nothing petty in his character. But, after all, he threw me over
 disgracefully. If, at a woman's utmost need, <i>somebody</i> heaps gold
 upon her, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever!
 But you, at one-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied
 conscience of youth, will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept
 money in such a way? <i>Mon Dieu</i>! is it not natural to share
 everything with the one to whom we owe our happiness? When all has been
 given, why should we pause and hesitate over a part? Money is as nothing
 between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together
 ceases to exist. Were we not bound to each other for life? Who that
 believes in love foresees such an end to love? You swear to love us
 eternally; how, then, can our interests be separate?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give me
 six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his
 mistress, an opera dancer! I thought of killing myself. The wildest
 thoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I have
 envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid. It was
 madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have bled him
 dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six
 thousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic to no purpose.
 You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside myself with anguish.
 Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad ravings. When you
 left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I longed to escape, to
 run away... where, I did not know. Half the women in Paris lead such lives
 as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and in their souls are tormented by
 anxiety. I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I; there are
 women who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills,
 women who rob their husbands. Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth
 a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs, others that a shawl
 costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis. There are women,
 too, with narrow incomes, who scrape and save and starve their children to
 pay for a dress. I am innocent of these base meannesses. But this is the
 last extremity of my torture. Some women will sell themselves to their
 husbands, and so obtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. If I
 chose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would rather weep on the
 breast of a man whom I can respect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will no
 longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid." She tried
 to conceal her tears from him, hiding her face in her hands; Eugene drew
 them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is hideous, is it not," she cried, "to speak in a breath of money and
 affection. You cannot love me after this," she added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great, and
 the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of
 society, had thrown Eugene's thoughts into confusion; he uttered soothing
 and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before him, and
 at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will not remember this against me?" she asked; "promise me that you
 will not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so," he said. She took his hand and
 held it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her deep
 gratitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am free and happy once more, thanks to you," she said. "Oh! I have felt
 lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. But after this I mean to
 live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me just as pretty, will
 you not, my friend? Keep this," she went on, as she took only six of the
 banknotes. "In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns, for I really ought
 to go halves with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene's maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, "I am
 bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy," he took the money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shall be a last stake in reserve," he said, "in case of misfortune."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was what I was dreading to hear," she cried, turning pale. "Oh, if
 you would that I should be anything to you, swear to me that you will
 never re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should corrupt you! I
 should die of sorrow!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast between
 the ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched condition of its
 mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin's cynical words began to ring in
 his ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seat yourself there," said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside
 the fire. "I have a difficult letter to write," she added. "Tell me what
 to say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say nothing," Eugene answered her. "Put the bills in an envelope, direct
 it, and send it by your maid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you are a love of a man," she said. "Ah! see what it is to have been
 well brought up. That is the Beauseant through and through," she went on,
 smiling at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is charming," thought Eugene, more and more in love. He looked round
 him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the luxury, a
 meretricious taste in the splendor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you like it?" she asked, as she rang for the maid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands yourself.
 If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Therese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen, she led
 the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of the
 table which he had admired in his cousin's house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens
 afterwards," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am a
 poor student, and I have my way to make."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! you will succeed," she said laughing. "You will see. All that you
 wish will come to pass. <i>I</i> did not expect to be so happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and to
 annihilate facts by presentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac
 took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore a look of
 happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small
 slanders against which women are defenceless; for the scandal that is
 uttered lightly is often seriously believed. Those who know Paris, believe
 nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene took the Baroness' hand in his, and by some light pressure of the
 fingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in which to
 express the sensations which the music gave them. It was an evening of
 intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out
 together, Mme. de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her as far as
 the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way for a single
 kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at the
 Palais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with inconsistency.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was gratitude," she said, "for devotion that I did not dare to hope
 for, but now it would be a promise."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And will you give me no promise, ingrate?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a
 lover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with a
 discontented air that delighted her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall see you at the ball on Monday," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections. He
 was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. He was pleased with an adventure
 which would probably give him his desire, for in the end one of the
 prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a set-off,
 he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon as he realized
 this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening began to take a more
 decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to reveal to us the strength of
 our hopes. The more Eugene learned of the pleasures of life in Paris, the
 more impatient he felt of poverty and obscurity. He crumpled the banknote
 in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible excuses for
 appropriating it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the stairhead
 he saw a light in Goriot's room; the old man had lighted a candle, and set
 the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by, and go to his room
 without "telling him all about his daughter," to use his own expression.
 Eugene, accordingly, told him everything without reserve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then they think that I am ruined!" cried Father Goriot, in an agony of
 jealousy and desperation. "Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a
 year! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Poor little girl! why did she not come to me? I
 would have sold my rentes; she should have had some of the principal, and
 I would have bought a life-annuity with the rest. My good neighbor, why
 did not <i>you</i> come to tell me of her difficulty? How had you the
 heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? This is
 heart-breaking work. You see what it is to have sons-in-law. Oh! if I had
 hold of them, I would wring their necks. <i>Mon Dieu! crying!</i> Did you
 say she was crying?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With her head on my waistcoat," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! give it to me," said Father Goriot. "What! my daughter's tears have
 fallen there?my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she was
 a little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it again; let me
 have it. By the terms of her marriage-contract, she ought to have the use
 of her property. To-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is an
 attorney. I will demand that her money should be invested in her own name.
 I know the law. I am an old wolf, I will show my teeth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted me
 to keep out of our winnings. Keep them for her, in the pocket of the
 waistcoat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Goriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student's hand,
 and Eugene felt a tear fall on it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will succeed," the old man said. "God is just, you see. I know an
 honest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men like
 you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I? There, go to sleep; you
 can sleep; you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I have to be told
 about it!?and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an idiot, all the
 time?I, who would sell the Father, Son and Holy Ghost to save one
 tear to either of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An honest man!" said Eugene to himself as he lay down. "Upon my word, I
 think I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey the
 voice of conscience." Perhaps none but believers in God do good in secret;
 and Eugene believed in a God.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de Beauseant,
 who took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. The Marechale
 received Eugene most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen was there. Delphine's
 dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration of others, so
 that she might shine the more in Eugene's eyes; she was eagerly expecting
 a glance from him, hiding, as she thought, this eagerness from all
 beholders. This moment is full of charm for one who can guess all that
 passes in a woman's mind. Who has not refrained from giving his opinion,
 to prolong her suspense, concealing his pleasure from a desire to
 tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying the
 fears that he can dissipate by a smile? In the course of the evening the
 law student suddenly comprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin
 of Mme. de Beauseant, he was a personage in this world. He was already
 credited with the conquest of Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason was a
 conspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young men, and
 experienced the earliest pleasures of coxcombry. People wondered at his
 luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his ears as he went from
 room to room; all the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her
 dread of losing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the
 kiss that all his entreaties could scarcely win yesterday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to other
 women who were present; women who could claim to be of the highest
 fashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this was the
 loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was launched.
 So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut; it was an evening
 that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman looks back upon her
 first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for
 the benefit of Father Goriot and the lodgers. Vautrin began to smile in a
 diabolical fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you suppose," cried that cold-blooded logician, "that a young man
 of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the Maison
 Vauquer?an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every way, I
 grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls short of being
 fashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its abundance; it
 is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac; but, after all, it is
 in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury would be out of place here,
 where we only aim at the purely <i>patriarchalorama</i>. If you mean to
 cut a figure in Paris, my young friend," Vautrin continued, with
 half-paternal jocularity, "you must have three horses, a tilbury for the
 mornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you should spend
 altogether about nine thousand francs on your stables. You would show
 yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than three thousand
 francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to
 your shoemaker, and a hundred more to your hatter. As for your laundress,
 there goes another thousand francs; a young man of fashion must of
 necessity make a great point of his linen; if your linen comes up to the
 required standard, people often do not look any further. Love and the
 Church demand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen thousand francs. I am
 saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible to
 allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money. I have led that sort
 of life, and I know all about these expenses. Add the cost of necessaries
 next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand francs for a place to
 roost in. Well, my boy, for all these little wants of ours we had need to
 have twenty-five thousand francs every year in our purse, or we shall find
 ourselves in the kennel, and people laughing at us, and our career is cut
 short, good-bye to success, and good-bye to your mistress! I am forgetting
 your valet and your groom! Is Christophe going to carry your <i>billets-doux</i>
 for you? Do you mean to employ the stationery you use at present? Suicidal
 policy! Hearken to the wisdom of your elders!" he went on, his bass voice
 growing louder at each syllable. "Either take up your quarters in a
 garret, live virtuously, and wed your work, or set about the thing in a
 different way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to enforce
 his remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting proposals by which
 he had sought to corrupt the student's mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Several days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He dined
 almost every day with Mme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only
 returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve in the small hours. He rose at
 mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was
 fine, squandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew.
 He turned as eagerly to learn the lessons of luxury, and was as quick to
 feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the
 fertilizing pollen. He played high, lost and won large sums of money, and
 at last became accustomed to the extravagant life that young men lead in
 Paris. He sent fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings to his
 mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the money. He had
 given out that he meant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and
 went, and he was still there, still unprepared to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One rule holds good of most young men?whether rich or poor. They
 never have money for the necessaries of life, but they have always money
 to spare for their caprices?an anomaly which finds its explanation
 in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps
 at pleasure. They are reckless with anything obtained on credit, while
 everything for which they must pay in ready money is made to last as long
 as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make up for it,
 it would seem, by squandering what they have. To state the matter simply?a
 student is far more careful of his hat than of his coat, because the
 latter being a comparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature
 of things that a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the
 hatter; the sums of money spent with him are so modest, that he is the
 most independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost
 impossible to bring him to terms. The young man in the balcony of a
 theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit of the fair
 owners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe, for
 the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble at the purse.
 This was Rastignac's condition. His purse was always empty for Mme.
 Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a periodical ebb
 and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to the payment of
 just debts. If he was to leave that unsavory and mean abode, where from
 time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the first step was to
 pay his hostess for a month's board and lodging, and the second to
 purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he must take in his quality
 of dandy, a course that remained impossible. Rastignac, out of his
 winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices for gold
 watches and chains, and then, to meet the exigencies of play, would carry
 them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding-looking friend of
 youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or lodging, or for
 the necessary implements for the cultivation of his Elysian fields, his
 imagination and pluck alike deserted him. There was no inspiration to be
 found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. Like
 most of those who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the
 payment of debts that among the bourgeoisie are regarded as sacred
 engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his baker's
 bill until it underwent a formidable transformation into a bill of
 exchange.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into
 debt, that it became clear to the law student's mind that he must have
 some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been
 doing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious
 situation, he felt that he could not bring himself to renounce the
 pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must continue it
 at all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more
 chimerical, and the real obstacles grew more formidable. His initiation
 into the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to him that if he
 were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his
 fortunes, he must swallow down all sense of decency, and renounce all the
 generous ideas which redeem the sins of youth. He had chosen this life of
 apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker worm of remorse, a
 life of fleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain; like <i>Le
 Distrait</i> of La Bruyere, he had descended so far as to make his bed in
 a ditch; but (also like <i>Le Distrait</i>) he himself was uncontaminated
 as yet by the mire that stained his garments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So we have killed our mandarin, have we?" said Bianchon one day as they
 left the dinner table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not yet," he answered, "but he is at his last gasp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. Eugene
 had dined in the house that night for the first time for a long while, and
 had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his place beside Mlle.
 Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an
 expressive glance from time to time. A few of the boarders discussed the
 walnuts at the table, and others walked about the room, still taking part
 in the conversation which had begun among them. People usually went when
 they chose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined by the
 amount of interest that the conversation possessed for them, or by the
 difficulty of the process of digestion. In winter-time the room was seldom
 empty before eight o'clock, when the four women had it all to themselves,
 and made up for the silence previously imposed upon them by the
 preponderating masculine element. This evening Vautrin had noticed
 Eugene's abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to
 be in a hurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk afterwards
 he had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite believed that
 Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position cunningly in the
 sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. He had fathomed
 the young man's thoughts, and felt that a crisis was at hand. Rastignac
 was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young man must have known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him, but
 in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all the alternations
 of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all the diplomatic arts of a
 Parisienne had been employed on him. After compromising herself by
 continually appearing in public with Mme. de Beauseant's cousin she still
 hesitated, and would not give him the lover's privileges which he appeared
 to enjoy. For a whole month she had so wrought on his senses, that at last
 she had made an impression on his heart. If in the earliest days the
 student had fancied himself to be master, Mme. de Nucingen had since
 become the stronger of the two, for she had skilfully roused and played
 upon every instinct, good or bad, in the two or three men comprised in a
 young student in Paris. This was not the result of deep design on her
 part, nor was she playing a part, for women are in a manner true to
 themselves even through their grossest deceit, because their actions are
 prompted by a natural impulse. It may have been that Delphine, who had
 allowed this young man to gain such an ascendency over her, conscious that
 she had been too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and
 either repented of her concessions, or it pleased her to suspend them. It
 is so natural to a Parisienne, even when passion has almost mastered her,
 to hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of him
 to whom she intrusts her future. And once already Mme. de Nucingen's hopes
 had been betrayed, and her loyalty to a selfish young lover had been
 despised. She had good reason to be suspicious. Or it may have been that
 something in Eugene's manner (for his rapid success was making a coxcomb
 of him) had warned her that the grotesque nature of their position had
 lowered her somewhat in his eyes. She doubtless wished to assert her
 dignity; he was young, and she would be great in his eyes; for the lover
 who had forsaken her had held her so cheap that she was determined that
 Eugene should not think her an easy conquest, and for this very reason?he
 knew that de Marsay had been his predecessor. Finally, after the
 degradation of submission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it
 was so sweet to her to wander in the flower-strewn realms of love, that it
 was not wonderful that she should wish to dwell a while on the prospect,
 to tremble with the vibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the
 breath of its dawn. The true lover was suffering for the sins of the
 false. This inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as
 men do not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman's soul by
 the first stroke of treachery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac,
 and took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because she felt sure of
 his love, and confident that she could put an end to the torture as soon
 as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugene's self-love was engaged; he
 could not suffer his first passage of love to end in a defeat, and
 persisted in his suit like a sportsman determined to bring down at least
 one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of Saint-Hubert. The pressure
 of anxiety, his wounded self-love, his despair, real or feigned, drew him
 nearer and nearer to this woman. All Paris credited him with this
 conquest, and yet he was conscious that he had made no progress since the
 day when he saw Mme. de Nucingen for the first time. He did not know as
 yet that a woman's coquetry is sometimes more delightful than the pleasure
 of secure possession of her love, and was possessed with helpless rage.
 If, at this time, while she denied herself to love, Eugene gathered the
 springtide spoils of his life, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and
 dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. There were moments when
 he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times he thought in spite of
 his conscience of Vautrin's offer and the possibility of fortune by a
 marriage with Mlle. Taillefer. Poverty would clamor so loudly that more
 than once he was on the point of yielding to the cunning temptations of
 the terrible sphinx, whose glance had so often exerted a strange spell
 over him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac,
 thinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat between
 Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding over the woolen cuffs that
 she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. Taillefer so tenderly
 that she lowered her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene?" Victorine said after a pause.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who has not his troubles?" answered Rastignac. "If we men were sure of
 being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the
 sacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should have
 no troubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was impossible to
 mistake its meaning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to-day, but
 are you sure that it will never change?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A smile flitted over the poor girl's lips; it seemed as if a ray of light
 from her soul had lighted up her face. Eugene was dismayed at the sudden
 explosion of feeling caused by his words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! but suppose," he said, "that you should be rich and happy to-morrow,
 suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds for you, would
 you still love the man whom you loved in your days of poverty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A charming movement of the head was her only answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Even if he were very poor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the same mute answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What nonsense are you talking, you two?" exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind," answered Eugene; "we understand each other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier
 Eugene de Rastignac and Mlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?" The words
 were uttered in Vautrin's deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at the door as
 he spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! how you startled me!" Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed
 together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I might make a worse choice," said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin's voice
 had thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No bad jokes, gentlemen!" said Mme. Couture. "My dear, let us go
 upstairs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in their
 room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight. Eugene and
 Vautrin were left alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I felt sure you would come round to it," said the elder man with the
 coolness that nothing seemed to shake. "But stay a moment! I have as much
 delicacy as anybody else. Don't make up your mind on the spur of the
 moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are in
 debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober
 reflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. Perhaps you want a
 thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes, which
 he fluttered before the student's eyes. Eugene was in a most painful
 dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a hundred louis to the
 Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the money, and
 for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud's house, where he
 was expected that evening. It was one of those informal gatherings where
 tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is possible to lose
 six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must see," said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor, "that
 after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself under any
 obligation to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise," answered the
 tempter. "You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion, and as
 gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for the devil! I like
 youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and you
 will see the world as it is. Make a little scene now and then, and act a
 virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders can do exactly
 as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery. Ah! a
 few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you would only be tutored by
 me, I would put you in the way of achieving all your ambitions. You should
 no sooner form a wish than it should be realized to the full; you should
 have all your desires?honors, wealth, or women. Civilization should
 flow with milk and honey for you. You should be our pet and favorite, our
 Benjamin. We would all work ourselves to death for you with pleasure;
 every obstacle should be removed from your path. You have a few prejudices
 left; so you think that I am a scoundrel, do you? Well, M. de Turenne,
 quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to be, had some little
 private transactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was
 tarnished. You would rather not lie under any obligation to me, eh? You
 need not draw back on that account," Vautrin went on, and a smile stole
 over his lips. "Take these bits of paper and write across this," he added,
 producing a piece of stamped paper, "<i>Accepted the sum of three thousand
 five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth</i>, and fill in the date.
 The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your part;
 it gives you the right to call me a Jew. You can call quits with me on the
 score of gratitude. I am quite willing that you should despise me to-day,
 because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling towards me later
 on. You will find out fathomless depths in my nature, enormous and
 concentrated forces that weaklings call vices, but you will never find me
 base or ungrateful. In short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a
 castle, a tower of strength, my boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What manner of man are you?" cried Eugene. "Were you created to torment
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece of
 work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your days. Do
 you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will tell you that some
 of these days. A word or two in your ear will explain it. I have begun by
 shocking you, by showing you the way to ring the changes, and giving you a
 sight of the mechanism of the social machine; but your first fright will
 go off like a conscript's terror on the battlefield. You will grow used to
 regarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose
 their lives for some self-constituted king. Times have altered strangely.
 Once you could say to a bravo, 'Here are a hundred crowns; go and kill
 Monsieur So-and-so for me,' and you could sup quietly after turning some
 one off into the dark for the least thing in the world. But nowadays I
 propose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune; you have only to nod
 your head, it won't compromise you in any way, and you hesitate. 'Tis an
 effeminate age."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, well. Come, now, let us talk rationally," Vautrin continued. "I
 mean to leave this country in a few months' time for America, and set
 about planting tobacco. I will send you the cigars of friendship. If I
 make money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no children?which
 will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself
 here?you shall inherit my fortune. That is what you may call
 standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I have a mania,
 too, for devoting myself to some one else. I have done it before. You see,
 my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men do; I look on all
 actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at. What is a
 man's life to me? Not <i>that</i>," he said, and he snapped his thumb-nail
 against his teeth. "A man, in short, is everything to me, or just nothing
 at all. Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret; you can crush
 him like a bug, he is flat and he is offensive. But a man is a god when he
 is like you; he is not a machine covered with a skin, but a theatre in
 which the greatest sentiments are displayed?great thoughts and
 feelings?and for these, and these only, I live. A sentiment?what
 is that but the whole world in a thought? Look at Father Goriot. For him,
 his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue by which he finds
 his way through creation. Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the
 depths of life, there is only one real sentiment?comradeship between
 man and man. Pierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. I knew <i>Venice
 Preserved</i> by heart. Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade
 says, 'Let us bury a dead body!' to go and do it without a word or
 plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? I have done it myself. I should
 not talk like this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary
 man; one can talk to you, you can understand things. You will not dabble
 about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. Well, then, it is
 all settled. You will marry. Both of us carry our point. Mine is made of
 iron, and will never soften, he! he!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student's repudiation, he
 wished to put Eugene at his ease. He seemed to understand the secret
 springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man; the
 struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying
 their blameworthy actions to themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is
 certain," said Eugene to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of
 Vautrin's ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for his
 own ends, raised him in the student's eyes; but the thought of a compact
 threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he had recovered
 somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de Restaud's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man
 whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it seemed
 to her that he might be a formidable power before long. He paid Messieurs
 de Trailles and d'Ajuda, played at whist for part of the evening, and made
 good his losses. Most men who have their way to make are more or less of
 fatalists, and Eugene was superstitious; he chose to consider that his
 luck was heaven's reward for his perseverance in the right way. As soon as
 possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had
 given was still in the other's possession; and on receiving a reply in the
 affirmative, he repaid the three thousand francs with a not unnatural
 relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything is going on well," said Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I am not your accomplice," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know, I know," Vautrin broke in. "You are still acting like a child.
 You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a
 bench in the sun. They had chosen a little frequented alley in the Jardin
 des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same person, as a
 matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not without good
 reason, his own suspicions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mademoiselle," this M. Gondureau was saying, "I do not see any cause for
 your scruples. His Excellency, Monseigneur the Minister of Police??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter," said
 Gondureau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Who would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless
 possessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be nothing
 else in his head?who would think it likely that such a man would
 continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue
 de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that
 word "police," and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective from the
 Rue de Jerusalem? And yet nothing was more natural. Perhaps the following
 remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers
 will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret belonged in
 the great family of fools. There is a race of quill-drivers, confined in
 the columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude (a kind of
 administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at twelve hundred
 francs) to the third degree, a more temperate zone, where incomes grow
 from three to six thousand francs, a climate where the <i>bonus</i>
 flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some difficulties of
 culture. A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble
 narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of
 involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of
 every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature (an
 illegible scrawl) and by his title?"His Excellency Monseigneur le
 Ministre," five words which produce as much effect as the <i>il Bondo Cani</i>
 of the <i>Calife de Bagdad</i>, five words which in the eyes of this low
 order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no
 appeal. The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the
 employ of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics.
 Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says, or
 that is said or done in his name; the robe of office covers everything and
 legalizes everything done by his orders; does not his very title?His
 Excellency?vouch for the purity of his intentions and the
 righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of passport and
 introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a
 moment? Pronounce the words "His Excellency," and these poor folk will
 forthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests.
 Passive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in the
 army itself; and the administrative system silences consciences,
 annihilates the individual, and ends (give it time enough) by fashioning a
 man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery of
 Government. Wherefore, M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something of human
 nature, recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom,
 and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment, the <i>deus ex
 machina</i>, the magical words "His Excellency," so as to dazzle Poiret
 just as he himself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the
 Michonneau for the male and female of the same species.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister... Ah! that is
 quite another thing," said Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem to be guided by this gentleman's opinion, and you hear what he
 says," said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle. Michonneau.
 "Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the
 so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict who
 escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the nickname
 <i>Trompe-la-Mort</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trompe-la-Mort?" said Pioret. "Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves
 that nickname."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, yes," said the detective. "They call him so because he has been so
 lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he has
 carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has qualities that are
 out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a matter which
 gained him no end of credit with his own set??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then is he a man of honor?" asked Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man's crime upon
 himself?a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that he
 had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler, who has
 since gone into the army, where his conduct has been unexceptionable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin
 is this <i>Trompe-la-Mort</i>, why should he want me?" asked Mlle.
 Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh yes," said Poiret, "if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as
 to tell us, really knows for a certainty??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand how
 things are. Jacques Collin, nicknamed <i>Trompe-la-Mort</i>, is in the
 confidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of
 business and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing
 their affairs, which want a <i>man of mark</i> to see about them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?" asked Poiret. "This gentleman
 calls himself a <i>man of mark</i> because he is a <i>marked man</i>?branded,
 you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This so-called Vautrin," said the detective, "receives the money
 belonging to my lords the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it at
 the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their families if
 they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for
 their benefit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Their mistresses! You mean their wives," remarked Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir. A convict's wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We call
 them concubines."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then they all live in a state of concubinage?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Naturally."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow. Since
 you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have
 philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral
 conduct?they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues, my
 dear sir??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course not, sir; but still??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie," said Mlle.
 Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see how it is, mademoiselle," Gondureau continued. "The Government
 may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its
 hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all that we can make
 out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the
 convicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the
 Society of the Ten Thousand??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ten Thousand Thieves!" cried Pioret in alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty
 offenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale?they
 won't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it. It is
 composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the
 Assize Courts when they come up for trial. They know the Code too well to
 risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is their confidential agent
 and legal adviser. By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he
 has established a sort of detective system of his own; it is widespread
 and mysterious in its workings. We have had spies all about him for a
 twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage to fathom his games. His capital
 and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime; this money
 furnishes the necessary funds for a regular army of blackguards in his pay
 who wage incessant war against society. If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort,
 and take possession of his funds, we should strike at the root of this
 evil. So this job is a kind of Government affair?a State secret?and
 likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing to a
 successful conclusion. You, sir, for instance, might very well be taken
 into a Government department again; they might make you secretary to a
 Commissary of Police; you could accept that post without prejudice to your
 retiring pension."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, "What is there to hinder
 Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" said the detective, "a man is told off to follow him everywhere he
 goes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. Then it is
 not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away
 with a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow to
 play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to his notions."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are quite right, sir," said Poiret, "utterly disgraced he would be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without
 more ado," remarked Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain?but," he added in her ear,
 "keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. The old boy ought
 to pay people handsomely for listening to him.?Trompe-la-Mort, when
 he came back here," he went on aloud "slipped into the skin of an honest
 man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and took up his
 quarters in an unpretending lodging-house. He is cunning, that he is! You
 don't catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of consequence, who
 transacts a good deal of business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Naturally," said Poiret to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the
 real Vautrin, he would put every one's back up among the business men in
 Paris, and public opinion would be against him. M. le Prefet de Police is
 on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take advantage of any
 mistake. There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition, and
 he would be sent packing. We must set about this just as we did about the
 Coignard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene; if he had been the real
 Comte de Sainte-Helene, we should have been in the wrong box. We want to
 be quite sure what we are about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman," said Mlle. Michonneau briskly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him," said the detective.
 "I will tell you a secret?he does not like them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to identify
 him for two thousand francs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing simpler," said the stranger. "I will send you a little bottle
 containing a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will do
 him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit. The
 drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. You
 carry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is not
 dying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the shoulder, and
 <i>presto!</i> the letters will appear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, that is just nothing at all," said Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, do you agree?" said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all," said Mlle.
 Michonneau; "am I to have the two thousand francs all the same?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What will you give me then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Five hundred francs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience just
 the same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I assure you," said Poiret, "that mademoiselle has a great deal of
 conscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very
 intelligent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now," Mlle. Michonneau went on, "make it three thousand francs if
 he is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Done!" said Gondureau, "but on the condition that the thing is settled
 to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are a sly one," said the detective as he rose to his feet. "Good-bye
 till to-morrow, then. And if you should want to see me in a hurry, go to
 the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la Sainte-Chapelle.
 There is one door under the archway. Ask there for M. Gondureau."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon, on his way back from Cuvier's lecture, overheard the
 sufficiently striking nickname of <i>Trompe-la-Mort</i>, and caught the
 celebrated chief detective's "<i>Done!</i>"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a year,"
 said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't I?" she asked. "Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that M.
 Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves
 with him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for money, it would put
 him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without paying, and
 that would be an abominable sell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And suppose you did warn him," Poiret went on, "didn't that gentleman say
 that he was closely watched? You would spoil everything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anyhow," thought Mlle. Michonneau, "I can't abide him. He says nothing
 but disagreeable things to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you can do better than that," Poiret resumed. "As that gentleman said
 (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being very
 well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society of a
 criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief, always a thief.
 Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all? The deuce! We
 should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall victims into
 the bargain!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to
 the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret's lips like water dripping
 from a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to talk, he would
 go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him. He started on
 some subject or other, and wandered on through parenthesis after
 parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible from his
 premises without coming to any conclusions by the way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole
 string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject
 in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own deposition in the
 case of the Sieur Ragoulleau <i>versus</i> Dame Morin, when he had been
 summoned as a witness for the defence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart
 with Mlle. Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling
 interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they passed
 through the room. None of this was thrown away on Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knew how it would end," remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. "They
 have been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a week
 past."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he answered. "So she was found guilty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mme. Morin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am talking about Mlle. Victorine," said Mlle, Michonneau, as she
 entered Poiret's room with an absent air, "and you answer, 'Mme. Morin.'
 Who may Mme. Morin be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?" demanded Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further
 and further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own
 mind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately
 shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary
 man professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an
 alliance. Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the
 gulf into which he had walked an hour ago, when he exchanged vows in the
 softest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she
 heard an angel's voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Maison
 Vauquer took strange and wonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She
 loved and she was loved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and
 what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac's face
 and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under
 the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had trampled on his conscience;
 he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately; he had said to
 himself that a woman's happiness should atone for this venial sin. The
 energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face; the lurid fire that
 burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily for him, the miracle took
 place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and at once read the hearts of
 these two young creatures whom he had brought together by the combinations
 of his infernal genius, but his deep voice broke in upon their bliss.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "A charming girl is my Fanchette
 In her simplicity,"
</pre>
 <p>
 he sang mockingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Victorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it was
 full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the hand, the
 light touch of Rastignac's hair against her cheek, a word whispered in her
 ear so closely that she felt the student's warm breath on her, the
 pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss upon her throat?such
 had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of the stout Sylvie, who
 might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made these first
 tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing than the
 noblest deeds done for love's sake in the most famous romances. This <i>plain-song</i>
 of love, to use the pretty expression of our forefathers, seemed almost
 criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight.
 In that one hour she had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than
 she could give in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self
 followed the gift.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The thing is arranged," Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. "Our two
 dandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is a
 matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet
 to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the
 morning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee
 cup, will be sole heiress of her father's fortune and affections. A funny
 way of putting it, isn't it? Taillefer's youngster is an expert swordsman,
 and quite cocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just invented a
 thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your sword point and driving it
 at the forehead. I must show you that thrust; it is an uncommonly handy
 thing to know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in
 reply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders
 likewise appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is just as I intended." Vautrin said. "You know quite well what you
 are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you are
 strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I respect you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He made as though he would take Eugene's hand, but Rastignac hastily
 withdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to him
 that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes of
 virtue about us!" murmured Vautrin. "But Papa Doliban has three millions;
 I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in your hands, and
 your character will be as white as the bride's white dress, even in your
 own eyes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go that
 evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as Vautrin left
 him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, "You look melancholy, my
 boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke.
 Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us go up to your room," the worthy soul remarked, when he had asked
 Sylvie for the law student's key. "This morning," he resumed, "you thought
 that <i>she</i> did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She would have
 nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and out of heart.
 Stuff and rubbish! She wanted you to go because she was expecting <i>me</i>!
 Now do you understand? We were to complete the arrangements for taking
 some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you are to move into it in
 three days' time. Don't split upon me. She wants it to be a surprise; but
 I couldn't bear to keep the secret from you. You will be in the Rue
 d'Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and you are to be
 housed like a prince! Any one might have thought we were furnishing the
 house for a bride. Oh! we have done a lot of things in the last month, and
 you knew nothing about it. My attorney has appeared on the scene, and my
 daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her
 money, and I shall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in
 sound securities, landed property that won't run away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his
 cheerless, untidy room. Father Goriot waited till the student's back was
 turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and set upon
 it a little red morocco case with Rastignac's arms stamped in gold on the
 leather.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear boy," said the kind soul, "I have been up to the eyes in this
 business. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have an
 interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not refuse
 me if I ask you something; will you, eh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let
 along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn't that so? I am
 getting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the way, but I
 shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me about her every
 evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall have gone to bed
 before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall say to
 myself, 'He has just seen my little Delphine. He has been to a dance with
 her, and she is happy, thanks to him.' If I were ill, it would do my heart
 good to hear you moving about below, to know when you leave the house and
 when you come in. It is only a step to the Champs-Elysees, where they go
 every day, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now I am sometimes
 too late. And then?perhaps she may come to see you! I shall hear
 her, I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping about as
 daintily as a kitten. In this one month she has become my little girl
 again, so light-hearted and gay. Her soul is recovering, and her happiness
 is owing to you! Oh! I would do impossibilities for you. Only just now she
 said to me, 'I am very happy, papa!' When they say 'father' stiffly, it
 sends a chill through me; but when they call me 'papa,' it brings all the
 old memories back. I feel most their father then; I even believe that they
 belong to me, and to no one else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long
 time since she took my arm as she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it must be
 quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls. How
 pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown, the
 warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this morning; I went
 shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh! you must let me live
 near you. You may want some one to do you a service some of these days,
 and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh! if only that great dolt of an
 Alsatian would die, if his gout would have the sense to attack his
 stomach, how happy my poor child would be! You would be my son-in-law; you
 would be her husband in the eyes of the world. Bah! she has known no
 happiness, that excuses everything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the
 side of fathers on earth who love their children. How fond of you she is!"
 he said, raising his head after a pause. "All the time we were going about
 together she chatted away about you. 'He is so nice-looking, papa; isn't
 he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you about me?' Pshaw! she said
 enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue d'Artois and the
 Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine. I did not feel
 old once during that delightful morning; I felt as light as a feather. I
 told her how you had given the banknote to me; it moved my darling to
 tears. But what can this be on your chimney-piece?" said Father Goriot at
 last. Rastignac had showed no sign, and he was dying of impatience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He thought
 of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this
 realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast between the two
 sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. He went to the
 chimney-piece, saw the little square case, opened it, and found a watch of
 Breguet's make wrapped in paper, on which these words were written:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "I want you to think of me every hour, <i>because</i>...

 "DELPHINE."
</pre>
 <p>
 That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had
 taken place between them. Eugene felt touched. Inside the gold watch-case
 his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key, the workmanship
 and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined, for he had
 long coveted such a possession. Father Goriot was radiant. Of course he
 had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the scene and of
 the effect produced upon Eugene by her present; he shared in the pleasure
 and excitement of the young people, and seemed to be not the least happy
 of the three. He loved Rastignac already for his own as well as for his
 daughter's sake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That great
 lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera-dancer. Aha! he
 looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was. He says he
 idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better let her alone, or I will kill
 him. To think that my Delphine is his"?he heaved a sigh?"it is
 enough to make me murder him, but it would not be manslaughter to kill
 that animal; he is a pig with a calf's brains.?You will take me with
 you, will you not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not you!
 Let me embrace you," and he flung his arms around the student's neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go to
 her this evening, will you not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I be of any use?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer's while I go to Mme. de
 Nucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening;
 it is a matter of life and death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really, young man!" cried Father Goriot, with a change of countenance;
 "are you really paying court to his daughter, as those simpletons were
 saying down below?... <i>Tonnerre de dieu!</i> you have no notion what a
 tap <i>a la Goriot</i> is like, and if you are playing a double game, I
 shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist... Oh! the thing is
 impossible!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world," said the student.
 "I only knew it a moment ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! what happiness!" cried Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to-morrow
 morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what business is it of yours?" said Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting in
 an appearance??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just at that moment Vautrin's voice broke in upon them; he was standing at
 the threshold of his door and singing:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Oh! Richard, oh my king!
 All the world abandons thee!
 Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!

 The same old story everywhere,
 A roving heart and a... tra la la."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen!" shouted Christophe, "the soup is ready, and every one is
 waiting for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here," Vautrin called down to him, "come and take a bottle of my
 Bordeaux."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think your watch is pretty?" asked Goriot. "She has good taste,
 hasn't she? Eh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and, all
 three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner;
 but the other, so charming in Mme. Vauquer's opinion, had never been so
 witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole table in good
 humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with consternation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what has come to you to-day?" inquired Mme. Vauquer. "You are as
 merry as a skylark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bargain?" said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall be
 paid a handsome commission on them?Mlle. Michonneau," he went on,
 seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, "have you
 any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making those lynx
 eyes at me? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige you...
 We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?" he added, winking at
 the superannuated clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules,"
 said the young painter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the
 Venus of Pere-Lachaise," replied Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's Poiret," suggested Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!" cried Vautrin;
 "his name means a pear??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A sleepy pear!" Bianchon put in. "You will come in between the pear and
 the cheese."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What stuff are you all talking!" said Mme. Vauquer; "you would do better
 to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle there. It would
 keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the stomach besides."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," said Vautrin, "the Lady President calls us to order. Mme.
 Couture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but respect
 the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass or two of
 Bordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no
 political allusions intended.?Come, you Turk!" he added, looking at
 Christophe, who did not offer to stir. "Christophe! Here! What, you don't
 answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here it is, sir," said Christophe, holding out the bottle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin filled Eugene's glass and Goriot's likewise, then he deliberately
 poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it while his two
 neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a grimace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Corked!" he cried. "The devil! You can drink the rest of this,
 Christophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right-hand side,
 you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you are going to stand treat," said the painter, "I will pay for a
 hundred chestnuts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! oh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Booououh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Prrr!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set
 firework.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne," called
 Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Quien!</i> just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A
 couple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall never
 see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene has a mind to pay for
 it, I have some currant cordial."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught," muttered the
 medical student.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shut up, Bianchon," exclaimed Rastignac; "the very mention of black
 draught makes me feel??. Yes, champagne, by all means; I will
 pay for it," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sylvie," called Mme. Vauquer, "bring in some biscuits, and the little
 cakes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards," said Vautrin. "But trot out
 the biscuits."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene
 than ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries of
 various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official having
 taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the caterwauling of
 the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously struck up with the
 following variations:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Scissors to grind!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Brandy-snaps, ladies!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "China to mend!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boat ahoy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Old clo'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cherries all ripe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he
 rendered the cry of "Umbrellas to me-end!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the room, a
 storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats' concert, with Vautrin as conductor of
 the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on Eugene and Father
 Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already. They leaned
 back in their chairs, looking at the general confusion with an air of
 gravity, and drank but little; both of them were absorbed in the thought
 of what lay before them to do that evening, and yet neither of them felt
 able to rise and go. Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time,
 and watched the change that came over their faces, choosing the moment
 when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac
 and to say in his ear:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin
 yet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs.
 When I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence can
 put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer, telling
 tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the bread is
 ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and whisk away the crumbs;
 and we are not going to spoil the baking? ... No, no, it is all as good as
 done! We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples, but they will be
 digested along with the bread. While we are having our forty winks,
 Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer's
 inheritance with the point of his sword. Victorine will come in for her
 brother's money, a snug fifteen thousand francs a year. I have made
 inquiries already, and I know that her late mother's property amounts to
 more than three hundred thousand??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed to
 be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was creeping
 over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but it was
 through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by one the
 boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled that the party
 consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle. Victorine, Vautrin, and
 Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme. Vauquer
 busied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the remainder of the
 wine out of each to fill others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!" said the
 widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this," said Sylvie.
 "There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, mamma," said Vautrin; "I am going to a theatre on the boulevard
 to see M. Marty in <i>Le Mont Sauvage</i>, a fine play taken from <i>Le
 Solitaire</i>.... If you like, I will take you and these two ladies??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you; I must decline," said Mme. Couture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! my good lady!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "decline to see a play founded
 on the <i>Le Solitaire</i>, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were so
 fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the <i>line-trees</i>
 last summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your young
 lady."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are forbidden to go to the play," answered Victorine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit," said
 Vautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He altered the sleeping student's position, settled his head more
 comfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the forehead,
 and began to sing:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Sleep, little darlings;
 I watch while you slumber."
</pre>
 <p>
 "I am afraid he may be ill," said Victorine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then stop and take care of him," returned Vautrin. "'Tis your duty as a
 meek and obedient wife," he whispered in her ear. "The young fellow
 worships you, and you will be his little wife?there's your fortune
 for you. In short," he added aloud, "they lived happily ever afterwards,
 were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a numerous family.
 That is how all the romances end.?Now, mamma," he went on, as he
 turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, "put on your
 bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess' scarf, while I go out
 and call a cab?all my own self."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he started out, singing as he went:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Oh! sun! divine sun!
 Ripening the pumpkins every one."
</pre>
 <p>
 "My goodness! Well, I'm sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a
 garret with a man like that.?There, now!" she added, looking round
 for the old vermicelli maker, "there is that Father Goriot half seas over.
 <i>He</i> never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But he
 will measure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to lose his
 senses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he couldn't lose
 what he hadn't got?Sylvie, just take him up to his room!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just as
 he was, like a package, across the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor young fellow!" said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene's hair that
 had fallen over his eyes; "he is like a young girl, he does not know what
 dissipation is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I can tell you this, I know," said Mme. Vauquer, "I have taken
 lodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my hands,
 as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more aristocratic
 looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks sleeping! Just let
 his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture. Pshaw! he falls over towards
 Mlle. Victorine. There's a special providence for young things. A little
 more, and he would have broken his head against the knob of the chair.
 They'd make a pretty pair those two would!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush, my good neighbor," cried Mme. Couture, "you are saying such things??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pooh!" put in Mme. Vauquer, "he does not hear.?Here, Sylvie! come
 and help me to dress. I shall put on my best stays."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?" said Sylvie. "No, you
 can get some one else to lace you. I am not going to be your murderer.
 It's a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, Sylvie, don't argue," said the widow, as she left the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At her age, too!" said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress as
 she spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene slept
 on Victorine's shoulder. The sound of Christophe's snoring echoed through
 the silent house; Eugene's quiet breathing seemed all the quieter by force
 of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child. Victorine was very
 happy; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an
 innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments of a woman's nature; he
 was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of his heart; there
 was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in
 Victorine's face. Among the countless thoughts that crowded up in her
 young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of joy at this close
 contact.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor, dear child!" said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old lady looked at the girl. Victorine's innocent, pathetic face, so
 radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to mind some
 naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the accessories,
 reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet, austere outlines and
 ivory tints of the face, which seems to have caught something of the
 golden glory of heaven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all, he only took two glasses, mamma," said Victorine, passing her
 fingers through Eugene's hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have
 carried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him credit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a sound of wheels outside in the street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is M. Vautrin, mamma," said the girl. "Just take M. Eugene. I would
 rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways of looking
 at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though you had
 nothing on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, you are wrong!" said Mme. Couture. "M. Vautrin is a worthy man;
 he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough but
 kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but
 looked for a while at the picture of the two young faces?the
 lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," he remarked, folding his arms, "here is a picture! It would have
 suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good soul),
 who wrote <i>Paul et Virginie</i>. Youth is very charming, Mme. Couture!?Sleep
 on, poor boy," he added, looking at Eugene, "luck sometimes comes while
 you are sleeping.?There is something touching and attractive to me
 about this young man, madame," he continued; "I know that his nature is in
 harmony with his face. Just look, the head of a cherub on an angel's
 shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were a woman, I would die (no?not
 such a fool), I would live for him." He bent lower and spoke in the
 widow's ear. "When I see those two together, madame, I cannot help
 thinking that Providence meant them for each other; He works by secret
 ways, and tries the reins and the heart," he said in a loud voice. "And
 when I see you, my children, thus united by a like purity and by all human
 affections, I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future
 should separate you. God is just."?He turned to Victorine. "It seems
 to me," he said, "that I have seen the line of success in your hand. Let
 me look at it, Mlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told
 fortunes many a time. Come, now, don't be frightened. Ah! what do I see?
 Upon my word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before
 very long. You will heap riches on the man who loves you. Your father will
 want you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome man
 with a title, and he will idolize you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the
 stairs, interrupted Vautrin's fortune-telling. "Here is Mamma Vauquerre,
 fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.?Aren't we a
 trifle pinched for room?" he inquired, with his arm round the lady; "we
 are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma! If we are much
 agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the fragments with
 all the care of an antiquary."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!" said the
 widow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, little ones!" said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and Victorine.
 "Bless you both!" and he laid a hand on either head. "Take my word for it,
 young lady, an honest man's prayers are worth something; they should bring
 you happiness, for God hears them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, dear," said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. "Do you think that M.
 Vautrin means to run away with me?" she added, lowering her voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lack-a-day!" said the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin
 said!" said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands. The two
 women were alone together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, it wouldn't take much to bring it to pass," said the elderly lady;
 "just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! mamma."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy," the
 widow remarked. "I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew flowers on
 his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth.
 Black-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn't speak up for his own
 mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery. My cousin
 had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing was said
 in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in for."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life,"
 said Victorine. "If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to be taken out
 of the world, I would rather stay here all my life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full
 of piety, you see," Mme. Couture remarked. "I am very glad to find that he
 is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty with
 less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was saying, who can
 know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With Sylvie's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene up to
 his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened his clothes to
 make him more comfortable. Before they left the room, Victorine snatched
 an opportunity when her guardian's back was turned, and pressed a kiss on
 Eugene's forehead, feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could
 give her. Then she looked round the room, and gathering up, as it were,
 into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day, she made a
 picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until she slept, the happiest
 creature in Paris.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That evening's merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given the
 drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin. Bianchon,
 flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of Trompe-la-Mort with
 Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on
 his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real name, Jacques Collin, was
 in fact the notorious escaped convict.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally decided
 his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the
 convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea of making a
 better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night; but as it
 was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of
 detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still thinking that it was the
 district superintendent?one Gondureau?with whom she had to do.
 The head of the department received his visitors courteously. There was a
 little talk, and the details were definitely arranged. Mlle. Michonneau
 asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to set about her
 investigation. But the great man's evident satisfaction set Mlle.
 Michonneau thinking; and she began to see that this business involved
 something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict. She racked her
 brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial, and
 it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous revelations made by
 the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable
 sum of money. But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite
 Rue Saint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the
 scent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A delusion," he said. "Collin's <i>sorbonne</i> is the most dangerous
 that has yet been found among the dangerous classes. That is all, and the
 rascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the backbone of
 the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them all.
 The rogue will never leave his <i>chump</i> in the Place de Greve."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two slang
 words for her benefit. <i>Sorbonne</i> and <i>chump</i> are two forcible
 expressions borrowed from thieves' Latin, thieves, of all people, being
 compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A sorbonne is the
 head of a living man, his faculty of thinking?his council; a chump
 is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth
 after the axe has done its work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Collin is playing us off," he continued. "When we come across a man like
 a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always one
 resource left?we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make
 the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of killing
 Collin to-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid of him
 without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with getting up
 the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the
 sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before
 you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings, over and above the
 three thousand francs that you are going to have. There is a saving in
 time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort's paunch
 will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty scoundrels from following
 his example; they will be very careful to keep themselves out of the
 police courts. That is doing the work of the police thoroughly, and true
 philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to
 punish it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you do a service to our country," said Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you are,"
 said the head of the department. "Yes, of course, we are serving our
 country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great
 services that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise above
 vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that
 doing right entails, when right is done in an out-of-the-way style. Paris
 is Paris, you see! That is the explanation of my life.?I have the
 honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle. I shall bring my men to
 the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send Christophe to the Rue du Buffon,
 tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me before.?Your
 servant, sir. If you should ever have anything stolen from you, come to
 me, and I will do my best to get it back for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now," Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, "there are idiots who
 are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very
 pleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as
 saying 'Good-day.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the
 annals of the Maison Vauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence in
 its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like apparition of
 the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes of this great day
 were to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an
 inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her boarders so
 long as she lived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close
 upon eleven o'clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight from the
 Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a prolonged slumber
 (he had finished Vautrin's first bottle of wine), was behindhand with his
 work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint, though
 breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme. Couture, they also lay
 late. Vautrin went out before eight o'clock, and only came back just as
 breakfast was ready. Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie and
 Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven, knocked at all the doors, and
 announced that breakfast was waiting. While Sylvie and the man were
 upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who came down first, poured the contents of
 the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin?it was standing
 with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning
 coffee. The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the house to do her
 stroke of business. The seven lodgers were at last collected together, not
 without some difficulty. Just as Eugene came downstairs, stretching
 himself and yawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de
 Nucingen. It ran thus:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my friend.
 Till two o'clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that waiting for one
 whom you love! No one that had passed through that torture could inflict
 it on another. I know now that you have never loved before. What can have
 happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I would have come myself to find
 out what had happened, if I had not feared to betray the secrets of my
 heart. How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day? Would it not
 be ruin? I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman. Send a
 word to reassure me, and explain how it is that you have not come after
 what my father told you. I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. One
 word, for pity's sake. You will come to me soon, will you not? If you are
 busy, a line will be enough. Say, 'I will hasten to you,' or else, 'I am
 ill.' But if you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. What
 can have happened?..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, indeed, what has happened?" exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down to
 the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any more. "What
 time is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Half-past eleven," said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his
 coffee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating
 glance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics in
 a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in every limb. There
 was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man with a
 scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M. Taillefer's servants;
 Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mademoiselle," he cried, "your father is asking for you?something
 terrible has happened! M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the forehead
 in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will scarcely be in time
 to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor young fellow!" exclaimed Vautrin. "How can people brawl when they
 have a certain income of thirty thousand livres? Young people have bad
 manners, and that is a fact."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir!" cried Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what then, you big baby!" said Vautrin, swallowing down his coffee
 imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with such close
 attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing news that had
 struck the others dumb with amazement. "Are there not duels every morning
 in Paris?" added Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will go with you, Victorine," said Mme. Couture, and the two women
 hurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she went,
 Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance that said?"How
 little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin," said Mme. Vauquer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am all sorts of things," said Vautrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Queer, isn't it?" said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession of
 commonplaces suited to the occasion. "Death takes us off without asking us
 about it. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky thing for us
 women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have other complaints
 that men don't suffer from. We bear children, and it takes a long time to
 get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her father will have to
 acknowledge her now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There!" said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, "yesterday she had not a penny;
 this morning she has several millions to her fortune."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, M. Eugene!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "you have landed on your feet!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the
 crumpled letter still in his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to be
 like the rest of them?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine," said Eugene, turning to
 Mme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised the
 onlookers at this scene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot caught the student's hand and grasped it warmly. He could
 have kissed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, ho!" said Vautrin, "the Italians have a good proverb?<i>Col
 tempo</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there any answer?" said Mme. de Nucingen's messenger, addressing
 Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say that I will come directly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he
 could not be prudent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is to be done?" he exclaimed aloud. "There are no proofs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its work,
 the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a
 look, and said in hollow tones, "Luck comes to us while we sleep, young
 man," and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So there is a Divine Justice!" said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A stroke!" cried Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor," called the widow. "Oh, M.
 Rastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie
 might not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his hurry
 for the doctor was nothing but a flight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist's and ask for something that's
 good for the apoplexy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Christophe likewise went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow
 staircase, and laid upon his bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter," said M. Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Selfish old thing!" cried Mme. Vauquer. "Yes, go; I wish you may die like
 a dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just go and see if you can find some ether," said Mlle. Michonneau to
 Mme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened the
 sick man's clothes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress of
 the situation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be of
 some use in sparing my modesty," she said to Poiret, "instead of standing
 there like a stock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap,
 and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily," exclaimed
 Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on the shirt
 again.?"Ouf! How heavy he is," he added, as he laid the convict
 down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!" said the old maid briskly; her
 glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article of the
 furniture with greedy eyes. "Could we find some excuse for opening that
 desk?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It mightn't be quite right," responded Poiret to this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it
 doesn't belong to any one now. But we haven't time, there is the Vauquer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is the ether," said that lady. "I must say that this is an eventful
 day. Lord! that man can't have had a stroke; he is as white as curds."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "White as curds?" echoed Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And his pulse is steady," said the widow, laying her hand on his breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Steady?" said the astonished Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think so?" asked Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a doctor.
 I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is only a
 spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look,
 mademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort of
 man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however. Dear
 me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears a wig.
 They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best. Is he
 one of the good ones, I wonder?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good to hang," said Poiret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Round a pretty woman's neck, you mean," said Mlle Michonneau, hastily.
 "Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman's duty to nurse you men when you
 are ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may as well take
 yourself off," she added. "Mme. Vauquer and I will take great care of dear
 M. Vautrin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the
 room by his master.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to
 breathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to
 prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had
 happened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he himself
 might be implicated. Vautrin's coolness still further dismayed him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?" Rastignac asked
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of
 justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the pack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" shouted Bianchon, "you have seen the <i>Pilote</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The <i>Pilote</i> was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out
 several hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the benefit
 of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into provincial
 districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is a wonderful history in it," said the house student of the
 Hopital Cochin. "Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the Old
 Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his forehead.
 And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris! If we
 had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They say Victorine was
 sweet on you; was there any truth in it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a charming
 woman, and she is in love with me, so??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her.
 I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer's
 money!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are all the devils of hell at my heels?" cried Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand," said
 Bianchon, "and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just go to Mother Vauquer's," said Rastignac; "that scoundrel Vautrin has
 dropped down like one dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha!" said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, "you confirm
 my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The law student's long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in some
 sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after hesitation
 and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out scatheless from this
 sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron tested in the English
 fashion. He remembered Father Goriot's confidences of the evening before;
 he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue d'Artois, so that he
 might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his letter, and read it
 again and kissed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such a love is my anchor of safety," he said to himself. "How the old
 man's heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he has
 been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like a son to
 him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she will often
 come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a
 heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall porter. Dear
 Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. Ah!
 this evening I shall be very happy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took out his watch and admired it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other for
 ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides, I shall
 succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing criminal in
 this <i>liaison</i>; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to
 frown. How many respectable people contract similar unions! We deceive
 nobody; it is deception that makes a position humiliating. If you lie, you
 lower yourself at once. She and her husband have lived apart for a long
 while. Besides, how if I called upon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom
 he cannot make happy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac's battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the
 scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity led
 him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison Vauquer through the
 gathering dusk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the
 stomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau's
 officious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of her.
 Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was impossible not to
 suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics at the lodging-house.
 Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the dining-room when
 Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual by the
 news of young Taillefer's duel. They were anxious to hear any detail about
 the affair, and to talk over the probable change in Victorine's prospects.
 Father Goriot alone was absent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did
 Eugene come into the room, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of
 Vautrin. It was the same look that had read his thoughts before?the
 look that had such power to waken evil thoughts in his heart. He
 shuddered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, dear boy," said the escaped convict, "I am likely to cheat death
 for a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a stroke that
 would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A bull you might say," cried the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You really might be sorry to see me still alive," said Vautrin in
 Rastignac's ear, thinking that he guessed the student's thoughts. "You
 must be mighty sure of yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman
 named <i>Trompe-la-Mort</i>," said Bianchon; "and, upon my word, that name
 would do very well for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He
 turned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle.
 Michonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that
 strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature had
 dropped from the convict's face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that
 sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and hastily
 stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this scene in the
 least, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a pause. Just then
 there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there were soldiers there, it
 seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of the
 street. Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of
 escape, when four men entered by way of the sitting-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the name of the King and the Law!" said an officer, but the words were
 almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Silence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men, who
 had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two policemen, who
 followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two
 more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A
 sound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several
 soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window. All chance of
 salvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes
 instinctively turned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced
 operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell
 off, and Collin's face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was a
 terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short,
 brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful
 frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes.
 In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them
 all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless
 doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty
 with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the
 physical strength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood
 flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He
 started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations
 of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the police caught at
 their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Collin saw the gleaming
 muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a
 power of the highest order. There was something horrible and majestic in
 the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he could only be
 compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying, a
 terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of
 water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across
 his brain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are not in the politest of humors to-day," he remarked to the chief,
 and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," he said, "put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on
 those present to witness that I make no resistance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like
 fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden
 cessation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's a sell for you, master crusher," the convict added, looking at
 the famous director of police.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, strip!" said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" asked Collin. "There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and
 surrender."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to
 overwhelm his audience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle," he went on, addressing a little,
 white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and
 after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw up
 a document. "I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise known as
 Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years' penal servitude, and I have
 just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname.?If I had as much
 as raised my hand," he went on, addressing the other lodgers, "those three
 sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Vauquer's
 domestic hearth. The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap
 for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Lord!" she cried, "this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite
 with him only last night!" she said to Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Summon your philosophy, mamma," Collin resumed. "Is it a misfortune to
 have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are you
 better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the
 brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the
 core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me." His eyes rested
 upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed
 strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes.?"Our
 little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept any time you
 like! Do you understand?" And he sang:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "A charming girl is my Fanchette
 In her simplicity."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Don't you trouble yourself," he went on; "I can get in my money. They are
 too much afraid of me to swindle me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The convicts' prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp
 transitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur, its
 triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the speaker's
 discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of
 a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. In one
 moment Collin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all thoughts and
 passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. He looked
 about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. Rastignac
 lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an
 expiation of his own evil thoughts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who betrayed me?" said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the
 room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was you, old cat!" he said. "That sham stroke of apoplexy was your
 doing, lynx eyes!... Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in
 less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did not sell me
 either. But who did???Aha! you may rummage upstairs," he
 shouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking
 possession of his effects. "The nest is empty, the birds flew away
 yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here," he said
 tapping his forehead. "Now I know who sold me! It could only be that
 blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?" he said,
 turning to the chief. "It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up
 above there. There is nothing left for you?spies! As for
 Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even
 if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much did you
 give the Michonnette?" he asked of the police officers. "A thousand
 crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the
 graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me warning, you
 should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old
 trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have had the preference. Yes, I
 would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient
 journey and some loss of money," he said, as they fastened the handcuffs
 on his wrists. "These folks will amuse themselves by dragging out this
 business till the end of time to keep me idle. If they were to send me
 straight to jail, I should soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the
 duffers at the Quai des Orfevres. Down yonder they will all turn
 themselves inside out to help their general?their good
 Trompe-la-Mort?to get clear away. Is there a single one among you
 that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do
 anything for him?" he asked proudly. "There is some good there," he said
 tapping his heart; "I have never betrayed any one!?Look you here,
 you slut," he said to the old maid, "they are all afraid of me, do you
 see? but the sight of you turns them sick. Rake in your gains."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers' faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before? A
 convict of Collin's stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less
 weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud
 of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to
 declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against a Government
 and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and I am a match
 for them all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ye gods!" cried the painter, "what a magnificent sketch one might make of
 him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of
 ceremonies to the widow" (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by
 prisoners to the guillotine), "be a good fellow, and tell me if it really
 was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don't want him to suffer for some one else,
 that would not be fair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned
 from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had been opened and
 inventoried. A few words passed between them and the chief, and the
 official preliminaries were complete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," said Collin, addressing the lodgers, "they will take me away
 directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall
 look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and permit me to send
 you figs from Provence."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, Eugene," he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange
 transition from his previous rough and stern manner. "If you should be
 hard up, I have left you a devoted friend," and, in spite of his shackles,
 he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, "One, two!" like a
 fencing-master, and lunged. "If anything goes wrong, apply in that
 quarter. Man and money, all at your service."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The strange speaker's manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one
 but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the
 pantomime.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house,
 Sylvie, who was rubbing her mistress' temples with vinegar, looked round
 at the bewildered lodgers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said she, "he was a man, he was, for all that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much
 moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began to look
 at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle. Michonneau,
 a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure, crouching by the stove;
 her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could
 not shut out the expression of those faces from her. This figure and the
 feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at once. A
 smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as
 if the same feeling of loathing had pitched all the voices in one key.
 Mlle. Michonneau heard it, and did not stir. It was Bianchon who was the
 first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, "If
 that creature is going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall
 clear out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save
 Poiret, was of the medical student's opinion, so that the latter, strong
 in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us," he
 said; "speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at
 once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At once!" echoed Poiret in amazement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in her
 ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here
 as any one else," she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back," said
 Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur is taking Collin's part" she said, with a questioning, malignant
 glance at the law student; "it is not difficult to guess why."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and
 wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed,
 had been a hideous enlightenment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let her alone!" cried the boarders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac folded his arms and was silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas," said the painter, turning to Mme.
 Vauquer. "If you don't show the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall all
 leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only
 convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold our
 tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might happen
 in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when they send
 them to the hulks. They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised
 like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of
 rascally humbugs, which they are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her
 arms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir?
 There is M. Vautrin??Goodness," she cried, interrupting
 herself, "I can't help calling him by the name he passed himself off by
 for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to
 turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is
 moving??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux's in the
 Place Sorbonne," cried Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest
 lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Michonneau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, now," she said; "you would not be the ruin of my establishment,
 would you, eh? There's a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these
 gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never a bit of it!" cried the boarders. "She must go, and go this
 minute!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the poor lady has had no dinner," said Poiret, with piteous entreaty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She can go and dine where she likes," shouted several voices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Turn her out, the spy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Turn them both out! Spies!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen," cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that love
 gives to the ovine male, "respect the weaker sex."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Spies are of no sex!" said the painter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A precious sexorama!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Turn her into the streetorama!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house, it
 ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. We have
 paid our money, and we are not going," said Poiret, putting on his cap,
 and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme. Vauquer was
 remonstrating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Naughty boy!" said the painter, with a comical look; "run away, naughty
 little boy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here," said Bianchon; "if you do not go, all the rest of us will,"
 and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room-door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?" cried Mme. Vauquer. "I am a ruined
 woman. You can't stay here; they will go further, do something violent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is going!?She is not going!?She is going!?No, she
 isn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions,
 borne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. Michonneau to
 take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking in a low voice in
 her hostess' ear, and then?"I shall go to Mme. Buneaud's," she said,
 with a threatening look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go where you please, mademoiselle," said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded this
 choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. "Go and
 lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and the food
 is cheap and nasty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was
 spoken. Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so
 artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that
 the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau, burst out
 laughing at the sight of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hist!?st!?st! Poiret," shouted the painter. "Hallo! I say,
 Poiret, hallo!" The <i>employe</i> from the Museum began to sing:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Partant pour la Syrie,
 Le jeune et beau Dunois..."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Get along with you; you must be dying to go, <i>trahit sua quemque
 voluptas!</i>" said Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Every one to his taste?free rendering from Virgil," said the tutor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret's arm, with an
 appealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together, the
 old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause, followed by
 peals of laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bravo, Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who would have thought it of old Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Apollo Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mars Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Intrepid Poiret!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who
 read it through, and collapsed in her chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The house might as well be burned down at once," cried she, "if there are
 to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at three
 o'clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to those
 ladies at that poor man's expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine want me to
 send their things, because they are going to live with her father. M.
 Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture as her lady
 companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone!..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think," she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! another windfall for somebody!" was Sylvie's comment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with
 happiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goriot in a cab!" cried the boarders; "the world is coming to an end."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in
 thought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man's arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," he said, with gladness in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you haven't heard the news?" said Eugene. "Vautrin was an escaped
 convict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, but what business is it of ours?" replied Father Goriot. "I am
 going to dine with my daughter in <i>your house</i>, do you understand?
 She is expecting you. Come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as
 great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, let us have dinner," cried the painter, and every one drew his chair
 to the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I never," said the portly Sylvie. "Nothing goes right to-day! The
 haricot mutton has caught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as it is,
 more's the pity!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked
 round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should be; but
 every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner contingent,
 as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day's events; but the
 conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels, jails,
 justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in the laws.
 They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and Victorine and her
 brother. There might be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for
 twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them than usual; that was the
 only difference between yesterday and to-day. Indifference to the fate of
 others is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow
 of tragedy, seeks among the events of Paris for a fresh sensation for its
 daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper hand.
 Mme. Vauquer herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and
 the mouthpiece of hope was the portly Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of unreality
 lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character and
 clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Goriot in the
 cab. The old man's voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugene had
 been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears like
 words spoken in a dream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there
 together, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my Delphine,
 my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her for a whole
 evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. I have
 been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping to carry in the
 furniture. Aha! you don't know what pretty ways she has; at table she will
 look after me, 'Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.' And I shall not be
 able to eat. Oh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet
 every-day life as we shall have her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Upside down?" repeated Father Goriot. "Why, the world has never been so
 right-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who
 shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as happy
 as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice
 little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Cafe des
 Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and wormwood would be as
 sweet as honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel as if I were coming back to life again," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, hurry up there!" cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in
 front. "Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the place
 I told you of in ten minutes time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous
 celerity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How that fellow crawls!" said Father Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where are you taking me?" Eugene asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To your own house," said Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cab stopped in the Rue d'Artois. Father Goriot stepped out first and
 flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning
 to bachelor ways.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come along upstairs," he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard, and
 climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. There they
 stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was opened by
 Therese, Mme. de Nucingen's maid. Eugene found himself in a charming set
 of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study,
 looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the decorations of the little
 drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description, the room was
 full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair by the fire and
 stood before him. She set her fire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and
 spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to
 understand!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Therese left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held her
 in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last contrast
 between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just witnessed was
 too much for Rastignac's over-wrought nerves, after the day's strain and
 excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I felt sure myself that he loved you," murmured Father Goriot, while
 Eugene lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or
 to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring about
 this final transformation scene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you must see your rooms," said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his hand
 and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down
 to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of Delphine's
 apartment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is no bed," said Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, monsieur," she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Eugene,
 looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is
 implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever,"
 he said in her ear. "Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more
 mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since we
 understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose," growled the father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know quite well that 'we' means you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go and
 come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without being
 seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel?was it not a good
 idea of mine to say to you, 'There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue
 d'Artois; let us furnish them for him?' And she would not hear of it! Ah!
 your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of your happiness
 and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they would be
 happy themselves; always giving?they would not be fathers else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was that how it happened?" asked Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would talk,
 as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with
 happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen had
 led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though
 the sound was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was
 wanting there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have we guessed your wishes rightly?" she asked, as they returned to the
 drawing-room for dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," he said, "only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well carried
 out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all
 the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly that I cannot but
 feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you,
 and I am too poor as yet to??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! ah! you say me nay already," she said with arch imperiousness, and a
 charming little pout of the lips, a woman's way of laughing away scruples.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and
 Vautrin's arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay
 ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been
 strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into
 abandoning his high-minded determinations. Profound melancholy filled his
 mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you really mean to refuse?" said Mme. de Nucingen. "And do you know
 what such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself, that you do
 not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of betraying my
 affection? If you love me, if I?love you, why should you shrink back
 from such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has been
 to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment, you
 would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your
 hesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good
 use of it, that is all. You mean this for magnanimity, but it is very
 little of you. You are asking me for far more than this.... Ah!" she
 cried, as Eugene's passionate glance was turned on her, "and you are
 making difficulties about the merest trifles. Of, if you feel no love
 whatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you.
 Speak!?Father," she said after a pause, "make him listen to reason.
 Can he imagine that I am less nice than he is on the point of honor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a
 placid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Child that you are!" she cried again, catching Eugene's hand. "You are
 just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man finds
 insurmountable; a woman's hand opens the way and you shrink back! Why, you
 are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success is written
 on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my
 loan of to-day? Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight with sword
 and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might
 fight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Eugene, these things that I
 offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who means to be something
 must have such tools as these. A pretty place your garret must be if it is
 like papa's room! See, dinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to
 make me unhappy??Why don't you answer?" she said, shaking his hand.
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> papa, make up his mind for him, or I will go away and
 never see him any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will make up your mind," said Goriot, coming down from the clouds.
 "Now, my dear M. Eugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews,
 isn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is positively no help for it," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, I will give you credit," said the other, drawing out a cheap
 leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. "I have turned Jew myself; I
 paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a penny for
 anything here. It did not come to very much?five thousand francs at
 most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman?you
 can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you
 can return it some time or other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Delphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to
 their eyes. Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot's warmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! my poor father," said Mme. de Nucingen, "how did you do it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and
 saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself,
 'She will never be able to pay for them.' The attorney says that those law
 proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to
 disgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold out my property in the funds
 that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year, and bought a
 safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand francs.
 Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. As for me,
 children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I
 can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have something left
 over. I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear
 anything out. This fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve,
 thinking to myself, 'How happy they are going to be!' and?well, now,
 are you not happy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh papa! papa!" cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who took
 her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his
 cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright and
 radiant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father like
 you under the sun. If Eugene loved you before, what must he feel for you
 now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, children, why Delphinette!" cried Goriot, who had not felt his
 daughter's heart beat against his breast for ten years, "do you want me to
 die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur Eugene, we are quits
 already." And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and
 passionate force that she cried out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! you are hurting me!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am hurting you!" He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his
 face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The agony of
 this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of
 those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their
 visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men.
 Father Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the waist than his
 fingers had grasped too roughly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! no, no," he cried. "I have not hurt you, have I?" and his smile
 seemed to repeat the question. "YOU have hurt me with that cry just now.?The
 things cost rather more than that," he said in her ear, with another
 gentle kiss, "but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been
 angry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love;
 he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration which
 shapes the beliefs of youth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will be worthy of all this," he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! my Eugene, that is nobly said," and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the law
 student on the forehead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you," said Father Goriot.
 "Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her brother is
 dead she is as rich as Croesus."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! why did you tell her?" cried Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eugene," Delphine said in his ear, "I have one regret now this evening.
 Ah! how I will love you! and for ever!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!" cried
 Goriot. "God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through
 you, and I can still say, 'In this short month of February I had more
 happiness than other men have in their whole lives.'?Look at me,
 Fifine!" he said to his daughter. "She is very beautiful, is she not? Tell
 me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color?that
 little dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah, well, and but for me this
 lovely woman would never have been. And very soon happiness will make her
 a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. I could give up my place
 in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell instead.
 Come, let us have dinner," he added, scarcely knowing what he said,
 "everything is ours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor dear father!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a
 kiss on the plaits of hair. "If you only knew, little one, how happy you
 can make me?how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come and
 see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me,
 say that you will!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, dear father."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say it again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I will, my kind father."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed
 my own wishes. Let us have dinner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot's spirits
 were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter's feet, kissed
 them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her dress; in short, no
 young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see!" Delphine said with a look at Eugene, "so long as my father is
 with us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way sometimes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not
 blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And when will the rooms be ready?" asked Eugene, looking round. "We must
 all leave them this evening, I suppose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me," she answered, with an
 eloquent glance. "It is our night at the Italiens."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall go to the pit," said her father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen's carriage was waiting for her, and
 Father Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking
 of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious
 rivalry between the two violent passions. Eugene could not help seeing
 that the father's self-less love was deeper and more steadfast than his
 own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure and fair, and her
 father's adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future
 of love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep
 her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of
 Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and
 bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso's lamentations as
 recorded in Byron's poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of
 truth they fall far short of the widow's cry from the depths.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have your
 house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is life, now
 my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is just as if
 all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is
 your life. How have I offended heaven to draw down all this trouble upon
 me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people! The police
 in my house too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Christophe
 will have to go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said,
 "Madame," questioningly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor fellow!" said Sylvie, "he is like a dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know where
 the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And that old
 witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! What can she have
 done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a little
 dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord!" said Sylvie, flinging up her head, "those old maids are up to all
 sorts of tricks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict," the
 widow went on. "Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I can't
 bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and paid fifteen
 francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny on the
 nail too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And open-handed he was!" said Christophe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is some mistake," said Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, no there isn't! he said so himself!" said Mme. Vauquer. "And to
 think that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter
 where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest woman, it's like
 a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with his mishap; we saw
 the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there
 was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not liable
 to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same;
 and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you
 all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the end of the world
 ought to?but there, it is the end of the world, that is just what it
 is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to have
 a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear," cried Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't speak of her, she is a wicked woman!" said Mme. Vauquer. "She is
 going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud is
 capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed and
 murdered people in her time. <i>She</i> ought to be put in jail for life
 instead of that poor dear??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers," said the widow, sighing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of
 the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess without
 more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee d'Antin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sylvie!" cried the widow, "this is the last straw.?Gentlemen, this
 will be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There's a weight on my
 chest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out of
 my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!?Oh, well, if I
 am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow, Christophe.?Good-night,
 gentlemen," and she went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter now?" Eugene inquired of Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her
 wits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a bit.
 It's the first time she has cried since I've been with her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had "made up her
 mind to it." True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might be
 expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner of life
 had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. Her
 grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse
 had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. A lover's
 farewell glance at his lady-love's window is not more mournful than Mme.
 Vauquer's survey of the empty places round her table. Eugene administered
 comfort, telling the widow that Bianchon, whose term of residence at the
 hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his (Rastignac's)
 place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to
 have Mme. Couture's rooms; and that in a very few days her household would
 be on the old footing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here.
 There'll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you'll see," and
 she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. "Whose turn will it be,
 I wonder?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is just as well that we are moving out," said Eugene to Father Goriot
 in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, "I have not seen
 Mistigris these three days."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if <i>he</i> has gone and left us, I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and
 hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful
 portent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By twelve o'clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene received
 a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Beauseant arms on the seal, and
 contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse's great ball, which had been
 talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Eugene was slipped in
 with the card.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to
 interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Nucingen, so I am sending the
 card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make
 the acquaintance of Mme. de Restaud's sister. Pray introduce that
 charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your
 affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.

 "VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT."
</pre>
 <p>
 "Well," said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time, "Mme.
 de Beauseant says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de
 Nucingen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure for
 her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de Nucingen was
 dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as best he might the
 natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and
 withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known once in a life. The
 first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really a woman?that is
 to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a
 necessary background to life in the world of Paris?will never have a
 rival.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Love in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor
 women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to throw a
 veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of
 disinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country,
 it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses
 and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater
 obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a
 vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called
 society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a
 vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If at
 the Court of Louis XIV. there was not a woman but envied Mlle. de la
 Valliere the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to
 tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a
 Duc de Vermandois into the world?what can you expect of the rest of
 society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if
 possible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to
 burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the
 worshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things
 be more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for
 a moment, and then passes on; like the urchin of the streets, his course
 may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of feeling and
 imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there
 without that wealth?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of
 the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so far out
 of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines of
 society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water, without
 seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the
 infinite in everything around them and in their own souls, waiting in
 patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look with pity upon
 those of earth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the
 circumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed;
 the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps he was
 conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his
 ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. In default of
 the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may become something
 very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and
 setting as the end?the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole
 nation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys
 the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had
 scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious
 influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and
 grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite
 of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering tradition of
 an old ideal?the peaceful life of the noble in his chateau. But
 yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those scruples had vanished.
 He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of fortune, as
 he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a
 provincial from that moment, and slipped naturally and easily into a
 position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that
 he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the
 Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of
 inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self
 bore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame is in her room," Therese came to tell him. The woman's voice made
 him start.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking
 fresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin
 suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid the
 blossom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," she said, with a tremor in her voice, "here you are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Guess what I bring for you," said Eugene, sitting down beside her. He
 took possession of her arm to kiss her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned to
 Eugene; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck,
 and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I owe this happiness to you?to <i>thee</i>" (she whispered the
 more intimate word in his ear); "but Therese is in my dressing-room, let
 us be prudent.?This happiness?yes, for I may call it so, when
 it comes to me through <i>you</i>?is surely more than a triumph for
 self-love? No one has been willing to introduce me into that set. Perhaps
 just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a
 Parisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for
 you; and that if I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg
 Saint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mme. de Beauseant's note seems to say very plainly that she does not
 expect to see the <i>Baron</i> de Nucingen at her ball; don't you think
 so?" said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, yes," said the Baroness as she returned the letter. "Those women
 have a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go. My
 sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully dressed.?Eugene,"
 she went on, lowering her voice, "she will go to dispel ugly suspicions.
 You do not know the things that people are saying about her. Only this
 morning Nucingen came to tell me that they had been discussing her at the
 club. Great heavens! on what does a woman's character and the honor of a
 whole family depend! I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in my
 poor sister. According to some people, M. de Trailles must have put his
 name to bills for a hundred thousand francs, nearly all of them are
 overdue, and proceedings are threatened. In this predicament, it seems
 that my sister sold her diamonds to a Jew?the beautiful diamonds
 that belonged to her husband's mother, Mme. de Restaud the elder,?you
 have seen her wearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about
 for the last two days. So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme.
 de Beauseant's ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw
 all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to eclipse me
 all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so
 often, and always had money for her when she had none.?But never
 mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At one o'clock that morning Eugene was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In the
 midst of their lovers' farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come,
 she said in a troubled voice, "I am very fearful, superstitious. Give what
 name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will
 be paid for by some horrible catastrophe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Child!" said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?" she asked,
 laughingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should
 leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the
 bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left its sweetness
 on the lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Eugene; "I will tell you everything to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything, will you not?" cried the old man. "Go to bed. To-morrow our
 happy life will begin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house, and
 only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards
 noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a
 carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. Mme. de Nucingen
 alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving
 an affirmative reply from Sylvie, ran lightly upstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At
 breakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of his
 goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d'Artois at four o'clock;
 but Rastignac's name had been called early on the list at the Ecole de
 Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No
 one had seen him come in, for Goriot had gone to find a porter, and the
 mistress of the house was likewise out. Eugene had thought to pay her
 himself, for it struck him that if he left this, Goriot in his zeal would
 probably pay for him. As it was, Eugene went up to his room to see that
 nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw the
 blank bill bearing Vautrin's signature lying in the drawer where he had
 carelessly thrown it on the day when he had repaid the amount. There was
 no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces, when
 he heard a voice speaking in Goriot's room, and the speaker was Delphine!
 He made no more noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should
 have no secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation
 between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it
 absorbed all his attention.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the
 money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe to
 talk?" she added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, there is no one in the house," said her father faintly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter with you?" asked Mme. de Nucingen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!" said
 the old man. "You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have
 burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not lost.
 Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? In a
 few minutes we should have been in the Rue d'Artois."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned
 my head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it was
 bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long business
 experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch.
 When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of
 difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told him
 plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the
 Tribunal. So Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant
 to ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that I
 had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that
 my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew
 absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the subject
 with him. Wasn't that what you told me to tell him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, quite right," answered Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," Delphine continued, "he told me all about his affairs. He
 had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations; they
 have only just been started, and very large sums of money are locked up.
 If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file
 his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to
 double or treble my fortune, by investing it in building land, and I shall
 be mistress at last of the whole of my property. He was speaking the
 truth, father dear; he frightened me! He asked my pardon for his conduct;
 he has given me my liberty; I am free to act as I please on condition that
 I leave him to carry on my business in my name. To prove his sincerity, he
 promised that M. Derville might inspect the accounts as often as I
 pleased, so that I might be assured that everything was being conducted
 properly. In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He
 wishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to
 continue for two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance.
 He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up
 appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to
 practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his time
 with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him to
 desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers?he
 broke down and cried at last. I never saw a man in such a state. He lost
 his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt
 quite sorry for him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you really believe that silly rubbish?"... cried her father. "It was
 all got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in the way of
 business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but when
 with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well,
 they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is taking advantage of you.
 As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams dead; he means to
 be more the master under your name than in his own. He will take advantage
 of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. He is as
 sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to
 leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go to Pere-Lachaise. I
 know something about business still. He has sunk his money in speculation,
 he says; very well then, there is something to show for it?bills,
 receipts, papers of some sort. Let him produce them, and come to an
 arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising of his
 speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities
 transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate estate of
 Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that fellow really
 take us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your
 being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? I would not
 stand it a day?no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had
 been any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I have
 worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and sweated and
 pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you who made the
 toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my
 whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I should die raving mad if I believed a
 word of it. By all that's holiest in heaven and earth, we will have this
 cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked
 thoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have
 satisfied myself that all your fortune is in existence. Your money is
 settled upon you, God be thanked! and, luckily, your attorney, Maitre
 Derville, is an honest man. Good Lord! you shall have your snug little
 million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as long as you live, or I will
 raise a racket in Paris, I will so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will
 appeal to the Chambers. If I knew that you were well and comfortably off
 as far as money is concerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of
 bad health and troubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything.
 That great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here,
 Delphine, don't give way, don't make a concession of half a quarter of a
 farthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you miserable.
 If he can't do without you, we will give him a good cudgeling, and keep
 him in order. Great heavens! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were
 something redhot inside my head. My Delphine lying on straw! You! my
 Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once; I
 mean to see everything with my own eyes?books, cash, and
 correspondence, the whole business. I shall have no peace until I know for
 certain that your fortune is secure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least
 hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile, it
 will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal with; he thinks it
 quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy
 about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and
 that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to abscond with all the
 money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows quite well that I
 will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. His
 position is strong and weak at the same time. If we drive him to despair,
 I am lost."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, then, the man is a rogue?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, yes, father," she said, flinging herself into a chair, "I wanted to
 keep it from you to spare your feelings," and she burst into tears; "I did
 not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as he is. He is
 just the same in private life?body and soul and conscience?the
 same through and through?hideous! I hate him; I despise him! Yes,
 after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I cannot respect him
 any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of
 talking about them to me as he did, without the slightest scruple,?it
 is because I have read him through and through that I am afraid of him.
 He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know
 what that means? It means that if things turn out badly for him, I am to
 play into his hands, and be his stalking-horse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law of
 that sort," cried her father; "why, I would guillotine him myself if there
 was no headsman to do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says,
 stripped of all his circumlocutions?'Take your choice, you and no
 one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined
 and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through
 myself.' Is that plain speaking? He <i>must</i> have my assistance. He is
 assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall leave
 his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and dishonest
 compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it.
 He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to be Eugene's wife
 in all but name. 'I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit
 crimes and ruin poor families!' Is that sufficiently explicit? Do you know
 what he means by speculations? He buys up land in his own name, then he
 finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These men make a bargain with
 a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then
 in consideration of a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the
 houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by
 going into bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to
 dazzle the poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Nucingen had
 sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in
 order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid away by the
 firm. How could we get possession of those bills?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen on
 his knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this
 scoundrel who does as he likes with her!?Oh! my child, my child!
 forgive me!" cried the old man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame," said
 Delphine. "We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know of the
 world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think for us!
 Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I
 said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa," she said, kissing
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away the
 tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your
 husband's winding."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me, well
 and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as soon as
 possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I could get him to
 buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of
 his. Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the
 business. M. Derville knows little of mercantile matters. No, not
 to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Beauseant's ball will
 be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best
 and freshest, and do honor to my dear Eugene!... Come, let us see his
 room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and
 the sound of Mme. de Restaud's voice came from the staircase. "Is my
 father in?" she asked of Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to
 throw himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?" said Delphine, when she
 heard her sister speak. "It looks as though some strange things had
 happened in that family."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What sort of things?" asked Goriot. "This is like to be the death of me.
 My poor head will not stand a double misfortune."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning, father," said the Countess from the threshold. "Oh!
 Delphine, are you here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister's presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-morning, Nasie," said the Baroness. "What is there so extraordinary
 in my being here? <i>I</i> see our father every day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Since when?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you came yourself you would know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't tease, Delphine," said the Countess fretfully. "I am very
 miserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it, Nasie?" cried Goriot. "Tell us all about it, child! How white
 she is! Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will love you
 even better, if that were possible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Nasie!" said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. "We
 are the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to
 forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess inhaled the salts and revived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This will kill me!" said their father. "There," he went on, stirring the
 smouldering fire, "come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it,
 Nasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, my husband knows everything," said the Countess. "Just
 imagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime's some time ago?
 Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before that. About
 the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled. He said
 nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a
 mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively. Indeed, he
 was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I had
 ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself he was really saying good-bye to
 me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his brains out! At last I
 worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two hours I knelt at
 his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me?that he
 owed a hundred thousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was
 beside myself! You had not the money, I knew, I had eaten up all that you
 had??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Goriot; "I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen
 it. But I would have done that for you, Nasie! I will do it yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death rattle
 of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when the father's
 love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the sisters spoke.
 It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of
 anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths
 of his despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell," and the
 Countess burst into tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Delphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister's shoulder, and
 cried too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it is all true," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Anastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her,
 kissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My angels," murmured Goriot faintly. "Oh, why should it be trouble that
 draws you together?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To save Maxime's life," she said, "to save all my own happiness, I went
 to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire;
 nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Restaud is
 so proud of?his and mine too?and sold them to that M. Gobseck.
 <i>Sold them!</i> Do you understand? I saved Maxime, but I am lost.
 Restaud found it all out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How? Who told him? I will kill him," cried Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went. ...
 'Anastasie,' he said in a voice?oh! such a voice; that was enough,
 it told me everything?'where are your diamonds?'?'In my room??'?'No,'
 he said, looking straight at me, 'there they are on that chest of drawers??'
 and he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket. 'Do you know
 where they came from?' he said. I fell at his feet.... I cried; I besought
 him to tell me the death he wished to see me die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You said that!" cried Goriot. "By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on
 either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow
 fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Goriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven
 preserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will murder that man," said Goriot quietly. "But he has only one life,
 and he deserves to die twice.?And then, what next?" he added,
 looking at Anastasie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then," the Countess resumed, "there was a pause, and he looked at me.
 'Anastasie,' he said, 'I will bury this in silence; there shall be no
 separation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I
 might miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him,
 I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in your arms,
 it would bring dishonor on <i>those</i> children. But if you do not want
 to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of
 all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child of my own?' I
 answered, 'Yes,'?'Which?'?'Ernest, our eldest boy.'?'Very
 well,' he said, 'and now swear to obey me in this particular from this
 time forward.' I swore. 'You will make over your property to me when I
 require you to do so.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do nothing of the kind!" cried Goriot. "Aha! M. de Restaud, you could not
 make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere,
 and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? He will have to reckon
 with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about his heir! Good,
 very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn't he my grandson? What the
 blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will stow him away somewhere; I
 will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring Restaud to
 terms, the monster! I shall say to him, 'A word or two with you! If you
 want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and leave her to
 do as she pleases.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great lord
 had better not ill-treat my daughter. <i>Tonnerre!</i> What is it in my
 veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men to
 pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why, it is
 death!... What will become of you when I shall be here no longer? Fathers
 ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord God in heaven! how ill
 Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and
 yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. My darlings, my
 darlings! to think that trouble only should bring you to me, that I should
 only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes, you love me, I see
 that you love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is
 large enough to hold them all. Oh! you might rend my heart in pieces, and
 every fragment would make a father's heart. If only I could bear all your
 sorrows for you! ... Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still
 with me...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have never been happy since," said Delphine. "Where are the old days
 when we slid down the sacks in the great granary?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is not all, father," said Anastasie in Goriot's ear. The old man
 gave a startled shudder. "The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand
 francs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand francs still to
 pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in
 future. His love is all that I have left in the world. I have paid such a
 fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I have
 sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for
 him. Oh! do something, so that at the least Maxime may be at large and
 live undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for
 himself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have
 nothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be
 ruined."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I haven't the money, Nasie. I have <i>nothing</i>?nothing left.
 This is the end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am
 sure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!?I have still my silver buckles left,
 and half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life.
 But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred francs..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what has become of your money in the funds?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve thousand
 francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In your own house?" asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does it matter where they were?" asked Goriot. "The money is spent
 now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see how it is," said the Countess. "Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor
 Delphine, take warning by me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my
 troubles, but you never did love me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie," cried Goriot; "she was saying so only
 just now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were
 beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pretty!" said the Countess. "She is as hard as a marble statue."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And if I am?" cried Delphine, flushing up, "how have you treated me? You
 would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against me;
 you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. And when did I
 come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand
 francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? That is all your
 doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as often as I could. I have
 not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I
 wanted money. I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve
 thousand francs on me. I am economical, as you know; and when papa has
 made me presents, it has never been because I came and begged for them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason to
 know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither sister
 nor??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!" cried her father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are an
 unnatural sister!" cried Delphine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your
 eyes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, Nasie, I forgive you," said Mme. de Nucingen; "you are very
 unhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say <i>that</i> just
 when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be
 reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I??Oh! it is
 just like you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine
 years."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Children, children, kiss each other!" cried the father. "You are angels,
 both of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Let me alone," cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her
 father had laid on her arm. "She is more merciless than my husband. Any
 one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay than
 own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand
 francs," retorted Mme. de Nucingen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Delphine!</i>" cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me,"
 said the Baroness coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Delphine! you are a ??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Father Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess' hand, and laid
 his own over her mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?" said
 Anastasie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you," said the poor father,
 wiping his hands on his trousers, "but I have been packing up my things; I
 did not know that you were coming to see me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" he sighed, as he sat down, "you children have broken my heart
 between you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire. Be
 good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of me!
 Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come,
 Dedel," he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, "she must
 have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for
 her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!" and he sank on
 his knees beside Delphine. "Ask her to forgive you?just to please
 me," he said in her ear. "She is more miserable than you are. Come now,
 Dedel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Nasie!" said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her
 father's face, "I was in the wrong, kiss me??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! that is like balm to my heart," cried Father Goriot. "But how are we
 to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a substitute in
 the army??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! father dear!" they both cried, flinging their arms about him. "No,
 no!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?"
 asked Delphine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket,"
 observed the Countess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But is flesh and blood worth nothing?" cried the old man in his despair.
 "I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. I would do a murder for
 the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin did, go to the hulks,
 go??" he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both
 hands to his head. "Nothing left!" he cried, tearing his hair. "If I only
 knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and then you
 can't set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. Yes, it is
 time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. I am no good
 in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come to me in her
 extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah! you put
 your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters?
 You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that you are!
 Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done!
 Oh! my head... it throbs as if it would burst."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Papa!" cried both the young women at once, "do, pray, be reasonable!" and
 they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the wall.
 There was a sound of sobbing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin's signature, saw
 that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made
 it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to Goriot's
 order, and went to his neighbor's room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is the money, madame," he said, handing the piece of paper to her.
 "I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all
 that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be discounted, and I shall meet it
 punctually at the due date."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her
 fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Delphine," she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering
 with indignation, anger, and rage, "I forgave you everything; God is my
 witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this gentleman
 was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has let you to
 wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children's
 lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing to me any longer. I hate
 you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Anger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!" cried
 Goriot. "Kiss his hand, Nasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself," he said,
 straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. "Oh my boy! I will be
 more than a father to you; if I had God's power, I would fling worlds at
 your feet. Why don't you kiss him, Nasie? He is not a man, but an angel, a
 angel out of heaven."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind her, father; she is mad just now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mad! am I? And what are you?" cried Mme. de Restaud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this," cried the old
 man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck him.?"They
 are killing me between them," he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his
 faculties were numbed by this violent scene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir?..." she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she
 took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was hastily
 unfastening his waistcoat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, "I will
 meet the bill, and keep silence about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have killed our father, Nasie!" said Delphine, pointing to Goriot,
 who lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I freely forgive her," said the old man, opening his eyes; "her position
 is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort Nasie, and be
 nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father before he dies," he
 asked, holding Delphine's hand in a convulsive clasp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! what ails you, father?" she cried in real alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing, nothing," said Goriot; "it will go off. There is something heavy
 pressing on my forehead, a little headache.... Ah! poor Nasie, what a life
 lies before her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her
 knees before him. "Forgive me!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," said her father, "you are hurting me still more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur," the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, "misery made me
 unjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?" and she held
 out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nasie," cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, "my little
 Nasie, let us forget and forgive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no," cried Nasie; "I shall never forget!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear angels," cried Goriot, "it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had
 been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each other once
 more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all well,
 Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me know as
 soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you. No, after all, I
 will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot.
 And as for signing away your property, I shall have a word to say about
 that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in future."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was too bewildered to speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper," said Mme. de Nucingen,
 "but she has a good heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She came back for the endorsement," said Eugene in Delphine's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her," he answered,
 raising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did not
 venture to express.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot?" asked Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to go to sleep," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his
 hand until he fell asleep. Then she went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This evening at the Italiens," she said to Eugene, "and you can let me
 know how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go
 into your room.?Oh! how frightful!" she cried on the threshold.
 "Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. Eugene, you have behaved
 well. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you
 are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand
 francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed
 gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made the twelve
 thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps of gold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot's bedside; to all
 appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, "They are
 not happy!" Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they were
 spoken went to his daughter's heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed on
 which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Delphine!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you now?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. Don't
 stay with me, children; go, go and be happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy
 about Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted to
 be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Goriot had left his room, and was
 just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed himself
 where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli
 maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out the quality
 of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the
 action was purely mechanical, and shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him
 next to the old lodger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is wrong with him?" asked Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very
 extraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in
 imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is composed
 enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there is that
 peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the
 brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine dust, do
 you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there any cure for it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could
 be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the
 symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with him,
 poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on? There
 must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, there was," said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had
 struck blow on blow at their father's heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Delphine at any rate loves her father," he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he
 should give Mme. de Nucingen needless alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not be anxious about him," she said, however, as soon as Eugene began,
 "our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him
 a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was serious, you
 see. I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to
 troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear. At this moment
 I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread?to lose the love
 that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as nothing to me
 compared with our love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world
 to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake. To my shame be it
 said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell
 you, but all my life is in you. My father gave me a heart, but you have
 taught it to beat. The whole world may condemn me; what does it matter if
 I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me
 for the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do
 you think me an unnatural daughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such
 a dear kind father as ours. But how could I hide the inevitable
 consequences of our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to
 marry when we did? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us?
 To-day I know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? And
 as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our
 resignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints
 and upbraidings. There are times in life when everything turns to
 bitterness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression
 on him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Parisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and
 self-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love,
 they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but so
 much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become
 sublime. Then Eugene was struck by the profound discernment and insight
 displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a privileged
 affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme. de Nucingen
 was piqued by the silence,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you thinking about?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt
 sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their
 talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had never
 heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more
 words, and she feared for her self-control.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eugene," she said, changing the conversation, "I wonder whether you know
 what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauseant's
 to-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d'Ajuda have agreed to keep the
 matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the
 marriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it
 as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be there.
 People are wondering what will happen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill Mme.
 de Beauseant."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no," said Delphine, smiling, "you do not know that kind of woman.
 Why, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for your
 sake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in
 circulation here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We shall know the truth to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the
 pleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d'Artois. Yesterday evening
 he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but that night
 it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o'clock in the morning. He
 rose late, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came about noon to
 breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments of
 happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot's existence. The pretty
 things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in
 itself was one long festival for him, and Mme. de Nucingen was there to
 glorify it all by her presence. It was four o'clock before they thought of
 Goriot, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house.
 Eugene said that the old man ought to be moved at once, lest he should
 grow too ill to move. He left Delphine and hurried back to the
 lodging-house. Neither Father Goriot nor young Bianchon was in the
 dining-room with the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha!" said the painter as Eugene came in, "Father Goriot has broken down
 at last. Bianchon is upstairs with him. One of his daughters?the
 Comtesse de Restaurama?came to see the old gentleman, and he would
 get up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of
 its brightest ornaments."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac sprang to the staircase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey! Monsieur Eugene!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you," shouted Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is this, sir," said the widow. "You and M. Goriot should by rights
 have moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago; to-day is
 the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you will
 engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why can't you trust him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those
 daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won't fetch
 ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons and forks he has
 left, I don't know why. He had got himself up to look quite young, and?Lord,
 forgive me?but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite
 young again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will be responsible," said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he
 foresaw the end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot's room. The old man was
 tossing on his bed. Bianchon was with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-evening, father," said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is <i>she</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is quite well. But how are you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is nothing much the matter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't tire him," said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" asked Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in; I
 have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are
 acting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it possible to move him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet
 as possible??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear Bianchon," said Eugene, "we will nurse him between us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what did he say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in
 again at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous creature must
 needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it
 was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him he
 pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of answering,
 or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time this morning he went
 out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took
 everything that he had of any value with him. He has been driving some
 confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his strength. One of his
 daughters has been here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was it the Countess?" asked Eugene. "A tall, dark-haired woman, with
 large bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave him to me for a bit," said Rastignac. "I will make him confess; he
 will tell me all about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is
 still some hope left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow," said Father Goriot when they
 were alone. "They are going to a grand ball."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this
 evening that you have to stop in bed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did not Anastasie come to see you?" demanded Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Father Goriot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, don't keep anything from me. What more did she want of you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, she was very miserable," he answered, gathering up all his strength
 to speak. "It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds,
 Nasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had ordered a
 golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a woman without a
 conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie's waiting-woman advanced a
 thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie! reduced to such shifts! It cut me
 to the heart to think of it! But when Nasie's maid saw how things were
 between her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and
 came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and the woman refuses to
 send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The gown is ready, and the
 ball is to-morrow night! Nasie was in despair. She wanted to borrow my
 forks and spoons to pawn them. Her husband is determined that she shall go
 and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all
 over Paris. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, 'I owe a
 thousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!' She cannot. I saw that
 myself. Delphine will be there too in a superb toilette, and Anastasie
 ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. And then?she was
 drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not
 the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest of my
 miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have borne
 anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. Oh! I
 did not do it by halves; I titivated myself up a bit, and went out and
 sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs; then I went
 to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year's interest on my annuity for four
 hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a
 young man; if I have done it before, I can do it again. My Nasie shall
 have one happy evening, at any rate. She shall be smart. The banknote for
 a thousand francs is under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there
 under my head, for it is going to make my poor Nasie happy. She can turn
 that bad girl Victoire out of the house. A servant that cannot trust her
 mistress, did any one ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow.
 Nasie is coming at ten o'clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they
 will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow
 Nasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children;
 her kisses will make me well again. After all, I might have spent the
 thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little
 Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to
 her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an
 annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. Oh!
 I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there,
 wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law
 against the importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law
 forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made
 from corn. Hey! hey!... That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade
 to be done in starch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene, watching the old man's face, thought that his friend was
 light-headed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," he said, "do not talk any more, you must rest??" Just
 then Bianchon came up, and Eugene went down to dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn.
 Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugene wrote letters
 home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon thought the symptoms
 more hopeful, but the patient's condition demanded continual attention,
 which the two students alone were willing to give?a task impossible
 to describe in the squeamish phraseology of the epoch. Leeches must be
 applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other
 details of the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of
 the two young men. Mme. de Restaud did not come; but she sent a messenger
 for the money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her
 to come, she would have been anxious about me," said the father, and to
 all appearances he was well content.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At seven o'clock that evening Therese came with a letter from Delphine.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very
 little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of
 heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul?you are too
 noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all
 its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. Once you
 said, as we were listening to the Prayer in <i>Mose in Egitto</i>, 'For
 some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the
 infinite of sound.' Remember that I am expecting you this evening
 to take me to Mme. de Beauseant's ball. Every one knows now that
 the King signed M. d'Ajuda's marriage-contract this morning, and
 the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o'clock this
 afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a
 crowd fills the Place de Greve to see an execution. It is
 horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will
 hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? I
 certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house
 before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more
 after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. My position is a
 very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your
 account. I am waiting for you. If you are not beside me in less
 than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such
 treason."
</pre>
 <p>
 Rastignac took up a pen and wrote:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of
 your father's life. He is lying dangerously ill. I will come and
 bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death.
 When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.?Yours
 a thousand times."
</pre>
 <p>
 At half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful view
 of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger. Improvements
 and relapses might be expected, and the good man's life and reason hung in
 the balance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would be better for him to die at once," the doctor said as he took
 leave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene left Goriot to Bianchon's care, and went to carry the sad news to
 Mme. de Nucingen. Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put an end
 for the present to her plans of amusement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened," cried Goriot.
 He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as
 Eugene went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine's. Her hair had been dressed;
 she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but
 when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the last
 touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you are not dressed!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, your father??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My father again!" she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. "You need not
 teach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long while.
 Not a word, Eugene. I will hear what you have to say when you are dressed.
 My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Therese
 has put out everything in readiness for you. Come back as soon as you can;
 we will talk about my father on the way to Mme. de Beauseant's. We must go
 early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall be
 lucky if we get there by eleven o'clock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick! not a word!" she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a
 necklace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame," said Therese, hurrying
 him away; and Eugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to
 resist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The
 world of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed
 that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to the
 chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Their crimes are paltry," said Eugene to himself. "Vautrin was greater."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had seen society in its three great phases?Obedience, Struggle,
 and Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his
 choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous. His
 thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet
 uneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who
 loved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in
 obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a
 deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet, for
 all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession of
 the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties of
 piety to her in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its
 fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his tact had discovered to
 him the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was
 capable of stepping over her father's corpse to go to the ball; and within
 himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play the part
 of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to
 leave her to go alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it," he said
 to himself. Then he turned the doctor's dictum over in his mind; he tried
 to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had imagined, and
 ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses
 for Delphine's conduct. She did not know how ill her father was; the kind
 old man himself would have made her go to the ball if she had gone to see
 him. So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the
 social laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar
 circumstances in the case, differences of temperament, divergent
 interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the
 apparent offence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his
 conscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life had
 undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into
 chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all
 his being to her uses. Rastignac and Delphine found each other at a crisis
 in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant bliss. Their
 passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified
 desire that often extinguishes passion. This woman was his, and Eugene
 recognized that not until then had he loved her; perhaps love is only
 gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the
 pleasure she had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved Rastignac as
 Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his hunger and
 quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, "how is
 my father?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very dangerously ill," he answered; "if you will grant me a proof of your
 affections, we will just go in to see him on the way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," she said. "Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugene, do be nice, and
 don't preach to me. Come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They set out. Eugene said nothing for a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it now?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can hear the death-rattle in your father's throat," he said almost
 angrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of Mme.
 de Restaud's vanity and cruelty, of her father's final act of
 self-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and
 death, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie's golden
 embroideries. Delphine cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall look frightful," she thought. She dried her tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside," she said aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! now you are as I would have you," exclaimed Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel de
 Beauseant. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side
 of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was flocking thither that
 night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her
 fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing,
 when Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac appeared. Never since Louis XIV. tore
 her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and the whole court hastened to
 visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a
 sensation in Paris. But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of
 Burgundy had risen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment
 like a queen in this world?its vanities had always been valueless
 for her, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion.
 The salons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent
 in their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and ambassadors,
 the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with decorations,
 stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious names in France, had
 gathered about the Vicomtesse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the
 golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the
 guests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and wore no
 ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was calm;
 there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not
 feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved
 in marble. For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of satire in her
 smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise
 in the days of the glory of her happiness. The most callous of her guests
 admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator who could die smiling.
 It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last audience of one of
 its sovereigns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was afraid that you would not come," she said to Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame," he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach,
 "I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good," she said, and she took his hand. "You are perhaps the only one I
 can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman
 whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took Rastignac's arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want you to go to the Marquis," she said. "Jacques, my footman, will go
 with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis to
 give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I like to think
 that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Some one shall
 bring me word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate friend,
 who had come like the rest of the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d'Ajuda at the Hotel Rochefide,
 feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and
 so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with Rastignac, and gave a
 casket to the student, saying as he did so, "They are all there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask about the
 ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession
 that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his marriage had been a
 fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable
 courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene." He grasped
 Rastignac's hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him.
 Eugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him to the
 Vicomtesse's room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey.
 He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and fell
 into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauseant loomed large in these
 imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my friend!..." said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her
 hand on Rastignac's shoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin's uplifted
 eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that the
 fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the
 fire, and watched it burn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are dancing," she said. "They all came very early; but death will be
 long in coming. Hush! my friend," and she laid a finger on Rastignac's
 lips, seeing that he was about to speak. "I shall never see Paris again. I
 am taking my leave of the world. At five o'clock this morning I shall set
 out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy.
 I have had very little time to make my arrangements; since three o'clock
 this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in
 order; there was no one whom I could send to..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She broke off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was sure to be..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could
 bear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are
 impossible to utter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this
 evening," she said. "I should like to give you some pledge of friendship.
 I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind and noble,
 fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom
 found. I should like you to think sometimes of me. Stay," she said,
 glancing about her, "there is this box that has held my gloves. Every time
 I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that
 I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never touched it except
 to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much of my old self in it,
 of a Madame de Beauseant who now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will
 leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d'Artois.?Mme.
 de Nucingen looked very charming this evening. Eugene, you must love her.
 Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this,
 that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.?Now, let us go
 downstairs. People shall not think that I am weeping. I have all time and
 eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no one will
 ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an
 instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took
 the student's arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us go!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with a
 more violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the
 ballroom, and Mme. de Beauseant went through the rooms on Eugene's arm?the
 last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another moment he saw
 the sisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The Countess shone in
 all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone must have scorched
 like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong as love and pride
 might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband's eyes. The
 sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten Rastignac's sad thoughts;
 through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched
 pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was lying. The Vicomtesse misread his
 melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," she said, "I must not deprive you of a pleasure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted by the impression
 that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover's feet the homage she had
 received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move henceforth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you think of Nasie?" she asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She has discounted everything, even her own father's death," said
 Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards four o'clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little
 later the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were
 left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the
 student there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave of M. de
 Beauseant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, "It is a
 great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray stay among us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mme. de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an
 exclamation broke from her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I saw how it was, Clara," said Mme. de Langeais. "You are going from
 among us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you have
 heard me, until we have understood each other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took her friend's arm, and they went together into the next room.
 There the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her
 friend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have
 been too hard to bear. You can count upon me as surely as upon yourself.
 You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am worthy of our
 friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I have not always
 been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I could unsay
 anything that may have hurt you; I take back those words. One common
 sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which of us is the
 more miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here to-night; do you understand
 what that means??None of those who saw you to-night, Clara, will
 ever forget you. I mean to make one last effort. If I fail, I shall go
 into a convent. Clara, where are you going?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the day
 when God shall take me from this world.?M. de Rastignac!" called the
 Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man was
 waiting there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student knelt to kiss his cousin's hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, Antoinette!" said Mme. de Beauseant. "May you be happy."?She
 turned to the student. "You are young," she said; "you have some beliefs
 still left. I have been privileged, like some dying people, to find
 sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of this
 world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was nearly five o'clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He had
 put Mme. de Beauseant into her traveling carriage, and received her last
 farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness is so great
 that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond the
 jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have the people believe.
 Eugene returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer through the cold and
 darkness. His education was nearly complete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is no hope for poor Father Goriot," said Bianchon, as Rastignac
 came into the room. Eugene looked for a while at the sleeping man, then he
 turned to his friend. "Dear fellow, you are content with the modest career
 you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in hell, and I must
 stay there. Believe everything that you hear said of the world, nothing is
 too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint the horrors hidden away under
 the covering of gems and gold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At two o'clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and
 begged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore
 on. The medical student was obliged to go out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours," he
 said; "but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease. It
 will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. We can nurse him
 between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. I have
 turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his drawers?result,
 nix. I asked him about it while his mind was clear, and he told me he had
 not a farthing of his own. What have you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have twenty francs left," said Rastignac; "but I will take them to the
 roulette table, I shall be sure to win."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And if you lose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for
 money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And suppose they refuse?" Bianchon retorted. "The most pressing thing
 just now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as
 they can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out, there is still
 some hope for him. You know how to set about doing it, and besides,
 Christophe will help you. I am going round to the dispensary to persuade
 them to let us have the things we want on credit. It is a pity that we
 could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better there.
 Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him till I
 come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying.
 Eugene was startled at the change in Goriot's face, so livid, distorted,
 and feeble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you, papa?" he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot turned
 his dull eyes upon Eugene, looked at him attentively, and did not
 recognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the tears came
 into his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be a
 good thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in any
 case to make tisanes and heat the other things. I will send round a few
 sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. I burned all the
 bark fuel you had left, as well as his, poor man, yesterday and during the
 night. The place is so damp that the water stood in drops on the walls; I
 could hardly get the room dry. Christophe came in and swept the floor, but
 the place is like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something
 horrible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" said Rastignac. "To think of those daughters of his."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this," said the
 house student, pointing to a large white jar. "If he begins to groan, and
 the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to do; get
 Christophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much excited, and
 begin to talk a good deal and even to ramble in his talk, do not be
 alarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe to the Hospice
 Cochin. Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply moxas. We had a
 great consultation this morning while you were asleep. A surgeon, a pupil
 of Gall's came, and our house surgeon, and the head physician from the
 Hotel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were very unusual
 and interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for it throws a light
 on several obscure and rather important scientific problems. One of the
 authorities says that if there is more pressure of serum on one or other
 portion of the brain, it should affect his mental capacities in such and
 such directions. So if he should talk, notice very carefully what kind of
 ideas his mind seems to run on; whether memory, or penetration, or the
 reasoning faculties are exercised; whether sentiments or practical
 questions fill his thoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the
 past; in fact; you must be prepared to give an accurate report of him. It
 is quite likely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which
 case he will die in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. You
 cannot tell anything about these mysterious nervous diseases. Suppose the
 crash came here," said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, "very
 strange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes partially
 recovers, and death is delayed. Or the congested matter may pass out of
 the brain altogether through channels which can only be determined by a
 post-mortem examination. There is an old man at the Hospital for
 Incurables, an imbecile patient, in his case the effusion has followed the
 direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but he lives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did they enjoy themselves?" It was Father Goriot who spoke. He had
 recognized Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters," said Bianchon. "Scores of
 times last night he said to me, 'They are dancing now! She has her dress.'
 He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil take it, calling
 with that tone in his voice, for 'Delphine! my little Delphine! and
 Nasie!' Upon my word," said the medical student, "it was enough to make
 any one burst out crying."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Delphine," said the old man, "she is there, isn't she? I knew she was
 there," and his eyes sought the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready," said
 Bianchon. "They ought to go on at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the bed,
 and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was shocking
 to see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Noble natures cannot dwell in this world," he said; "Mme de Beauseant has
 fled from it, and there he lies dying. What place indeed is there in the
 shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts and
 feelings?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pictures of yesterday's ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast to
 the deathbed before him. Bianchon suddenly appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I
 ran all the way back here. If the old man shows any signs of reason, if he
 begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck to the
 base of the spine, and send round for us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear Bianchon," exclaimed Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view," said the
 medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So!" said Eugene. "Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old
 man for his own sake?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning," returned
 Bianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. "Doctors who have seen
 a good deal of practice never see anything but the disease, but, my dear
 fellow, I can see the patient still."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went. Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an apprehension
 of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! dear boy, is that you?" said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you feel better?" asked the law student, taking his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now it is
 set free again. Did you see my girls? They will be here directly; as soon
 as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once; they used to take
 such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! Great Heavens! if only my room
 was fit for them to come into! There has been a young man here, who has
 burned up all my bark fuel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can hear Christophe coming upstairs," Eugene answered. "He is bringing
 up some firewood that that young man has sent you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. I have not a penny left, dear
 boy. I have given everything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at
 least the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Ah! what pain this is!)
 Thanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man's ear, "I will pay
 you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My daughters told you that they were coming, didn't they, Christophe? Go
 again to them, and I will give you five francs. Tell them that I am not
 feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them once again
 before I die. Tell them that, but don't alarm them more than you can
 help."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They will come before long," the old man went on. "I know them so well.
 My tender-hearted Delphine! If I am going to die, she will feel it so
 much! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will cry if I die; and
 if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. It will be very
 dreary there where I am going. For a father it is hell to be without your
 children; I have served my apprenticeship already since they married. My
 heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugene, do you think that if I go
 to heaven I can come back to earth, and be near them in spirit? I have
 heard some such things said. It is true? It is as if I could see them at
 this moment as they used to be when we all lived in the Rue de la
 Jussienne. They used to come downstairs of a morning. 'Good-morning,
 papa!' they used to say, and I would take them on my knees; we had all
 sorts of little games of play together, and they had such pretty coaxing
 ways. We always had breakfast together, too, every morning, and they had
 dinner with me?in fact, I was a father then. I enjoyed my children.
 They did not think for themselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la
 Jussienne; they knew nothing of the world; they loved me with all their
 hearts. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> why could they not always be little girls? (Oh!
 my head! this racking pain in my head!) Ah! ah! forgive me, children, this
 pain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure
 pain. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> if only I held their hands in mine, I should not
 feel it at all.?Do you think that they are on the way? Christophe is
 so stupid; I ought to have gone myself. <i>He</i> will see them. But you
 went to the ball yesterday; just tell me how they looked. They did not
 know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor
 little things? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They stand too much in
 need of me; their fortunes are in danger. And such husbands as they are
 bound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this is! what pain this is! ...
 ah! ah!)?I must get well, you see; for they <i>must</i> have money,
 and I know how to set about making some. I will go to Odessa and
 manufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make millions. (Oh!
 this is agony!)"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Goriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength to
 endure the pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If they were here, I should not complain," he said. "So why should I
 complain now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long time.
 Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was asleep,
 allowed the man to give his story aloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse," he said; "but she and
 her husband were so busy that I couldn't get to speak to her. When I
 insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself, and
 went on like this: 'M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is the best
 thing he can do. I want Mme. de Restaud to transact some important
 business, when it is all finished she can go.' The gentleman looked angry,
 I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud came out into an
 ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice, and said, 'Christophe,
 tell my father that my husband wants me to discuss some matters with him,
 and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my children is at
 stake; but as soon as it is over, I will come.' As for Madame la Baronne,
 that is another story! I could not speak to her either, and I did not even
 see her. Her waiting-woman said, 'Ah yes, but madame only came back from a
 ball at a quarter to five this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake
 her before mid-day she will be cross. As soon as she rings, I will go and
 tell her that her father is worse. It will be time enough then to tell her
 bad news!' I begged and I prayed, but, there! it was no good. Then I asked
 for M. le Baron, but he was out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To think that neither of his daughters should come!" exclaimed Rastignac.
 "I will write to them both."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Neither of them!" cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. "They are
 busy, they are asleep, they will not come! I knew that they would not. Not
 until you are dying do you know your children.... Oh! my friend, do not
 marry; do not have children! You give them life; they give you your
 deathblow. You bring them into the world, and they send you out of it. No,
 they will not come. I have known that these ten years. Sometimes I have
 told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given all
 to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and cover my
 cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great mansion; I should
 have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and <i>they</i>
 would be about me all in tears, and their husbands and their children. I
 should have had all that; now?I have nothing. Money brings
 everything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh! where is my money?
 If I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and tend
 me; I should hear their voices, I should see their faces. Ah, God! who
 knows? They both of them have hearts of stone. I loved them too much; it
 was not likely that they should love me. A father ought always to be rich;
 he ought to keep his children well in hand, like unruly horses. I have
 gone down on my knees to them. Wretches! this is the crowning act that
 brings the last ten years to a proper close. If you but knew how much they
 made of me just after they were married. (Oh! this is cruel torture!) I
 had just given them each eight hundred thousand francs; they were bound to
 be civil to me after that, and their husbands too were civil. I used to go
 to their houses: it was 'My kind father' here, 'My dear father' there.
 There was always a place for me at their tables. I used to dine with their
 husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. I was still
 worth something, they thought. How should they know? I had not said
 anything about my affairs. It is worth while to be civil to a man who has
 given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece; and they showed
 me every attention then?but it was all for my money. Grand people
 are not great. I found that out by experience! I went to the theatre with
 them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I cared to stay at their
 evening parties. In fact, they acknowledged me their father; publicly they
 owned that they were my daughters. But I was always a shrewd one, you see,
 and nothing was lost upon me. Everything went straight to the mark and
 pierced my heart. I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence, but
 there is no help for such things as these. I felt less at my ease at their
 dinner-table than I did downstairs here. I had nothing to say for myself.
 So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law's ear, 'Who may that
 gentleman be?'?'The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very
 rich.'?'The devil, he is!' they would say, and look again at me with
 the respect due to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid
 dearly for my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is one
 sore!) Dear Monsieur Eugene, I am suffering so now, that a man might die
 of the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured when
 Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something
 stupid. She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all my veins. I
 used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one thing I did learn
 thoroughly?I knew that I was not wanted here on earth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there
 but make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. I was like one
 driven out of his senses. For a week I did not know what to do; I did not
 dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. And that was how
 they both turned me out of the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured; Thou
 hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these years that
 have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained my life; why
 dost Thou make me to suffer so to-day? Have I not more than expiated the
 sin of loving them too much? They themselves have been the instruments of
 vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of affection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them as
 a gambler goes to the gaming table. This love was my vice, you see, my
 mistress?they were everything in the world to me. They were always
 wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their
 maids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the things
 for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me. But, at the same
 time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in society; they
 began about it at once. Then they began to feel ashamed of me. That is
 what comes of having your children well brought up. I could not go to
 school again at my time of life. (This pain is fearful! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>
 These doctors! these doctors! If they would open my head, it would give me
 some relief!) Oh, my daughters, my daughters! Anastasie! Delphine! If I
 could only see them! Send for the police, and make them come to me!
 Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have natural
 rights, and the law with me. I protest! The country will go to ruin if a
 father's rights are trampled under foot. That is easy to see. The whole
 world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation of society;
 it will crumble into ruin when children do not love their fathers. Oh! if
 I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what they said; if I could
 simply hear their voices, it would soothe the pain. Delphine! Delphine
 most of all. But tell them when they come not to look so coldly at me as
 they do. Oh! my friend, my good Monsieur Eugene, you do not know that it
 is when all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray.
 It has been one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone no
 more for me. I have had nothing but disappointments to devour.
 Disappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation and
 insults. I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they sold me my
 poor stealthy little moments of joy; for I love them so! Think of it! a
 father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children! I have given all
 my life to them, and to-day they will not give me one hour! I am hungering
 and thirsting for them, my heart is burning in me, but they will not come
 to bring relief in the agony, for I am dying now, I feel that this is
 death. Do they not know what it means to trample on a father's corpse?
 There is a God in heaven who avenges us fathers whether we will or no.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss; one
 last kiss, the Viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you in
 heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good children to your father,
 and plead your cause with God! After all, it is not their fault. I tell
 you they are innocent, my friend. Tell every one that it is not their
 fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. It is all my own
 fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it so. It is no
 one's affair but mine; man's justice and God's justice have nothing to do
 in it. God would be unjust if He condemned them for anything they may have
 done to me. I did not behave to them properly; I was stupid enough to
 resign my rights. I would have humbled myself in the dust for them. What
 could you expect? The most beautiful nature, the noblest soul, would have
 been spoiled by such indulgence. I am a wretch, I am justly punished. I,
 and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I spoiled them. To-day they
 are as eager for pleasure as they used to be for sugar-plums. When they
 were little girls I indulged them in every whim. They had a carriage of
 their own when they were fifteen. They have never been crossed. I am
 guilty, and not they?but I sinned through love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them; they
 are coming. Yes! yes! they are coming. The law demands that they should be
 present at their father's deathbed; the law is on my side. It would only
 cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to them, tell them
 that I have millions to leave to them! On my word of honor, yes. I am
 going to manufacture Italian paste foods at Odessa. I understand the
 trade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has thought of the
 scheme as yet. You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit, as
 there always is with wheat and flour. Hey! hey! and starch too; there are
 millions to be made in the starch trade! You will not be telling a lie.
 Millions, tell them; and even if they really come because they covet the
 money, I would rather let them deceive me; and I shall see them in any
 case. I want my children! I gave them life; they are mine, mine!" and he
 sat upright. The head thus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to
 Eugene like a threat; every line that could still speak spoke of menace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there, dear father," said Eugene, "lie down again; I will write to
 them at once. As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for them myself, if
 they do not come before."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If they do not come?" repeated the old man, sobbing. "Why, I shall be
 dead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is getting
 the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I have been
 cheated! They do not love me?they have never loved me all their
 lives! It is all clear to me. They have not come, and they will not come.
 The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely to give me
 this joy. I know them. They have never cared to guess my disappointments,
 my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to know my life; they will have no
 presentiment of my death; they do not even know the secret of my
 tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now. I have laid my heart open so
 often, that they take everything I do for them as a matter of course. They
 might have asked me for the very eyes out of my head and I would have
 bidden them to pluck them out. They think that all fathers are like
 theirs. You should always make your value felt. Their own children will
 avenge me. Why, for their own sakes they should come to me! Make them
 understand that they are laying up retribution for their own deathbeds.
 All crimes are summed up in this one.... Go to them; just tell them that
 if they stay away it will be parricide! There is enough laid to their
 charge already without adding that to the list. Cry aloud as I do now,
 'Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who has been so
 kind to you is lying ill!'?Not a sound; no one comes! Then am I to
 die like a dog? This is to be my reward?I am forsaken at the last.
 They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. I shall
 rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all, my
 friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to me, eh? ...
 What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in the
 room? She is more tender-hearted than her sister.... Eugene, you are my
 son, you know. You will love her; be a father to her! Her sister is very
 unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am dying, this anguish
 is almost more than I can bear! Cut off my head; leave me nothing but my
 heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Christophe!" shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man
 moaned, and by his cries, "go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for me.?I
 am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring them back to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the military,
 anything and everything, but make them come!" He looked at Eugene, and a
 last gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. "Go to the authorities, to
 the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you have cursed them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who said that!" said the old man in dull amazement. "You know quite well
 that I love them, I adore them! I shall be quite well again if I can see
 them.... Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you are kind-hearted;
 I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have nothing to give you
 now, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if I could only see Delphine,
 to tell her to pay my debt to you. If the other cannot come, bring
 Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that unless she comes, you will not
 love her any more. She is so fond of you that she will come to me then.
 Give me something to drink! There is a fire in my bowels. Press something
 against my forehead! If my daughters would lay their hands there, I think
 I should get better. ... <i>Mon Dieu!</i> who will recover their money for
 them when I am gone?... I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I
 will go to Odessa for their sakes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is something to drink," said Eugene, supporting the dying man on his
 left arm, while he held a cup of tisane to Goriot's lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you must love your own father and mother!" said the old man, and
 grasped the student's hand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling
 grasp. "I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do you
 understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has been my
 life for the last ten years.... I have no daughters, my sons-in-law killed
 them. No, since their marriages they have been dead to me. Fathers should
 petition the Chambers to pass a law against marriage. If you love your
 daughters, do not let them marry. A son-in-law is a rascal who poisons a
 girl's mind and contaminates her whole nature. Let us have no more
 marriages! It robs us of our daughters; we are left alone upon our
 deathbeds, and they are not with us then. They ought to pass a law for
 dying fathers. This is awful! It cries for vengeance! They cannot come,
 because my sons-in-law forbid them!... Kill them!... Restaud and the
 Alsatian, kill them both! They have murdered me between them!... Death or
 my daughters!... Ah! it is too late, I am dying, and they are not here!...
 Dying without them!... Nasie! Fifine! Why do you not come to me? Your papa
 is going??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and rest;
 don't worry yourself, don't think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You <i>shall</i> see them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really?" cried the old man, still wandering. "Oh! shall I see them; I
 shall see them and hear their voices. I shall die happy. Ah! well, after
 all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this pain
 that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch their dresses?ah!
 nothing but their dresses, that is very little; still, to feel something
 that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair with my fingers... their
 hair..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck him
 down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his
 daughters' hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My blessing on them..." he said, making an effort, "my blessing..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I met Christophe," he said; "he is gone for your cab."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his
 fingers. The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath had
 grown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He will not get over this, I am sure," said Bianchon. He felt the old
 man's pulse, and laid a hand over his heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be
 better for him to die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my word, it would!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard.... There is a
 God! Ah! yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world for us,
 or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have cried like a
 child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac took out his watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the Rue
 du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must wait
 here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall have to
 pay the cabman when I get home again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder. The
 awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his imagination,
 and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de Restaud's house only to
 be told by the servant that his mistress could see no one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying," Rastignac
 told the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his
 father-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at
 once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene waited for a long while. "Perhaps her father is dying at this
 moment," he thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little
 drawing-room. M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate, and
 did not ask his visitor to seat himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur le Comte," said Rastignac, "M. Goriot, your father-in-law, is
 lying at the point of death in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter. He has
 not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any moment, and
 keeps calling for his daughter??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are
 aware," the Count answered coolly. "His character has been compromised in
 connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the misfortunes that
 have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. It is a matter of
 perfect indifference to me if he lives or dies. Now you know my feelings
 with regard to him. Public opinion may blame me, but I care nothing for
 public opinion. Just now I have other and much more important matters to
 think about than the things that fools and chatterers may say about me. As
 for Mme. de Restaud, she cannot leave the house; she is in no condition to
 do so. And, besides, I shall not allow her to leave it. Tell her father
 that as soon as she has done her duty by her husband and child she shall
 go to see him. If she has any love for her father, she can be free to go
 to him, if she chooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely with her??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct;
 you can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon your keeping
 your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her that her father has
 not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her, and has
 cursed her already as he lies on his deathbed,?that is all I ask."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can tell her yourself," the Count answered, impressed by the thrill
 of indignation in Eugene's voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was
 drowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as if
 she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see her.
 Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in
 evident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of body and
 mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and physical. The Count
 jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew all
 he would forgive me.... I did not think there was such torture in the
 world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!?But I will
 not give way as long as I live," she said, turning to her husband. "I am a
 mother.?Tell my father that I have never sinned against him in spite
 of appearances!" she cried aloud in her despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the scene,
 and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess' life. M. de Restaud's
 manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one; he saw that
 Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came away mazed and
 bewildered, and hurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine was in bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor dear Eugene, I am ill," she said. "I caught cold after the ball, and
 I am afraid of pneumonia. I am waiting for the doctor to come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you were at death's door," Eugene broke in, "you must be carried
 somehow to your father. He is calling for you. If you could hear the
 faintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I cannot
 bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just as you
 wish. As for <i>him</i>, he would die of grief I know if I went out to see
 him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as I have
 seen the doctor.?Ah!" she cried out, "you are not wearing your
 watch, how is that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene reddened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eugene, Eugene! if you have sold it already or lost it.... Oh! it would
 be very wrong of you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, "Do you want to know?
 Very well, then, you shall know. Your father has nothing left to pay for
 the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your watch has been
 pawned, for I had nothing either."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Delphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. She
 gave it to Eugene, and rang the bell, crying:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. Leave me, I will dress. Why, I
 should be an unnatural daughter! Go back; I will be there before you.?Therese,"
 she called to the waiting-woman, "ask M. de Nucingen to come upstairs at
 once and speak to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve; he
 was so glad to bring the news to the dying man that one of his daughters
 was coming. He fumbled in Delphine's purse for money, so as to dismiss the
 cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and wealthy woman
 of fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse. He climbed the
 stairs and found Bianchon supporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from
 the hospital was applying moxas to the patient's back?under the
 direction of the physician, it was the last expedient of science, and it
 was tried in vain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you feel them?" asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight of
 Rastignac, and answered, "They are coming, are they not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is hope yet," said the surgeon; "he can speak."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Eugene, "Delphine is coming."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! that is nothing!" said Bianchon; "he has been talking about his
 daughters all the time. He calls for them as a man impaled calls for
 water, they say??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We may as well give up," said the physician, addressing the surgeon.
 "Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his
 loathsome bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the sheets ought to be changed," added the physician. "Even if there
 is no hope left, something is due to human nature. I shall come back
 again, Bianchon," he said, turning to the medical student. "If he
 complains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went, and the house surgeon went with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy," said Bianchon, as soon as they
 were alone; "we must set about changing his sheets, and put him into a
 clean shirt. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help us
 to make the bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the
 table; Sylvie was helping her. Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth before
 the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a cautious
 shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a customer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear Monsieur Eugene," she said, when he had spoken, "you know quite
 as well as I do that Father Goriot has not a brass farthing left. If you
 give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn up his eyes, you
 are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be wanted to
 wrap him in. Now, you owe me a hundred and forty-four francs as it is, add
 forty francs for the pair of sheets, and then there are several little
 things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you; altogether it will
 all mount up to at least two hundred francs, which is more than a poor
 widow like me can afford to lose. Lord! now, Monsieur Eugene, look at it
 fairly. I have lost quite enough in these five days since this run of
 ill-luck set in for me. I would rather than ten crowns that the old
 gentlemen had moved out as you said. It sets the other lodgers against the
 house. It would not take much to make me send him to the workhouse. In
 short, just put yourself in my place. I have to think of my establishment
 first, for I have my own living to make."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene hurried up to Goriot's room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bianchon," he cried, "the money for the watch?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs that
 are left of it. I paid up all the old scores out of it before they let me
 have the things. The pawn ticket lies there under the money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac hurried downstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, madame" he said in disgust, "let us square accounts. M. Goriot will
 not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman," she said,
 counting the francs with a half-facetious, half-lugubrious expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us get this over," said Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You won't forget Sylvie," said Mme. Vauquer in Eugene's ear; "she has
 been sitting up these two nights."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as Eugene's back was turned, the old woman hurried after her
 handmaid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle, number 7.
 Lord! they are plenty good enough for a corpse," she said in Sylvie's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear
 the elderly economist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quick," said Bianchon, "let us change his shirt. Hold him upright."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while
 Bianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he
 tried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate
 moaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! yes!" cried Bianchon. "It is the little locket and the chain made of
 hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the blisters on
 him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies on the
 chimney-piece."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded
 golden hair?Mme. Goriot's hair, no doubt. He read the name on the
 little round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other. It
 was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his breast.
 The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that is was
 plain they had been taken from two childish heads. When the old man felt
 the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh of
 satisfaction, like a groan. It was something terrible to see, for it
 seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their eyes,
 the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence our
 sympathies come and whither they go. A delirious joy lighted up the
 distorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the feeling that had
 survived the power of thought made such an impression on the students,
 that the dying man felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a shrill
 cry of delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nasie! Fifine!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is life in him yet," said Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does he go on living for?" said Sylvie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To suffer," answered Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and
 pressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did
 the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw the sheet from
 beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. Those tears, no
 doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining strength in
 a last effort, stretched out his hands, groped for the students' heads,
 and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair, they heard a faint
 whisper:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my angels!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which
 fled forth with them as they left his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor dear!" cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of
 the great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that most
 ghastly and involuntary of lies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The father's last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh
 his whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last. They laid
 Father Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands. Thenceforward
 there was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the
 struggle between life and death that was going on in the machine; for that
 kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes between pleasure and
 pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of time?and
 the mechanism itself would be destroyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last, that
 we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the throat. The
 brain must be completely suffused."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman
 hastened up, panting for breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She has come too late," said Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood in
 the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Eugene," she said, "monsieur and madame have had a terrible
 scene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her father.
 She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled, calling out all
 the while, 'My father is dying; I want to see papa!' It was heartbreaking
 to hear her??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown away.
 M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?" said Therese.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is
 half-past four," remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but collided
 with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of the
 Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single candle,
 and her tears flowed at the sight of her father's passive features, from
 which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful tact left the
 room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I could not escape soon enough," she said to Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father's hand
 and kissed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back
 from the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent
 daughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will ever
 bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all
 the world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you, father; I will
 love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me ... I am mad..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My cup of misery is full," she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene. "M. de
 Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have found out
 that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive me, and I have
 left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illusions. Alas! I have
 forsaken the one heart that loved me (she pointed to her father as she
 spoke), and for whom? I have held his kindness cheap, and slighted his
 affection; many and many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful wretch
 that I am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He knew it," said Rastignac.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then Goriot's eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction,
 but the Countess' sudden start of reviving hope was no less dreadful than
 the dying eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it possible that he can hear me?" cried the Countess. "No," she
 answered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud seemed
 to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little food. The
 boarders were already assembled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," remarked the painter, as he joined them, "it seems that there is
 to be a death-orama upstairs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about,"
 said Eugene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So we may not laugh here?" returned the painter. "What harm does it do?
 Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," said the <i>employe</i> from the Museum, "he will die as he
 has lived."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My father is dead!" shrieked the Countess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de Restaud
 had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her downstairs, and put
 her into the cab that stood waiting at the door. Eugene sent Therese with
 her, and bade the maid take the Countess to Mme. de Nucingen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon came down to them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he is dead," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen," said Mme. Vauquer, "or the soup
 will be cold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two students sat down together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the next thing to be done?" Eugene asked of Bianchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs," said Bianchon. "When the
 certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor's office, we will
 sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. What do you think we
 ought to do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He will not smell at his bread like this any more," said the painter,
 mimicking the old man's little trick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, hang it all!" cried the tutor, "let Father Goriot drop, and let us
 have something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we have had
 him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the privileges of the
 good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there without
 attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us profit by the advantages of
 civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every day; if you have a
 mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs
 of dead in Paris. Father Goriot has gone off the hooks, has he? So much
 the better for him. If you venerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and
 let the rest of us feed in peace."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, to be sure," said the widow, "it is all the better for him that he is
 dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while he
 was alive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for
 Eugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene had
 satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous
 conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke various degrees of
 want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them made
 them shiver with loathing. They went out to find a priest to watch that
 night with the dead. It was necessary to measure their last pious cares by
 the scanty sum of money that remained. Before nine o'clock that evening
 the body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate
 room; a lighted candle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the
 foot. Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the
 funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud,
 entreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray the
 charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent Christophe
 with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and slept.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate to
 the registrar themselves, and by twelve o'clock the formalities were
 completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor from the
 Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been
 obliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old man
 in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the grave, and Eugene and
 Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the
 funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the dead man's family. So it was
 the medical student who laid him in a pauper's coffin, despatched from
 Bianchon's hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us play those wretches a trick," said he. "Go to the cemetery, buy a
 grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and the
 undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the daughters and their
 husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the headstone?'<i>Here
 lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de Restaud and the Baronne de
 Nucingen, interred at the expense of two students</i>.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene took part of his friend's advice, but only after he had gone in
 person first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de
 Restaud?a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in
 either house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their
 father, and are in deep grief over their loss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Eugene's Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the point.
 Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it was
 impossible to reach Delphine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sell some of your ornaments," he wrote hastily in the porter's room, "so
 that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for her
 mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the note
 into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands, returned to the
 lodging-house about three o'clock. In spite of himself, the tears came
 into his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth, was
 standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two chairs. A withered
 sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of silver-plated
 copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a passer-by had stopped to
 sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over
 the wicket. It was a pauper who lay there; no one made a pretence of
 mourning for him; he had neither friends nor kindred?there was no
 one to follow him to the grave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bianchon's duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left a
 few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he had
 made for the burial service. The house student's note told Rastignac that
 a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the dead was
 cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word to the undertaker by
 Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading Bianchon's scrawl, when
 he looked up and saw the little circular gold locket that contained the
 hair of Goriot's two daughters in Mme. Vauquer's hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How dared you take it?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?" retorted Sylvie. "It is
 gold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course it shall!" Eugene answered indignantly; "he shall at any rate
 take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house again,
 unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man's breast the token
 that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were innocent little
 maidens, before they began "to think for themselves," as he had moaned out
 in his agony.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker's men were the only
 followers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only a
 little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. When the coffin had
 been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked round
 in vain for Goriot's two daughters or their husbands. Christophe was his
 only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to think it was his duty to
 attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way of such handsome
 tips. As they waited there in the chapel for the two priests, the
 chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped Christophe's hand. He could
 not utter a word just then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Monsieur Eugene," said Christophe, "he was a good and worthy man,
 who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one any
 harm, and gave nobody any trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did as
 much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when religion
 cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the <i>Libera nos</i> and the <i>De
 profundis</i>. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was
 but one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share
 with Eugene and Christophe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is no one else to follow us," remarked the priest, "so we may as
 well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with
 the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen,
 arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. At six o'clock
 Goriot's coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters' servants
 standing round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that
 the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and lackeys
 disappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in several spadefuls of
 earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for their fee. Eugene felt in
 vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs of Christophe.
 This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible pang of
 distress. It was growing dusk, the damp twilight fretted his nerves; he
 gazed down into the grave and the tears he shed were drawn from him by the
 sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth,
 their radiance reaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Father
 Goriot's grave, Eugene Rastignac's youth ended. He folded his arms and
 gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned
 and went?Rastignac was left alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and
 looked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were
 beginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost
 eagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the
 cupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had wished to
 reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a foretaste of
 its honey, and said magniloquently:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Henceforth there is war between us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to dine
 with Mme. de Nucingen.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
