 <h2>
 Chapter I.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I am a native of _____, in the United States of America. My ancestors
 migrated from England in the reign of Charles II.; and my grandfather was
 not undistinguished in the War of Independence. My family, therefore,
 enjoyed a somewhat high social position in right of birth; and being also
 opulent, they were considered disqualified for the public service. My
 father once ran for Congress, but was signally defeated by his tailor.
 After that event he interfered little in politics, and lived much in his
 library. I was the eldest of three sons, and sent at the age of sixteen to
 the old country, partly to complete my literary education, partly to
 commence my commercial training in a mercantile firm at Liverpool. My
 father died shortly after I was twenty-one; and being left well off, and
 having a taste for travel and adventure, I resigned, for a time, all
 pursuit of the almighty dollar, and became a desultory wanderer over the
 face of the earth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the year 18__, happening to be in _____, I was invited by a
 professional engineer, with whom I had made acquaintance, to visit the
 recesses of the ________ mine, upon which he was employed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The reader will understand, ere he close this narrative, my reason for
 concealing all clue to the district of which I write, and will perhaps
 thank me for refraining from any description that may tend to its
 discovery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let me say, then, as briefly as possible, that I accompanied the engineer
 into the interior of the mine, and became so strangely fascinated by its
 gloomy wonders, and so interested in my friend's explorations, that I
 prolonged my stay in the neighbourhood, and descended daily, for some
 weeks, into the vaults and galleries hollowed by nature and art beneath
 the surface of the earth. The engineer was persuaded that far richer
 deposits of mineral wealth than had yet been detected, would be found in a
 new shaft that had been commenced under his operations. In piercing this
 shaft we came one day upon a chasm jagged and seemingly charred at the
 sides, as if burst asunder at some distant period by volcanic fires. Down
 this chasm my friend caused himself to be lowered in a 'cage,' having
 first tested the atmosphere by the safety-lamp. He remained nearly an hour
 in the abyss. When he returned he was very pale, and with an anxious,
 thoughtful expression of face, very different from its ordinary character,
 which was open, cheerful, and fearless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He said briefly that the descent appeared to him unsafe, and leading to no
 result; and, suspending further operations in the shaft, we returned to
 the more familiar parts of the mine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the rest of that day the engineer seemed preoccupied by some absorbing
 thought. He was unusually taciturn, and there was a scared, bewildered
 look in his eyes, as that of a man who has seen a ghost. At night, as we
 two were sitting alone in the lodging we shared together near the mouth of
 the mine, I said to my friend,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me frankly what you saw in that chasm: I am sure it was something
 strange and terrible. Whatever it be, it has left your mind in a state of
 doubt. In such a case two heads are better than one. Confide in me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The engineer long endeavoured to evade my inquiries; but as, while he
 spoke, he helped himself unconsciously out of the brandy-flask to a degree
 to which he was wholly unaccustomed, for he was a very temperate man, his
 reserve gradually melted away. He who would keep himself to himself should
 imitate the dumb animals, and drink water. At last he said, "I will tell
 you all. When the cage stopped, I found myself on a ridge of rock; and
 below me, the chasm, taking a slanting direction, shot down to a
 considerable depth, the darkness of which my lamp could not have
 penetrated. But through it, to my infinite surprise, streamed upward a
 steady brilliant light. Could it be any volcanic fire? In that case,
 surely I should have felt the heat. Still, if on this there was doubt, it
 was of the utmost importance to our common safety to clear it up. I
 examined the sides of the descent, and found that I could venture to trust
 myself to the irregular projection of ledges, at least for some way. I
 left the cage and clambered down. As I drew nearer and nearer to the
 light, the chasm became wider, and at last I saw, to my unspeakable amaze,
 a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss, illumined as far as the eye
 could reach by what seemed artificial gas-lamps placed at regular
 intervals, as in the thoroughfare of a great city; and I heard confusedly
 at a distance a hum as of human voices. I know, of course, that no rival
 miners are at work in this district. Whose could be those voices? What
 human hands could have levelled that road and marshalled those lamps?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The superstitious belief, common to miners, that gnomes or fiends dwell
 within the bowels of the earth, began to seize me. I shuddered at the
 thought of descending further and braving the inhabitants of this nether
 valley. Nor indeed could I have done so without ropes, as from the spot I
 had reached to the bottom of the chasm the sides of the rock sank down
 abrupt, smooth, and sheer. I retraced my steps with some difficulty. Now I
 have told you all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will descend again?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ought, yet I feel as if I durst not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A trusty companion halves the journey and doubles the courage. I will go
 with you. We will provide ourselves with ropes of suitable length and
 strength?and?pardon me?you must not drink more to-night,
 our hands and feet must be steady and firm tomorrow."

 <h2>
 Chapter II.
 </h2>
 <p>
 With the morning my friend's nerves were rebraced, and he was not less
 excited by curiosity than myself. Perhaps more; for he evidently believed
 in his own story, and I felt considerable doubt of it; not that he would
 have wilfully told an untruth, but that I thought he must have been under
 one of those hallucinations which seize on our fancy or our nerves in
 solitary, unaccustomed places, and in which we give shape to the formless
 and sound to the dumb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We selected six veteran miners to watch our descent; and as the cage held
 only one at a time, the engineer descended first; and when he had gained
 the ledge at which he had before halted, the cage rearose for me. I soon
 gained his side. We had provided ourselves with a strong coil of rope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The light struck on my sight as it had done the day before on my friend's.
 The hollow through which it came sloped diagonally: it seemed to me a
 diffused atmospheric light, not like that from fire, but soft and silvery,
 as from a northern star. Quitting the cage, we descended, one after the
 other, easily enough, owing to the juts in the side, till we reached the
 place at which my friend had previously halted, and which was a projection
 just spacious enough to allow us to stand abreast. From this spot the
 chasm widened rapidly like the lower end of a vast funnel, and I saw
 distinctly the valley, the road, the lamps which my companion had
 described. He had exaggerated nothing. I heard the sounds he had heard?a
 mingled indescribable hum as of voices and a dull tramp as of feet.
 Straining my eye farther down, I clearly beheld at a distance the outline
 of some large building. It could not be mere natural rock, it was too
 symmetrical, with huge heavy Egyptian-like columns, and the whole lighted
 as from within. I had about me a small pocket-telescope, and by the aid of
 this, I could distinguish, near the building I mention, two forms which
 seemed human, though I could not be sure. At least they were living, for
 they moved, and both vanished within the building. We now proceeded to
 attach the end of the rope we had brought with us to the ledge on which we
 stood, by the aid of clamps and grappling hooks, with which, as well as
 with necessary tools, we were provided.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were almost silent in our work. We toiled like men afraid to speak to
 each other. One end of the rope being thus apparently made firm to the
 ledge, the other, to which we fastened a fragment of the rock, rested on
 the ground below, a distance of some fifty feet. I was a younger man and a
 more active man than my companion, and having served on board ship in my
 boyhood, this mode of transit was more familiar to me than to him. In a
 whisper I claimed the precedence, so that when I gained the ground I might
 serve to hold the rope more steady for his descent. I got safely to the
 ground beneath, and the engineer now began to lower himself. But he had
 scarcely accomplished ten feet of the descent, when the fastenings, which
 we had fancied so secure, gave way, or rather the rock itself proved
 treacherous and crumbled beneath the strain; and the unhappy man was
 precipitated to the bottom, falling just at my feet, and bringing down
 with his fall splinters of the rock, one of which, fortunately but a small
 one, struck and for the time stunned me. When I recovered my senses I saw
 my companion an inanimate mass beside me, life utterly extinct. While I
 was bending over his corpse in grief and horror, I heard close at hand a
 strange sound between a snort and a hiss; and turning instinctively to the
 quarter from which it came, I saw emerging from a dark fissure in the rock
 a vast and terrible head, with open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes?the
 head of a monstrous reptile resembling that of the crocodile or alligator,
 but infinitely larger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever
 beheld in my travels. I started to my feet and fled down the valley at my
 utmost speed. I stopped at last, ashamed of my panic and my flight, and
 returned to the spot on which I had left the body of my friend. It was
 gone; doubtless the monster had already drawn it into its den and devoured
 it. The rope and the grappling-hooks still lay where they had fallen, but
 they afforded me no chance of return; it was impossible to re-attach them
 to the rock above, and the sides of the rock were too sheer and smooth for
 human steps to clamber. I was alone in this strange world, amidst the
 bowels of the earth.

 <h2>
 Chapter III.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Slowly and cautiously I went my solitary way down the lamplit road and
 towards the large building I have described. The road itself seemed like a
 great Alpine pass, skirting rocky mountains of which the one through whose
 chasm I had descended formed a link. Deep below to the left lay a vast
 valley, which presented to my astonished eye the unmistakeable evidences
 of art and culture. There were fields covered with a strange vegetation,
 similar to none I have seen above the earth; the colour of it not green,
 but rather of a dull and leaden hue or of a golden red.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were lakes and rivulets which seemed to have been curved into
 artificial banks; some of pure water, others that shone like pools of
 naphtha. At my right hand, ravines and defiles opened amidst the rocks,
 with passes between, evidently constructed by art, and bordered by trees
 resembling, for the most part, gigantic ferns, with exquisite varieties of
 feathery foliage, and stems like those of the palm-tree. Others were more
 like the cane-plant, but taller, bearing large clusters of flowers.
 Others, again, had the form of enormous fungi, with short thick stems
 supporting a wide dome-like roof, from which either rose or drooped long
 slender branches. The whole scene behind, before, and beside me far as the
 eye could reach, was brilliant with innumerable lamps. The world without a
 sun was bright and warm as an Italian landscape at noon, but the air less
 oppressive, the heat softer. Nor was the scene before me void of signs of
 habitation. I could distinguish at a distance, whether on the banks of the
 lake or rivulet, or half-way upon eminences, embedded amidst the
 vegetation, buildings that must surely be the homes of men. I could even
 discover, though far off, forms that appeared to me human moving amidst
 the landscape. As I paused to gaze, I saw to the right, gliding quickly
 through the air, what appeared a small boat, impelled by sails shaped like
 wings. It soon passed out of sight, descending amidst the shades of a
 forest. Right above me there was no sky, but only a cavernous roof. This
 roof grew higher and higher at the distance of the landscapes beyond, till
 it became imperceptible, as an atmosphere of haze formed itself beneath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Continuing my walk, I started,?from a bush that resembled a great
 tangle of sea-weeds, interspersed with fern-like shrubs and plants of
 large leafage shaped like that of the aloe or prickly-pear,?a
 curious animal about the size and shape of a deer. But as, after bounding
 away a few paces, it turned round and gazed at me inquisitively, I
 perceived that it was not like any species of deer now extant above the
 earth, but it brought instantly to my recollection a plaster cast I had
 seen in some museum of a variety of the elk stag, said to have existed
 before the Deluge. The creature seemed tame enough, and, after inspecting
 me a moment or two, began to graze on the singular herbiage around
 undismayed and careless.

 <h2>
 Chapter IV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I now came in full sight of the building. Yes, it had been made by hands,
 and hollowed partly out of a great rock. I should have supposed it at the
 first glance to have been of the earliest form of Egyptian architecture.
 It was fronted by huge columns, tapering upward from massive plinths, and
 with capitals that, as I came nearer, I perceived to be more ornamental
 and more fantastically graceful that Egyptian architecture allows. As the
 Corinthian capital mimics the leaf of the acanthus, so the capitals of
 these columns imitated the foliage of the vegetation neighbouring them,
 some aloe-like, some fern-like. And now there came out of this building a
 form?human;?was it human? It stood on the broad way and looked
 around, beheld me and approached. It came within a few yards of me, and at
 the sight and presence of it an indescribable awe and tremor seized me,
 rooting my feet to the ground. It reminded me of symbolical images of
 Genius or Demon that are seen on Etruscan vases or limned on the walls of
 Eastern sepulchres?images that borrow the outlines of man, and are
 yet of another race. It was tall, not gigantic, but tall as the tallest
 man below the height of giants.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Its chief covering seemed to me to be composed of large wings folded over
 its breast and reaching to its knees; the rest of its attire was composed
 of an under tunic and leggings of some thin fibrous material. It wore on
 its head a kind of tiara that shone with jewels, and carried in its right
 hand a slender staff of bright metal like polished steel. But the face! it
 was that which inspired my awe and my terror. It was the face of man, but
 yet of a type of man distinct from our known extant races. The nearest
 approach to it in outline and expression is the face of the sculptured
 sphinx?so regular in its calm, intellectual, mysterious beauty. Its
 colour was peculiar, more like that of the red man than any other variety
 of our species, and yet different from it?a richer and a softer hue,
 with large black eyes, deep and brilliant, and brows arched as a
 semicircle. The face was beardless; but a nameless something in the
 aspect, tranquil though the expression, and beauteous though the features,
 roused that instinct of danger which the sight of a tiger or serpent
 arouses. I felt that this manlike image was endowed with forces inimical
 to man. As it drew near, a cold shudder came over me. I fell on my knees
 and covered my face with my hands.

 <h2>
 Chapter V.
 </h2>
 <p>
 A voice accosted me?a very quiet and very musical key of voice?in
 a language of which I could not understand a word, but it served to dispel
 my fear. I uncovered my face and looked up. The stranger (I could scarcely
 bring myself to call him man) surveyed me with an eye that seemed to read
 to the very depths of my heart. He then placed his left hand on my
 forehead, and with the staff in his right, gently touched my shoulder. The
 effect of this double contact was magical. In place of my former terror
 there passed into me a sense of contentment, of joy, of confidence in
 myself and in the being before me. I rose and spoke in my own language. He
 listened to me with apparent attention, but with a slight surprise in his
 looks; and shook his head, as if to signify that I was not understood. He
 then took me by the hand and led me in silence to the building. The
 entrance was open?indeed there was no door to it. We entered an
 immense hall, lighted by the same kind of lustre as in the scene without,
 but diffusing a fragrant odour. The floor was in large tesselated blocks
 of precious metals, and partly covered with a sort of matlike carpeting. A
 strain of low music, above and around, undulated as if from invisible
 instruments, seeming to belong naturally to the place, just as the sound
 of murmuring waters belongs to a rocky landscape, or the warble of birds
 to vernal groves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A figure in a simpler garb than that of my guide, but of similar fashion,
 was standing motionless near the threshold. My guide touched it twice with
 his staff, and it put itself into a rapid and gliding movement, skimming
 noiselessly over the floor. Gazing on it, I then saw that it was no living
 form, but a mechanical automaton. It might be two minutes after it
 vanished through a doorless opening, half screened by curtains at the
 other end of the hall, when through the same opening advanced a boy of
 about twelve years old, with features closely resembling those of my
 guide, so that they seemed to me evidently son and father. On seeing me
 the child uttered a cry, and lifted a staff like that borne by my guide,
 as if in menace. At a word from the elder he dropped it. The two then
 conversed for some moments, examining me while they spoke. The child
 touched my garments, and stroked my face with evident curiosity, uttering
 a sound like a laugh, but with an hilarity more subdued that the mirth of
 our laughter. Presently the roof of the hall opened, and a platform
 descended, seemingly constructed on the same principle as the 'lifts' used
 in hotels and warehouses for mounting from one story to another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger placed himself and the child on the platform, and motioned to
 me to do the same, which I did. We ascended quickly and safely, and
 alighted in the midst of a corridor with doorways on either side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Through one of these doorways I was conducted into a chamber fitted up
 with an oriental splendour; the walls were tesselated with spars, and
 metals, and uncut jewels; cushions and divans abounded; apertures as for
 windows but unglazed, were made in the chamber opening to the floor; and
 as I passed along I observed that these openings led into spacious
 balconies, and commanded views of the illumined landscape without. In
 cages suspended from the ceiling there were birds of strange form and
 bright plumage, which at our entrance set up a chorus of song, modulated
 into tune as is that of our piping bullfinches. A delicious fragrance,
 from censers of gold elaborately sculptured, filled the air. Several
 automata, like the one I had seen, stood dumb and motionless by the walls.
 The stranger placed me beside him on a divan and again spoke to me, and
 again I spoke, but without the least advance towards understanding each
 other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But now I began to feel the effects of the blow I had received from the
 splinters of the falling rock more acutely that I had done at first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There came over me a sense of sickly faintness, accompanied with acute,
 lancinating pains in the head and neck. I sank back on the seat and strove
 in vain to stifle a groan. On this the child, who had hitherto seemed to
 eye me with distrust or dislike, knelt by my side to support me; taking
 one of my hands in both his own, he approached his lips to my forehead,
 breathing on it softly. In a few moments my pain ceased; a drowsy, heavy
 calm crept over me; I fell asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How long I remained in this state I know not, but when I woke I felt
 perfectly restored. My eyes opened upon a group of silent forms, seated
 around me in the gravity and quietude of Orientals?all more or less
 like the first stranger; the same mantling wings, the same fashion of
 garment, the same sphinx-like faces, with the deep dark eyes and red man's
 colour; above all, the same type of race?race akin to man's, but
 infinitely stronger of form and grandeur of aspect?and inspiring the
 same unutterable feeling of dread. Yet each countenance was mild and
 tranquil, and even kindly in expression. And, strangely enough, it seemed
 to me that in this very calm and benignity consisted the secret of the
 dread which the countenances inspired. They seemed as void of the lines
 and shadows which care and sorrow, and passion and sin, leave upon the
 faces of men, as are the faces of sculptured gods, or as, in the eyes of
 Christian mourners, seem the peaceful brows of the dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I felt a warm hand on my shoulder; it was the child's. In his eyes there
 was a sort of lofty pity and tenderness, such as that with which we may
 gaze on some suffering bird or butterfly. I shrank from that touch?I
 shrank from that eye. I was vaguely impressed with a belief that, had he
 so pleased, that child could have killed me as easily as a man can kill a
 bird or a butterfly. The child seemed pained at my repugnance, quitted me,
 and placed himself beside one of the windows. The others continued to
 converse with each other in a low tone, and by their glances towards me I
 could perceive that I was the object of their conversation. One in
 especial seemed to be urging some proposal affecting me on the being whom
 I had first met, and this last by his gesture seemed about to assent to
 it, when the child suddenly quitted his post by the window, placed himself
 between me and the other forms, as if in protection, and spoke quickly and
 eagerly. By some intuition or instinct I felt that the child I had before
 so dreaded was pleading in my behalf. Ere he had ceased another stranger
 entered the room. He appeared older than the rest, though not old; his
 countenance less smoothly serene than theirs, though equally regular in
 its features, seemed to me to have more the touch of a humanity akin to my
 own. He listened quietly to the words addressed to him, first by my guide,
 next by two others of the group, and lastly by the child; then turned
 towards myself, and addressed me, not by words, but by signs and gestures.
 These I fancied that I perfectly understood, and I was not mistaken. I
 comprehended that he inquired whence I came. I extended my arm, and
 pointed towards the road which had led me from the chasm in the rock; then
 an idea seized me. I drew forth my pocket-book, and sketched on one of its
 blank leaves a rough design of the ledge of the rock, the rope, myself
 clinging to it; then of the cavernous rock below, the head of the reptile,
 the lifeless form of my friend. I gave this primitive kind of hieroglyph
 to my interrogator, who, after inspecting it gravely, handed it to his
 next neighbour, and it thus passed round the group. The being I had at
 first encountered then said a few words, and the child, who approached and
 looked at my drawing, nodded as if he comprehended its purport, and,
 returning to the window, expanded the wings attached to his form, shook
 them once or twice, and then launched himself into space without. I
 started up in amaze and hastened to the window. The child was already in
 the air, buoyed on his wings, which he did not flap to and fro as a bird
 does, but which were elevated over his head, and seemed to bear him
 steadily aloft without effort of his own. His flight seemed as swift as an
 eagle's; and I observed that it was towards the rock whence I had
 descended, of which the outline loomed visible in the brilliant
 atmosphere. In a very few minutes he returned, skimming through the
 opening from which he had gone, and dropping on the floor the rope and
 grappling-hooks I had left at the descent from the chasm. Some words in a
 low tone passed between the being present; one of the group touched an
 automaton, which started forward and glided from the room; then the last
 comer, who had addressed me by gestures, rose, took me by the hand, and
 led me into the corridor. There the platform by which I had mounted
 awaited us; we placed ourselves on it and were lowered into the hall
 below. My new companion, still holding me by the hand, conducted me from
 the building into a street (so to speak) that stretched beyond it, with
 buildings on either side, separated from each other by gardens bright with
 rich-coloured vegetation and strange flowers. Interspersed amidst these
 gardens, which were divided from each other by low walls, or walking
 slowly along the road, were many forms similar to those I had already
 seen. Some of the passers-by, on observing me, approached my guide,
 evidently by their tones, looks, and gestures addressing to him inquiries
 about myself. In a few moments a crowd collected around us, examining me
 with great interest, as if I were some rare wild animal. Yet even in
 gratifying their curiosity they preserved a grave and courteous demeanour;
 and after a few words from my guide, who seemed to me to deprecate
 obstruction in our road, they fell back with a stately inclination of
 head, and resumed their own way with tranquil indifference. Midway in this
 thoroughfare we stopped at a building that differed from those we had
 hitherto passed, inasmuch as it formed three sides of a vast court, at the
 angles of which were lofty pyramidal towers; in the open space between the
 sides was a circular fountain of colossal dimensions, and throwing up a
 dazzling spray of what seemed to me fire. We entered the building through
 an open doorway and came into an enormous hall, in which were several
 groups of children, all apparently employed in work as at some great
 factory. There was a huge engine in the wall which was in full play, with
 wheels and cylinders resembling our own steam-engines, except that it was
 richly ornamented with precious stones and metals, and appeared to emanate
 a pale phosphorescent atmosphere of shifting light. Many of the children
 were at some mysterious work on this machinery, others were seated before
 tables. I was not allowed to linger long enough to examine into the nature
 of their employment. Not one young voice was heard?not one young
 face turned to gaze on us. They were all still and indifferent as may be
 ghosts, through the midst of which pass unnoticed the forms of the living.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Quitting this hall, my guide led me through a gallery richly painted in
 compartments, with a barbaric mixture of gold in the colours, like
 pictures by Louis Cranach. The subjects described on these walls appeared
 to my glance as intended to illustrate events in the history of the race
 amidst which I was admitted. In all there were figures, most of them like
 the manlike creatures I had seen, but not all in the same fashion of garb,
 nor all with wings. There were also the effigies of various animals and
 birds, wholly strange to me, with backgrounds depicting landscapes or
 buildings. So far as my imperfect knowledge of the pictorial art would
 allow me to form an opinion, these paintings seemed very accurate in
 design and very rich in colouring, showing a perfect knowledge of
 perspective, but their details not arranged according to the rules of
 composition acknowledged by our artists?wanting, as it were, a
 centre; so that the effect was vague, scattered, confused, bewildering?they
 were like heterogeneous fragments of a dream of art.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We now came into a room of moderate size, in which was assembled what I
 afterwards knew to be the family of my guide, seated at a table spread as
 for repast. The forms thus grouped were those of my guide's wife, his
 daughter, and two sons. I recognised at once the difference between the
 two sexes, though the two females were of taller stature and ampler
 proportions than the males; and their countenances, if still more
 symmetrical in outline and contour, were devoid of the softness and
 timidity of expression which give charm to the face of woman as seen on
 the earth above. The wife wore no wings, the daughter wore wings longer
 than those of the males.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My guide uttered a few words, on which all the persons seated rose, and
 with that peculiar mildness of look and manner which I have before
 noticed, and which is, in truth, the common attribute of this formidable
 race, they saluted me according to their fashion, which consists in laying
 the right hand very gently on the head and uttering a soft sibilant
 monosyllable?S.Si, equivalent to "Welcome."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mistress of the house then seated me beside her, and heaped a golden
 platter before me from one of the dishes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While I ate (and though the viands were new to me, I marvelled more at the
 delicacy than the strangeness of their flavour), my companions conversed
 quietly, and, so far as I could detect, with polite avoidance of any
 direct reference to myself, or any obtrusive scrutiny of my appearance.
 Yet I was the first creature of that variety of the human race to which I
 belong that they had ever beheld, and was consequently regarded by them as
 a most curious and abnormal phenomenon. But all rudeness is unknown to
 this people, and the youngest child is taught to despise any vehement
 emotional demonstration. When the meal was ended, my guide again took me
 by the hand, and, re-entering the gallery, touched a metallic plate
 inscribed with strange figures, and which I rightly conjectured to be of
 the nature of our telegraphs. A platform descended, but this time we
 mounted to a much greater height than in the former building, and found
 ourselves in a room of moderate dimensions, and which in its general
 character had much that might be familiar to the associations of a visitor
 from the upper world. There were shelves on the wall containing what
 appeared to be books, and indeed were so; mostly very small, like our
 diamond duodecimos, shaped in the fashion of our volumes, and bound in
 sheets of fine metal. There were several curious-looking pieces of
 mechanism scattered about, apparently models, such as might be seen in the
 study of any professional mechanician. Four automata (mechanical
 contrivances which, with these people, answer the ordinary purposes of
 domestic service) stood phantom-like at each angle in the wall. In a
 recess was a low couch, or bed with pillows. A window, with curtains of
 some fibrous material drawn aside, opened upon a large balcony. My host
 stepped out into the balcony; I followed him. We were on the uppermost
 story of one of the angular pyramids; the view beyond was of a wild and
 solemn beauty impossible to describe:?the vast ranges of precipitous
 rock which formed the distant background, the intermediate valleys of
 mystic many-coloured herbiage, the flash of waters, many of them like
 streams of roseate flame, the serene lustre diffused over all by myriads
 of lamps, combined to form a whole of which no words of mine can convey
 adequate description; so splendid was it, yet so sombre; so lovely, yet so
 awful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But my attention was soon diverted from these nether landscapes. Suddenly
 there arose, as from the streets below, a burst of joyous music; then a
 winged form soared into the space; another as if in chase of the first,
 another and another; others after others, till the crowd grew thick and
 the number countless. But how describe the fantastic grace of these forms
 in their undulating movements! They appeared engaged in some sport or
 amusement; now forming into opposite squadrons; now scattering; now each
 group threading the other, soaring, descending, interweaving, severing;
 all in measured time to the music below, as if in the dance of the fabled
 Peri.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I turned my gaze on my host in a feverish wonder. I ventured to place my
 hand on the large wings that lay folded on his breast, and in doing so a
 slight shock as of electricity passed through me. I recoiled in fear; my
 host smiled, and as if courteously to gratify my curiosity, slowly
 expanded his pinions. I observed that his garment beneath them became
 dilated as a bladder that fills with air. The arms seemed to slide into
 the wings, and in another moment he had launched himself into the luminous
 atmosphere, and hovered there, still, and with outspread wings, as an
 eagle that basks in the sun. Then, rapidly as an eagle swoops, he rushed
 downwards into the midst of one of the groups, skimming through the midst,
 and as suddenly again soaring aloft. Thereon, three forms, in one of which
 I thought to recognise my host's daughter, detached themselves from the
 rest, and followed him as a bird sportively follows a bird. My eyes,
 dazzled with the lights and bewildered by the throngs, ceased to
 distinguish the gyrations and evolutions of these winged playmates, till
 presently my host re-emerged from the crowd and alighted at my side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The strangeness of all I had seen began now to operate fast on my senses;
 my mind itself began to wander. Though not inclined to be superstitious,
 nor hitherto believing that man could be brought into bodily communication
 with demons, I felt the terror and the wild excitement with which, in the
 Gothic ages, a traveller might have persuaded himself that he witnessed a
 'sabbat' of fiends and witches. I have a vague recollection of having
 attempted with vehement gesticulation, and forms of exorcism, and loud
 incoherent words, to repel my courteous and indulgent host; of his mild
 endeavors to calm and soothe me; of his intelligent conjecture that my
 fright and bewilderment were occasioned by the difference of form and
 movement between us which the wings that had excited my marvelling
 curiosity had, in exercise, made still more strongly perceptible; of the
 gentle smile with which he had sought to dispel my alarm by dropping the
 wings to the ground and endeavouring to show me that they were but a
 mechanical contrivance. That sudden transformation did but increase my
 horror, and as extreme fright often shows itself by extreme daring, I
 sprang at his throat like a wild beast. On an instant I was felled to the
 ground as by an electric shock, and the last confused images floating
 before my sight ere I became wholly insensible, were the form of my host
 kneeling beside me with one hand on my forehead, and the beautiful calm
 face of his daughter, with large, deep, inscrutable eyes intently fixed
 upon my own.

 Chapter VI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I remained in this unconscious state, as I afterwards learned, for many
 days, even for some weeks according to our computation of time. When I
 recovered I was in a strange room, my host and all his family were
 gathered round me, and to my utter amaze my host's daughter accosted me in
 my own language with a slightly foreign accent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you feel?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was some moments before I could overcome my surprise enough to falter
 out, "You know my language? How? Who and what are you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host smiled and motioned to one of his sons, who then took from a table
 a number of thin metallic sheets on which were traced drawings of various
 figures?a house, a tree, a bird, a man, &amp;c.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In these designs I recognised my own style of drawing. Under each figure
 was written the name of it in my language, and in my writing; and in
 another handwriting a word strange to me beneath it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Said the host, "Thus we began; and my daughter Zee, who belongs to the
 College of Sages, has been your instructress and ours too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zee then placed before me other metallic sheets, on which, in my writing,
 words first, and then sentences, were inscribed. Under each word and each
 sentence strange characters in another hand. Rallying my senses, I
 comprehended that thus a rude dictionary had been effected. Had it been
 done while I was dreaming? "That is enough now," said Zee, in a tone of
 command. "Repose and take food."

 <h2>
 Chapter VII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 A room to myself was assigned to me in this vast edifice. It was prettily
 and fantastically arranged, but without any of the splendour of metal-work
 or gems which was displayed in the more public apartments. The walls were
 hung with a variegated matting made from the stalks and fibers of plants,
 and the floor carpeted with the same.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bed was without curtains, its supports of iron resting on balls of
 crystal; the coverings, of a thin white substance resembling cotton. There
 were sundry shelves containing books. A curtained recess communicated with
 an aviary filled with singing?birds, of which I did not recognise
 one resembling those I have seen on earth, except a beautiful species of
 dove, though this was distinguished from our doves by a tall crest of
 bluish plumes. All these birds had been trained to sing in artful tunes,
 and greatly exceeded the skill of our piping bullfinches, which can rarely
 achieve more than two tunes, and cannot, I believe, sing those in concert.
 One might have supposed one's self at an opera in listening to the voices
 in my aviary. There were duets and trios, and quartetts and choruses, all
 arranged as in one piece of music. Did I want silence from the birds? I
 had but to draw a curtain over the aviary, and their song hushed as they
 found themselves left in the dark. Another opening formed a window, not
 glazed, but on touching a spring, a shutter ascended from the floor,
 formed of some substance less transparent than glass, but still
 sufficiently pellucid to allow a softened view of the scene without. To
 this window was attached a balcony, or rather hanging garden, wherein grew
 many graceful plants and brilliant flowers. The apartment and its
 appurtenances had thus a character, if strange in detail, still familiar,
 as a whole, to modern notions of luxury, and would have excited admiration
 if found attached to the apartments of an English duchess or a fashionable
 French author. Before I arrived this was Zee's chamber; she had hospitably
 assigned it to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some hours after the waking up which is described in my last chapter, I
 was lying alone on my couch trying to fix my thoughts on conjecture as to
 the nature and genus of the people amongst whom I was thrown, when my host
 and his daughter Zee entered the room. My host, still speaking my native
 language, inquired with much politeness, whether it would be agreeable to
 me to converse, or if I preferred solitude. I replied, that I should feel
 much honoured and obliged by the opportunity offered me to express my
 gratitude for the hospitality and civilities I had received in a country
 to which I was a stranger, and to learn enough of its customs and manners
 not to offend through ignorance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I spoke, I had of course risen from my couch: but Zee, much to my
 confusion, curtly ordered me to lie down again, and there was something in
 her voice and eye, gentle as both were, that compelled my obedience. She
 then seated herself unconcernedly at the foot of my bed, while her father
 took his place on a divan a few feet distant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what part of the world do you come from?" asked my host, "that we
 should appear so strange to you and you to us? I have seen individual
 specimens of nearly all the races differing from our own, except the
 primeval savages who dwell in the most desolate and remote recesses of
 uncultivated nature, unacquainted with other light than that they obtain
 from volcanic fires, and contented to grope their way in the dark, as do
 many creeping, crawling and flying things. But certainly you cannot be a
 member of those barbarous tribes, nor, on the other hand, do you seem to
 belong to any civilised people."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was somewhat nettled at this last observation, and replied that I had
 the honour to belong to one of the most civilised nations of the earth;
 and that, so far as light was concerned, while I admired the ingenuity and
 disregard of expense with which my host and his fellow-citizens had
 contrived to illumine the regions unpenetrated by the rays of the sun, yet
 I could not conceive how any who had once beheld the orbs of heaven could
 compare to their lustre the artificial lights invented by the necessities
 of man. But my host said he had seen specimens of most of the races
 differing from his own, save the wretched barbarians he had mentioned.
 Now, was it possible that he had never been on the surface of the earth,
 or could he only be referring to communities buried within its entrails?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host was for some moments silent; his countenance showed a degree of
 surprise which the people of that race very rarely manifest under any
 circumstances, howsoever extraordinary. But Zee was more intelligent, and
 exclaimed, "So you see, my father, that there is truth in the old
 tradition; there always is truth in every tradition commonly believed in
 all times and by all tribes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Zee," said my host mildly, "you belong to the College of Sages, and ought
 to be wiser than I am; but, as chief of the Light-preserving Council, it
 is my duty to take nothing for granted till it is proved to the evidence
 of my own senses." Then, turning to me, he asked me several questions
 about the surface of the earth and the heavenly bodies; upon which, though
 I answered him to the best of my knowledge, my answers seemed not to
 satisfy nor convince him. He shook his head quietly, and, changing the
 subject rather abruptly, asked how I had come down from what he was
 pleased to call one world to the other. I answered, that under the surface
 of the earth there were mines containing minerals, or metals, essential to
 our wants and our progress in all arts and industries; and I then briefly
 explained the manner in which, while exploring one of those mines, I and
 my ill-fated friend had obtained a glimpse of the regions into which we
 had descended, and how the descent had cost him his life; appealing to the
 rope and grappling-hooks that the child had brought to the house in which
 I had been at first received, as a witness of the truthfulness of my
 story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host then proceeded to question me as to the habits and modes of life
 among the races on the upper earth, more especially among those considered
 to be the most advanced in that civilisation which he was pleased to
 define "the art of diffusing throughout a community the tranquil happiness
 which belongs to a virtuous and well-ordered household." Naturally
 desiring to represent in the most favourable colours the world from which
 I came, I touched but slightly, though indulgently, on the antiquated and
 decaying institutions of Europe, in order to expatiate on the present
 grandeur and prospective pre-eminence of that glorious American Republic,
 in which Europe enviously seeks its model and tremblingly foresees its
 doom. Selecting for an example of the social life of the United States
 that city in which progress advances at the fastest rate, I indulged in an
 animated description of the moral habits of New York. Mortified to see, by
 the faces of my listeners, that I did not make the favourable impression I
 had anticipated, I elevated my theme; dwelling on the excellence of
 democratic institutions, their promotion of tranquil happiness by the
 government of party, and the mode in which they diffused such happiness
 throughout the community by preferring, for the exercise of power and the
 acquisition of honours, the lowliest citizens in point of property,
 education, and character. Fortunately recollecting the peroration of a
 speech, on the purifying influences of American democracy and their
 destined spread over the world, made by a certain eloquent senator (for
 whose vote in the Senate a Railway Company, to which my two brothers
 belonged, had just paid 20,000 dollars), I wound up by repeating its
 glowing predictions of the magnificent future that smiled upon mankind?when
 the flag of freedom should float over an entire continent, and two hundred
 millions of intelligent citizens, accustomed from infancy to the daily use
 of revolvers, should apply to a cowering universe the doctrine of the
 Patriot Monroe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I had concluded, my host gently shook his head, and fell into a
 musing study, making a sign to me and his daughter to remain silent while
 he reflected. And after a time he said, in a very earnest and solemn tone,
 "If you think as you say, that you, though a stranger, have received
 kindness at the hands of me and mine, I adjure you to reveal nothing to
 any other of our people respecting the world from which you came, unless,
 on consideration, I give you permission to do so. Do you consent to this
 request?" "Of course I pledge my word, to it," said I, somewhat amazed;
 and I extended my right hand to grasp his. But he placed my hand gently on
 his forehead and his own right hand on my breast, which is the custom
 amongst this race in all matters of promise or verbal obligations. Then
 turning to his daughter, he said, "And you, Zee, will not repeat to any
 one what the stranger has said, or may say, to me or to you, of a world
 other than our own." Zee rose and kissed her father on the temples,
 saying, with a smile, "A Gy's tongue is wanton, but love can fetter it
 fast. And if, my father, you fear lest a chance word from me or yourself
 could expose our community to danger, by a desire to explore a world
 beyond us, will not a wave of the 'vril,' properly impelled, wash even the
 memory of what we have heard the stranger say out of the tablets of the
 brain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the vril?" I asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Therewith Zee began to enter into an explanation of which I understood
 very little, for there is no word in any language I know which is an exact
 synonym for vril. I should call it electricity, except that it comprehends
 in its manifold branches other forces of nature, to which, in our
 scientific nomenclature, differing names are assigned, such as magnetism,
 galvanism, &amp;c. These people consider that in vril they have arrived at
 the unity in natural energetic agencies, which has been conjectured by
 many philosophers above ground, and which Faraday thus intimates under the
 more cautious term of correlation:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have long held an opinion," says that illustrious experimentalist,
 "almost amounting to a conviction, in common, I believe, with many other
 lovers of natural knowledge, that the various forms under which the forces
 of matter are made manifest, have one common origin; or, in other words,
 are so directly related and mutually dependent that they are convertible,
 as it were into one another, and possess equivalents of power in their
 action. These subterranean philosophers assert that by one operation of
 vril, which Faraday would perhaps call 'atmospheric magnetism,' they can
 influence the variations of temperature?in plain words, the weather;
 that by operations, akin to those ascribed to mesmerism, electro-biology,
 odic force, &amp;c., but applied scientifically, through vril conductors,
 they can exercise influence over minds, and bodies animal and vegetable,
 to an extent not surpassed in the romances of our mystics. To all such
 agencies they give the common name of vril."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zee asked me if, in my world, it was not known that all the faculties of
 the mind could be quickened to a degree unknown in the waking state, by
 trance or vision, in which the thoughts of one brain could be transmitted
 to another, and knowledge be thus rapidly interchanged. I replied, that
 there were amongst us stories told of such trance or vision, and that I
 had heard much and seen something in mesmeric clairvoyance; but that these
 practices had fallen much into disuse or contempt, partly because of the
 gross impostures to which they had been made subservient, and partly
 because, even where the effects upon certain abnormal constitutions were
 genuinely produced, the effects when fairly examined and analysed, were
 very unsatisfactory?not to be relied upon for any systematic
 truthfulness or any practical purpose, and rendered very mischievous to
 credulous persons by the superstitions they tended to produce. Zee
 received my answers with much benignant attention, and said that similar
 instances of abuse and credulity had been familiar to their own scientific
 experience in the infancy of their knowledge, and while the properties of
 vril were misapprehended, but that she reserved further discussion on this
 subject till I was more fitted to enter into it. She contented herself
 with adding, that it was through the agency of vril, while I had been
 placed in the state of trance, that I had been made acquainted with the
 rudiments of their language; and that she and her father, who alone of the
 family, took the pains to watch the experiment, had acquired a greater
 proportionate knowledge of my language than I of their own; partly because
 my language was much simpler than theirs, comprising far less of complex
 ideas; and partly because their organisation was, by hereditary culture,
 much more ductile and more readily capable of acquiring knowledge than
 mine. At this I secretly demurred; and having had in the course of a
 practical life, to sharpen my wits, whether at home or in travel, I could
 not allow that my cerebral organisation could possibly be duller than that
 of people who had lived all their lives by lamplight. However, while I was
 thus thinking, Zee quietly pointed her forefinger at my forehead, and sent
 me to sleep.

 Chapter VIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 When I once more awoke I saw by my bed-side the child who had brought the
 rope and grappling-hooks to the house in which I had been first received,
 and which, as I afterwards learned, was the residence of the chief
 magistrate of the tribe. The child, whose name was Taee (pronounced
 Tar-ee), was the magistrate's eldest son. I found that during my last
 sleep or trance I had made still greater advance in the language of the
 country, and could converse with comparative ease and fluency.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This child was singularly handsome, even for the beautiful race to which
 he belonged, with a countenance very manly in aspect for his years, and
 with a more vivacious and energetic expression than I had hitherto seen in
 the serene and passionless faces of the men. He brought me the tablet on
 which I had drawn the mode of my descent, and had also sketched the head
 of the horrible reptile that had scared me from my friend's corpse.
 Pointing to that part of the drawing, Taee put to me a few questions
 respecting the size and form of the monster, and the cave or chasm from
 which it had emerged. His interest in my answers seemed so grave as to
 divert him for a while from any curiosity as to myself or my antecedents.
 But to my great embarrassment, seeing how I was pledged to my host, he was
 just beginning to ask me where I came from, when Zee, fortunately entered,
 and, overhearing him, said, "Taee, give to our guest any information he
 may desire, but ask none from him in return. To question him who he is,
 whence he comes, or wherefore he is here, would be a breach of the law
 which my father has laid down in this house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So be it," said Taee, pressing his hand to his breast; and from that
 moment, till the one in which I saw him last, this child, with whom I
 became very intimate, never once put to me any of the questions thus
 interdicted.

 <h2>
 Chapter IX.
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was not for some time, and until, by repeated trances, if they are to
 be so called, my mind became better prepared to interchange ideas with my
 entertainers, and more fully to comprehend differences of manners and
 customs, at first too strange to my experience to be seized by my reason,
 that I was enabled to gather the following details respecting the origin
 and history of the subterranean population, as portion of one great family
 race called the Ana.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 According to the earliest traditions, the remote progenitors of the race
 had once tenanted a world above the surface of that in which their
 descendants dwelt. Myths of that world were still preserved in their
 archives, and in those myths were legends of a vaulted dome in which the
 lamps were lighted by no human hand. But such legends were considered by
 most commentators as allegorical fables. According to these traditions the
 earth itself, at the date to which the traditions ascend, was not indeed
 in its infancy, but in the throes and travail of transition from one form
 of development to another, and subject to many violent revolutions of
 nature. By one of such revolutions, that portion of the upper world
 inhabited by the ancestors of this race had been subjected to inundations,
 not rapid, but gradual and uncontrollable, in which all, save a scanty
 remnant, were submerged and perished. Whether this be a record of our
 historical and sacred Deluge, or of some earlier one contended for by
 geologists, I do not pretend to conjecture; though, according to the
 chronology of this people as compared with that of Newton, it must have
 been many thousands of years before the time of Noah. On the other hand,
 the account of these writers does not harmonise with the opinions most in
 vogue among geological authorities, inasmuch as it places the existence of
 a human race upon earth at dates long anterior to that assigned to the
 terrestrial formation adapted to the introduction of mammalia. A band of
 the ill-fated race, thus invaded by the Flood, had, during the march of
 the waters, taken refuge in caverns amidst the loftier rocks, and,
 wandering through these hollows, they lost sight of the upper world
 forever. Indeed, the whole face of the earth had been changed by this
 great revulsion; land had been turned into sea?sea into land. In the
 bowels of the inner earth, even now, I was informed as a positive fact,
 might be discovered the remains of human habitation?habitation not
 in huts and caverns, but in vast cities whose ruins attest the
 civilisation of races which flourished before the age of Noah, and are not
 to be classified with those genera to which philosophy ascribes the use of
 flint and the ignorance of iron.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fugitives had carried with them the knowledge of the arts they had
 practised above ground?arts of culture and civilisation. Their
 earliest want must have been that of supplying below the earth the light
 they had lost above it; and at no time, even in the traditional period, do
 the races, of which the one I now sojourned with formed a tribe, seem to
 have been unacquainted with the art of extracting light from gases, or
 manganese, or petroleum. They had been accustomed in their former state to
 contend with the rude forces of nature; and indeed the lengthened battle
 they had fought with their conqueror Ocean, which had taken centuries in
 its spread, had quickened their skill in curbing waters into dikes and
 channels. To this skill they owed their preservation in their new abode.
 "For many generations," said my host, with a sort of contempt and horror,
 "these primitive forefathers are said to have degraded their rank and
 shortened their lives by eating the flesh of animals, many varieties of
 which had, like themselves, escaped the Deluge, and sought shelter in the
 hollows of the earth; other animals, supposed to be unknown to the upper
 world, those hollows themselves produced."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When what we should term the historical age emerged from the twilight of
 tradition, the Ana were already established in different communities, and
 had attained to a degree of civilisation very analogous to that which the
 more advanced nations above the earth now enjoy. They were familiar with
 most of our mechanical inventions, including the application of steam as
 well as gas. The communities were in fierce competition with each other.
 They had their rich and their poor; they had orators and conquerors; they
 made war either for a domain or an idea. Though the various states
 acknowledged various forms of government, free institutions were beginning
 to preponderate; popular assemblies increased in power; republics soon
 became general; the democracy to which the most enlightened European
 politicians look forward as the extreme goal of political advancement, and
 which still prevailed among other subterranean races, whom they despised
 as barbarians, the loftier family of Ana, to which belonged the tribe I
 was visiting, looked back to as one of the crude and ignorant experiments
 which belong to the infancy of political science. It was the age of envy
 and hate, of fierce passions, of constant social changes more or less
 violent, of strife between classes, of war between state and state. This
 phase of society lasted, however, for some ages, and was finally brought
 to a close, at least among the nobler and more intellectual populations,
 by the gradual discovery of the latent powers stored in the all-permeating
 fluid which they denominate Vril.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 According to the account I received from Zee, who, as an erudite professor
 of the College of Sages, had studied such matters more diligently than any
 other member of my host's family, this fluid is capable of being raised
 and disciplined into the mightiest agency over all forms of matter,
 animate or inanimate. It can destroy like the flash of lightning; yet,
 differently applied, it can replenish or invigorate life, heal, and
 preserve, and on it they chiefly rely for the cure of disease, or rather
 for enabling the physical organisation to re-establish the due equilibrium
 of its natural powers, and thereby to cure itself. By this agency they
 rend way through the most solid substances, and open valleys for culture
 through the rocks of their subterranean wilderness. From it they extract
 the light which supplies their lamps, finding it steadier, softer, and
 healthier than the other inflammable materials they had formerly used.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the effects of the alleged discovery of the means to direct the more
 terrible force of vril were chiefly remarkable in their influence upon
 social polity. As these effects became familiarly known and skillfully
 administered, war between the vril-discoverers ceased, for they brought
 the art of destruction to such perfection as to annul all superiority in
 numbers, discipline, or military skill. The fire lodged in the hollow of a
 rod directed by the hand of a child could shatter the strongest fortress,
 or cleave its burning way from the van to the rear of an embattled host.
 If army met army, and both had command of this agency, it could be but to
 the annihilation of each. The age of war was therefore gone, but with the
 cessation of war other effects bearing upon the social state soon became
 apparent. Man was so completely at the mercy of man, each whom he
 encountered being able, if so willing, to slay him on the instant, that
 all notions of government by force gradually vanished from political
 systems and forms of law. It is only by force that vast communities,
 dispersed through great distances of space, can be kept together; but now
 there was no longer either the necessity of self-preservation or the pride
 of aggrandisement to make one state desire to preponderate in population
 over another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Vril-discoverers thus, in the course of a few generations, peacefully
 split into communities of moderate size. The tribe amongst which I had
 fallen was limited to 12,000 families. Each tribe occupied a territory
 sufficient for all its wants, and at stated periods the surplus population
 departed to seek a realm of its own. There appeared no necessity for any
 arbitrary selection of these emigrants; there was always a sufficient
 number who volunteered to depart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These subdivided states, petty if we regard either territory or
 population,?all appertained to one vast general family. They spoke
 the same language, though the dialects might slightly differ. They
 intermarried; They maintained the same general laws and customs; and so
 important a bond between these several communities was the knowledge of
 vril and the practice of its agencies, that the word A-Vril was synonymous
 with civilisation; and Vril-ya, signifying "The Civilised Nations," was
 the common name by which the communities employing the uses of vril
 distinguished themselves from such of the Ana as were yet in a state of
 barbarism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The government of the tribe of Vril-ya I am treating of was apparently
 very complicated, really very simple. It was based upon a principle
 recognised in theory, though little carried out in practice, above ground?viz.,
 that the object of all systems of philosophical thought tends to the
 attainment of unity, or the ascent through all intervening labyrinths to
 the simplicity of a single first cause or principle. Thus in politics,
 even republican writers have agreed that a benevolent autocracy would
 insure the best administration, if there were any guarantees for its
 continuance, or against its gradual abuse of the powers accorded to it.
 This singular community elected therefore a single supreme magistrate
 styled Tur; he held his office nominally for life, but he could seldom be
 induced to retain it after the first approach of old age. There was indeed
 in this society nothing to induce any of its members to covet the cares of
 office. No honours, no insignia of higher rank, were assigned to it. The
 supreme magistrate was not distinguished from the rest by superior
 habitation or revenue. On the other hand, the duties awarded to him were
 marvellously light and easy, requiring no preponderant degree of energy or
 intelligence. There being no apprehensions of war, there were no armies to
 maintain; there being no government of force, there was no police to
 appoint and direct. What we call crime was utterly unknown to the Vril-ya;
 and there were no courts of criminal justice. The rare instances of civil
 disputes were referred for arbitration to friends chosen by either party,
 or decided by the Council of Sages, which will be described later. There
 were no professional lawyers; and indeed their laws were but amicable
 conventions, for there was no power to enforce laws against an offender
 who carried in his staff the power to destroy his judges. There were
 customs and regulations to compliance with which, for several ages, the
 people had tacitly habituated themselves; or if in any instance an
 individual felt such compliance hard, he quitted the community and went
 elsewhere. There was, in fact, quietly established amid this state, much
 the same compact that is found in our private families, in which we
 virtually say to any independent grown-up member of the family whom we
 receive to entertain, "Stay or go, according as our habits and regulations
 suit or displease you." But though there were no laws such as we call
 laws, no race above ground is so law-observing. Obedience to the rule
 adopted by the community has become as much an instinct as if it were
 implanted by nature. Even in every household the head of it makes a
 regulation for its guidance, which is never resisted nor even cavilled at
 by those who belong to the family. They have a proverb, the pithiness of
 which is much lost in this paraphrase, "No happiness without order, no
 order without authority, no authority without unity." The mildness of all
 government among them, civil or domestic, may be signalised by their
 idiomatic expressions for such terms as illegal or forbidden?viz.,
 "It is requested not to do so and so." Poverty among the Ana is as unknown
 as crime; not that property is held in common, or that all are equals in
 the extent of their possessions or the size and luxury of their
 habitations: but there being no difference of rank or position between the
 grades of wealth or the choice of occupations, each pursues his own
 inclinations without creating envy or vying; some like a modest, some a
 more splendid kind of life; each makes himself happy in his own way. Owing
 to this absence of competition, and the limit placed on the population, it
 is difficult for a family to fall into distress; there are no hazardous
 speculations, no emulators striving for superior wealth and rank. No
 doubt, in each settlement all originally had the same proportions of land
 dealt out to them; but some, more adventurous than others, had extended
 their possessions farther into the bordering wilds, or had improved into
 richer fertility the produce of their fields, or entered into commerce or
 trade. Thus, necessarily, some had grown richer than others, but none had
 become absolutely poor, or wanting anything which their tastes desired. If
 they did so, it was always in their power to migrate, or at the worst to
 apply, without shame and with certainty of aid, to the rich, for all the
 members of the community considered themselves as brothers of one
 affectionate and united family. More upon this head will be treated of
 incidentally as my narrative proceeds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The chief care of the supreme magistrate was to communicate with certain
 active departments charged with the administration of special details. The
 most important and essential of such details was that connected with the
 due provision of light. Of this department my host, Aph-Lin, was the
 chief. Another department, which might be called the foreign, communicated
 with the neighbouring kindred states, principally for the purpose of
 ascertaining all new inventions; and to a third department all such
 inventions and improvements in machinery were committed for trial.
 Connected with this department was the College of Sages?a college
 especially favoured by such of the Ana as were widowed and childless, and
 by the young unmarried females, amongst whom Zee was the most active, and,
 if what we call renown or distinction was a thing acknowledged by this
 people (which I shall later show it is not), among the more renowned or
 distinguished. It is by the female Professors of this College that those
 studies which are deemed of least use in practical life?as purely
 speculative philosophy, the history of remote periods, and such sciences
 as entomology, conchology, &amp;c.?are the more diligently
 cultivated. Zee, whose mind, active as Aristotle's, equally embraced the
 largest domains and the minutest details of thought, had written two
 volumes on the parasite insect that dwells amid the hairs of a tiger's*
 paw, which work was considered the best authority on that interesting
 subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * The animal here referred to has many points of difference from the tiger
 of the upper world. It is larger, and with a broader paw, and still more
 receding frontal. It haunts the side of lakes and pools, and feeds
 principally on fishes, though it does not object to any terrestrial animal
 of inferior strength that comes in its way. It is becoming very scarce
 even in the wild districts, where it is devoured by gigantic reptiles. I
 apprehended that it clearly belongs to the tiger species, since the
 parasite animalcule found in its paw, like that in the Asiatic tiger, is a
 miniature image of itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the researches of the sages are not confined to such subtle or elegant
 studies. They comprise various others more important, and especially the
 properties of vril, to the perception of which their finer nervous
 organisation renders the female Professors eminently keen. It is out of
 this college that the Tur, or chief magistrate, selects Councillors,
 limited to three, in the rare instances in which novelty of event or
 circumstance perplexes his own judgment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There are a few other departments of minor consequence, but all are
 carried on so noiselessly, and quietly that the evidence of a government
 seems to vanish altogether, and social order to be as regular and
 unobtrusive as if it were a law of nature. Machinery is employed to an
 inconceivable extent in all the operations of labour within and without
 doors, and it is the unceasing object of the department charged with its
 administration to extend its efficiency. There is no class of labourers or
 servants, but all who are required to assist or control the machinery are
 found in the children, from the time they leave the care of their mothers
 to the marriageable age, which they place at sixteen for the Gy-ei (the
 females), twenty for the Ana (the males). These children are formed into
 bands and sections under their own chiefs, each following the pursuits in
 which he is most pleased, or for which he feels himself most fitted. Some
 take to handicrafts, some to agriculture, some to household work, and some
 to the only services of danger to which the population is exposed; for the
 sole perils that threaten this tribe are, first, from those occasional
 convulsions within the earth, to foresee and guard against which tasks
 their utmost ingenuity?irruptions of fire and water, the storms of
 subterranean winds and escaping gases. At the borders of the domain, and
 at all places where such peril might be apprehended, vigilant inspectors
 are stationed with telegraphic communications to the hall in which chosen
 sages take it by turns to hold perpetual sittings. These inspectors are
 always selected from the elder boys approaching the age of puberty, and on
 the principle that at that age observation is more acute and the physical
 forces more alert than at any other. The second service of danger, less
 grave, is in the destruction of all creatures hostile to the life, or the
 culture, or even the comfort, of the Ana. Of these the most formidable are
 the vast reptiles, of some of which antediluvian relics are preserved in
 our museums, and certain gigantic winged creatures, half bird, half
 reptile. These, together with lesser wild animals, corresponding to our
 tigers or venomous serpents, it is left to the younger children to hunt
 and destroy; because, according to the Ana, here ruthlessness is wanted,
 and the younger the child the more ruthlessly he will destroy. There is
 another class of animals in the destruction of which discrimination is to
 be used, and against which children of intermediate age are
 appointed-animals that do not threaten the life of man, but ravage the
 produce of his labour, varieties of the elk and deer species, and a
 smaller creature much akin to our rabbit, though infinitely more
 destructive to crops, and much more cunning in its mode of depredation. It
 is the first object of these appointed infants, to tame the more
 intelligent of such animals into respect for enclosures signalised by
 conspicuous landmarks, as dogs are taught to respect a larder, or even to
 guard the master's property. It is only where such creatures are found
 untamable to this extent that they are destroyed. Life is never taken away
 for food or for sport, and never spared where untamably inimical to the
 Ana. Concomitantly with these bodily services and tasks, the mental
 education of the children goes on till boyhood ceases. It is the general
 custom, then, to pass though a course of instruction at the College of
 Sages, in which, besides more general studies, the pupil receives special
 lessons in such vocation or direction of intellect as he himself selects.
 Some, however, prefer to pass this period of probation in travel, or to
 emigrate, or to settle down at once into rural or commercial pursuits. No
 force is put upon individual inclination.

 <h2>
 Chapter X.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The word Ana (pronounced broadly 'Arna') corresponds with our plural
 'men;' An (pronounced 'Arn'), the singular, with 'man.' The word for woman
 is Gy (pronounced hard, as in Guy); it forms itself into Gy-ei for the
 plural, but the G becomes soft in the plural like Jy-ei. They have a
 proverb to the effect that this difference in pronunciation is symbolical,
 for that the female sex is soft in the concrete, but hard to deal with in
 the individual. The Gy-ei are in the fullest enjoyment of all the rights
 of equality with males, for which certain philosophers above ground
 contend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In childhood they perform the offices of work and labour impartially with
 the boys, and, indeed, in the earlier age appropriated to the destruction
 of animals irreclaimably hostile, the girls are frequently preferred, as
 being by constitution more ruthless under the influence of fear or hate.
 In the interval between infancy and the marriageable age familiar
 intercourse between the sexes is suspended. At the marriageable age it is
 renewed, never with worse consequences than those which attend upon
 marriage. All arts and vocations allotted to the one sex are open to the
 other, and the Gy-ei arrogate to themselves a superiority in all those
 abstruse and mystical branches of reasoning, for which they say the Ana
 are unfitted by a duller sobriety of understanding, or the routine of
 their matter-of-fact occupations, just as young ladies in our own world
 constitute themselves authorities in the subtlest points of theological
 doctrine, for which few men, actively engaged in worldly business have
 sufficient learning or refinement of intellect. Whether owing to early
 training in gymnastic exercises, or to their constitutional organisation,
 the Gy-ei are usually superior to the Ana in physical strength (an
 important element in the consideration and maintenance of female rights).
 They attain to loftier stature, and amid their rounder proportions are
 imbedded sinews and muscles as hardy as those of the other sex. Indeed
 they assert that, according to the original laws of nature, females were
 intended to be larger than males, and maintain this dogma by reference to
 the earliest formations of life in insects, and in the most ancient family
 of the vertebrata?viz., fishes?in both of which the females
 are generally large enough to make a meal of their consorts if they so
 desire. Above all, the Gy-ei have a readier and more concentred power over
 that mysterious fluid or agency which contains the element of destruction,
 with a larger portion of that sagacity which comprehends dissimulation.
 Thus they cannot only defend themselves against all aggressions from the
 males, but could, at any moment when he least expected his danger,
 terminate the existence of an offending spouse. To the credit of the Gy-ei
 no instance of their abuse of this awful superiority in the art of
 destruction is on record for several ages. The last that occurred in the
 community I speak of appears (according to their chronology) to have been
 about two thousand years ago. A Gy, then, in a fit of jealousy, slew her
 husband; and this abominable act inspired such terror among the males that
 they emigrated in a body and left all the Gy-ei to themselves. The history
 runs that the widowed Gy-ei, thus reduced to despair, fell upon the
 murderess when in her sleep (and therefore unarmed), and killed her, and
 then entered into a solemn obligation amongst themselves to abrogate
 forever the exercise of their extreme conjugal powers, and to inculcate
 the same obligation for ever and ever on their female children. By this
 conciliatory process, a deputation despatched to the fugitive consorts
 succeeded in persuading many to return, but those who did return were
 mostly the elder ones. The younger, either from too craven a doubt of
 their consorts, or too high an estimate of their own merits, rejected all
 overtures, and, remaining in other communities, were caught up there by
 other mates, with whom perhaps they were no better off. But the loss of so
 large a portion of the male youth operated as a salutary warning on the
 Gy-ei, and confirmed them in the pious resolution to which they pledged
 themselves. Indeed it is now popularly considered that, by long hereditary
 disuse, the Gy-ei have lost both the aggressive and defensive superiority
 over the Ana which they once possessed, just as in the inferior animals
 above the earth many peculiarities in their original formation, intended
 by nature for their protection, gradually fade or become inoperative when
 not needed under altered circumstances. I should be sorry, however, for
 any An who induced a Gy to make the experiment whether he or she were the
 stronger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the incident I have narrated, the Ana date certain alterations in the
 marriage customs, tending, perhaps, somewhat to the advantage of the male.
 They now bind themselves in wedlock only for three years; at the end of
 each third year either male or female can divorce the other and is free to
 marry again. At the end of ten years the An has the privilege of taking a
 second wife, allowing the first to retire if she so please. These
 regulations are for the most part a dead letter; divorces and polygamy are
 extremely rare, and the marriage state now seems singularly happy and
 serene among this astonishing people;?the Gy-ei, notwithstanding
 their boastful superiority in physical strength and intellectual
 abilities, being much curbed into gentle manners by the dread of
 separation or of a second wife, and the Ana being very much the creatures
 of custom, and not, except under great aggravation, likely to exchange for
 hazardous novelties faces and manners to which they are reconciled by
 habit. But there is one privilege the Gy-ei carefully retain, and the
 desire for which perhaps forms the secret motive of most lady asserters of
 woman rights above ground. They claim the privilege, here usurped by men,
 of proclaiming their love and urging their suit; in other words, of being
 the wooing party rather than the wooed. Such a phenomenon as an old maid
 does not exist among the Gy-ei. Indeed it is very seldom that a Gy does
 not secure any An upon whom she sets her heart, if his affections be not
 strongly engaged elsewhere. However coy, reluctant, and prudish, the male
 she courts may prove at first, yet her perseverance, her ardour, her
 persuasive powers, her command over the mystic agencies of vril, are
 pretty sure to run down his neck into what we call "the fatal noose."
 Their argument for the reversal of that relationship of the sexes which
 the blind tyranny of man has established on the surface of the earth,
 appears cogent, and is advanced with a frankness which might well be
 commended to impartial consideration. They say, that of the two the female
 is by nature of a more loving disposition than the male?that love
 occupies a larger space in her thoughts, and is more essential to her
 happiness, and that therefore she ought to be the wooing party; that
 otherwise the male is a shy and dubitant creature?that he has often
 a selfish predilection for the single state?that he often pretends
 to misunderstand tender glances and delicate hints?that, in short,
 he must be resolutely pursued and captured. They add, moreover, that
 unless the Gy can secure the An of her choice, and one whom she would not
 select out of the whole world becomes her mate, she is not only less happy
 than she otherwise would be, but she is not so good a being, that her
 qualities of heart are not sufficiently developed; whereas the An is a
 creature that less lastingly concentrates his affections on one object;
 that if he cannot get the Gy whom he prefers he easily reconciles himself
 to another Gy; and, finally, that at the worst, if he is loved and taken
 care of, it is less necessary to the welfare of his existence that he
 should love as well as be loved; he grows contented with his creature
 comforts, and the many occupations of thought which he creates for
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whatever may be said as to this reasoning, the system works well for the
 male; for being thus sure that he is truly and ardently loved, and that
 the more coy and reluctant he shows himself, the more determination to
 secure him increases, he generally contrives to make his consent dependent
 on such conditions as he thinks the best calculated to insure, if not a
 blissful, at least a peaceful life. Each individual An has his own
 hobbies, his own ways, his own predilections, and, whatever they may be,
 he demands a promise of full and unrestrained concession to them. This, in
 the pursuit of her object, the Gy readily promises; and as the
 characteristic of this extraordinary people is an implicit veneration for
 truth, and her word once given is never broken even by the giddiest Gy,
 the conditions stipulated for are religiously observed. In fact,
 notwithstanding all their abstract rights and powers, the Gy-ei are the
 most amiable, conciliatory, and submissive wives I have ever seen even in
 the happiest households above ground. It is an aphorism among them, that
 "where a Gy loves it is her pleasure to obey." It will be observed that in
 the relationship of the sexes I have spoken only of marriage, for such is
 the moral perfection to which this community has attained, that any
 illicit connection is as little possible amongst them as it would be to a
 couple of linnets during the time they agree to live in pairs.

 <h2>
 Chapter XI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Nothing had more perplexed me in seeking to reconcile my sense to the
 existence of regions extending below the surface of the earth, and
 habitable by beings, if dissimilar from, still, in all material points of
 organism, akin to those in the upper world, than the contradiction thus
 presented to the doctrine in which, I believe, most geologists and
 philosophers concur?viz., that though with us the sun is the great
 source of heat, yet the deeper we go beneath the crust of the earth, the
 greater is the increasing heat, being, it is said, found in the ratio of a
 degree for every foot, commencing from fifty feet below the surface. But
 though the domains of the tribe I speak of were, on the higher ground, so
 comparatively near to the surface, that I could account for a temperature,
 therein, suitable to organic life, yet even the ravines and valleys of
 that realm were much less hot than philosophers would deem possible at
 such a depth?certainly not warmer than the south of France, or at
 least of Italy. And according to all the accounts I received, vast tracts
 immeasurably deeper beneath the surface, and in which one might have
 thought only salamanders could exist, were inhabited by innumerable races
 organised like ourselves, I cannot pretend in any way to account for a
 fact which is so at variance with the recognised laws of science, nor
 could Zee much help me towards a solution of it. She did but conjecture
 that sufficient allowance had not been made by our philosophers for the
 extreme porousness of the interior earth?the vastness of its
 cavities and irregularities, which served to create free currents of air
 and frequent winds?and for the various modes in which heat is
 evaporated and thrown off. She allowed, however, that there was a depth at
 which the heat was deemed to be intolerable to such organised life as was
 known to the experience of the Vril-ya, though their philosophers believed
 that even in such places life of some kind, life sentient, life
 intellectual, would be found abundant and thriving, could the philosophers
 penetrate to it. "Wherever the All-Good builds," said she, "there, be
 sure, He places inhabitants. He loves not empty dwellings." She added,
 however, that many changes in temperature and climate had been effected by
 the skill of the Vril-ya, and that the agency of vril had been
 successfully employed in such changes. She described a subtle and
 life-giving medium called Lai, which I suspect to be identical with the
 ethereal oxygen of Dr. Lewins, wherein work all the correlative forces
 united under the name of vril; and contended that wherever this medium
 could be expanded, as it were, sufficiently for the various agencies of
 vril to have ample play, a temperature congenial to the highest forms of
 life could be secured. She said also, that it was the belief of their
 naturalists that flowers and vegetation had been produced originally
 (whether developed from seeds borne from the surface of the earth in the
 earlier convulsions of nature, or imported by the tribes that first sought
 refuge in cavernous hollows) through the operations of the light
 constantly brought to bear on them, and the gradual improvement in
 culture. She said also, that since the vril light had superseded all other
 light-giving bodies, the colours of flower and foliage had become more
 brilliant, and vegetation had acquired larger growth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leaving these matters to the consideration of those better competent to
 deal with them, I must now devote a few pages to the very interesting
 questions connected with the language of the Vril-ya.

 <h2>
 Chapter XII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The language of the Vril-ya is peculiarly interesting, because it seems to
 me to exhibit with great clearness the traces of the three main
 transitions through which language passes in attaining to perfection of
 form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the most illustrious of recent philologists, Max Muller, in arguing
 for the analogy between the strata of language and the strata of the
 earth, lays down this absolute dogma: "No language can, by any
 possibility, be inflectional without having passed through the
 agglutinative and isolating stratum. No language can be agglutinative
 without clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum of isolation."?'On
 the Stratification of Language,' p. 20.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taking then the Chinese language as the best existing type of the original
 isolating stratum, "as the faithful photograph of man in his
 leading-strings trying the muscles of his mind, groping his way, and so
 delighted with his first successful grasps that he repeats them again and
 again," (Max Muller, p. 3)?we have, in the language of the Vril-ya,
 still "clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum," the evidences
 of the original isolation. It abounds in monosyllables, which are the
 foundations of the language. The transition into the agglutinative form
 marks an epoch that must have gradually extended through ages, the written
 literature of which has only survived in a few fragments of symbolical
 mythology and certain pithy sentences which have passed into popular
 proverbs. With the extant literature of the Vril-ya the inflectional
 stratum commences. No doubt at that time there must have operated
 concurrent causes, in the fusion of races by some dominant people, and the
 rise of some great literary phenomena by which the form of language became
 arrested and fixed. As the inflectional stage prevailed over the
 agglutinative, it is surprising to see how much more boldly the original
 roots of the language project from the surface that conceals them. In the
 old fragments and proverbs of the preceding stage the monosyllables which
 compose those roots vanish amidst words of enormous length, comprehending
 whole sentences from which no one part can be disentangled from the other
 and employed separately. But when the inflectional form of language became
 so far advanced as to have its scholars and grammarians, they seem to have
 united in extirpating all such polysynthetical or polysyllabic monsters,
 as devouring invaders of the aboriginal forms. Words beyond three
 syllables became proscribed as barbarous and in proportion as the language
 grew thus simplified it increased in strength, in dignity, and in
 sweetness. Though now very compressed in sound, it gains in clearness by
 that compression. By a single letter, according to its position, they
 contrive to express all that with civilised nations in our upper world it
 takes the waste, sometimes of syllables, sometimes of sentences, to
 express. Let me here cite one or two instances: An (which I will translate
 man), Ana (men); the letter 's' is with them a letter implying multitude,
 according to where it is placed; Sana means mankind; Ansa, a multitude of
 men. The prefix of certain letters in their alphabet invariably denotes
 compound significations. For instance, Gl (which with them is a single
 letter, as 'th' is a single letter with the Greeks) at the commencement of
 a word infers an assemblage or union of things, sometimes kindred,
 sometimes dissimilar?as Oon, a house; Gloon, a town (i. e., an
 assemblage of houses). Ata is sorrow; Glata, a public calamity. Aur-an is
 the health or wellbeing of a man; Glauran, the wellbeing of the state, the
 good of the community; and a word constantly in ther mouths is A-glauran,
 which denotes their political creed?viz., that "the first principle
 of a community is the good of all." Aub is invention; Sila, a tone in
 music. Glaubsila, as uniting the ideas of invention and of musical
 intonation, is the classical word for poetry?abbreviated, in
 ordinary conversation, to Glaubs. Na, which with them is, like Gl, but a
 single letter, always, when an initial, implies something antagonistic to
 life or joy or comfort, resembling in this the Aryan root Nak, expressive
 of perishing or destruction. Nax is darkness; Narl, death; Naria, sin or
 evil. Nas?an uttermost condition of sin and evil?corruption.
 In writing, they deem it irreverent to express the Supreme Being by any
 special name. He is symbolized by what may be termed the heiroglyphic of a
 pyramid, /\. In prayer they address Him by a name which they deem too
 sacred to confide to a stranger, and I know it not. In conversation they
 generally use a periphrastic epithet, such as the All-Good. The letter V,
 symbolical of the inverted pyramid, where it is an initial, nearly always
 denotes excellence of power; as Vril, of which I have said so much; Veed,
 an immortal spirit; Veed-ya, immortality; Koom, pronounced like the Welsh
 Cwm, denotes something of hollowness. Koom itself is a cave; Koom-in, a
 hole; Zi-koom, a valley; Koom-zi, vacancy or void; Bodh-koom, ignorance
 (literally, knowledge-void). Koom-posh is their name for the government of
 the many, or the ascendancy of the most ignorant or hollow. Posh is an
 almost untranslatable idiom, implying, as the reader will see later,
 contempt. The closest rendering I can give to it is our slang term,
 "bosh;" and this Koom-Posh may be loosely rendered "Hollow-Bosh." But when
 Democracy or Koom-Posh degenerates from popular ignorance into that
 popular passion or ferocity which precedes its decease, as (to cite
 illustrations from the upper world) during the French Reign of Terror, or
 for the fifty years of the Roman Republic preceding the ascendancy of
 Augustus, their name for that state of things is Glek-Nas. Ek is strife?Glek,
 the universal strife. Nas, as I before said, is corruption or rot; thus,
 Glek-Nas may be construed, "the universal strife-rot." Their compounds are
 very expressive; thus, Bodh being knowledge, and Too a participle that
 implies the action of cautiously approaching,?Too-bodh is their word
 for Philosophy; Pah is a contemptuous exclamation analogous to our idiom,
 "stuff and nonsense;" Pah-bodh (literally stuff and nonsense-knowledge) is
 their term for futile and false philosophy, and applied to a species of
 metaphysical or speculative ratiocination formerly in vogue, which
 consisted in making inquiries that could not be answered, and were not
 worth making; such, for instance, as "Why does an An have five toes to his
 feet instead of four or six? Did the first An, created by the All-Good,
 have the same number of toes as his descendants? In the form by which an
 An will be recognised by his friends in the future state of being, will he
 retain any toes at all, and, if so, will they be material toes or
 spiritual toes?" I take these illustrations of Pahbodh, not in irony or
 jest, but because the very inquiries I name formed the subject of
 controversy by the latest cultivators of that 'science,'?4000 years
 ago.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the declension of nouns I was informed that anciently there were eight
 cases (one more than in the Sanskrit Grammar); but the effect of time has
 been to reduce these cases, and multiply, instead of these varying
 terminations, explanatory propositions. At present, in the Grammar
 submitted to my study, there were four cases to nouns, three having
 varying terminations, and the fourth a differing prefix.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> SINGULAR. PLURAL.
 Nom. An, Man, | Nom. Ana, Men.
 Dat. Ano, to Man, | Dat. Anoi, to Men.
 Ac. Anan, Man, | Ac. Ananda, Men.
 Voc. Hil-an, O Man, | Voc. Hil-Ananda, O Men.
</pre>
 <p>
 In the elder inflectional literature the dual form existed?it has
 long been obsolete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The genitive case with them is also obsolete; the dative supplies its
 place: they say the House 'to' a Man, instead of the House 'of' a Man.
 When used (sometimes in poetry), the genitive in the termination is the
 same as the nominative; so is the ablative, the preposition that marks it
 being a prefix or suffix at option, and generally decided by ear,
 according to the sound of the noun. It will be observed that the prefix
 Hil marks the vocative case. It is always retained in addressing another,
 except in the most intimate domestic relations; its omission would be
 considered rude: just as in our of forms of speech in addressing a king it
 would have been deemed disrespectful to say "King," and reverential to say
 "O King." In fact, as they have no titles of honour, the vocative
 adjuration supplies the place of a title, and is given impartially to all.
 The prefix Hil enters into the composition of words that imply distant
 communications, as Hil-ya, to travel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the conjugation of their verbs, which is much too lengthy a subject to
 enter on here, the auxiliary verb Ya, "to go," which plays so considerable
 part in the Sanskrit, appears and performs a kindred office, as if it were
 a radical in some language from which both had descended. But another
 auxiliary or opposite signification also accompanies it and shares its
 labours?viz., Zi, to stay or repose. Thus Ya enters into the future
 tense, and Zi in the preterite of all verbs requiring auxiliaries. Yam, I
 shall go?Yiam, I may go?Yani-ya, I shall go (literally, I go
 to go), Zam-poo-yan, I have gone (literally, I rest from gone). Ya, as a
 termination, implies by analogy, progress, movement, efflorescence. Zi, as
 a terminal, denotes fixity, sometimes in a good sense, sometimes in a bad,
 according to the word with which it is coupled. Iva-zi, eternal goodness;
 Nan-zi, eternal evil. Poo (from) enters as a prefix to words that denote
 repugnance, or things from which we ought to be averse. Poo-pra, disgust;
 Poo-naria, falsehood, the vilest kind of evil. Poosh or Posh I have
 already confessed to be untranslatable literally. It is an expression of
 contempt not unmixed with pity. This radical seems to have originated from
 inherent sympathy between the labial effort and the sentiment that
 impelled it, Poo being an utterance in which the breath is exploded from
 the lips with more or less vehemence. On the other hand, Z, when an
 initial, is with them a sound in which the breath is sucked inward, and
 thus Zu, pronounced Zoo (which in their language is one letter), is the
 ordinary prefix to words that signify something that attracts, pleases,
 touches the heart?as Zummer, lover; Zutze, love; Zuzulia, delight.
 This indrawn sound of Z seems indeed naturally appropriate to fondness.
 Thus, even in our language, mothers say to their babies, in defiance of
 grammar, "Zoo darling;" and I have heard a learned professor at Boston
 call his wife (he had been only married a month) "Zoo little pet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I cannot quit this subject, however, without observing by what slight
 changes in the dialects favoured by different tribes of the same race, the
 original signification and beauty of sounds may become confused and
 deformed. Zee told me with much indignation that Zummer (lover) which in
 the way she uttered it, seemed slowly taken down to the very depths of her
 heart, was, in some not very distant communities of the Vril-ya, vitiated
 into the half-hissing, half-nasal, wholly disagreeable, sound of Subber. I
 thought to myself it only wanted the introduction of 'n' before 'u' to
 render it into an English word significant of the last quality an amorous
 Gy would desire in her Zummer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I will but mention another peculiarity in this language which gives equal
 force and brevity to its forms of expressions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A is with them, as with us, the first letter of the alphabet, and is often
 used as a prefix word by itself to convey a complex idea of sovereignty or
 chiefdom, or presiding principle. For instance, Iva is goodness; Diva,
 goodness and happiness united; A-Diva is unerring and absolute truth. I
 have already noticed the value of A in A-glauran, so, in vril (to whose
 properties they trace their present state of civilisation), A-vril,
 denotes, as I have said, civilisation itself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The philologist will have seen from the above how much the language of the
 Vril-ya is akin to the Aryan or Indo-Germanic; but, like all languages, it
 contains words and forms in which transfers from very opposite sources of
 speech have been taken. The very title of Tur, which they give to their
 supreme magistrate, indicates theft from a tongue akin to the Turanian.
 They say themselves that this is a foreign word borrowed from a title
 which their historical records show to have been borne by the chief of a
 nation with whom the ancestors of the Vril-ya were, in very remote
 periods, on friendly terms, but which has long become extinct, and they
 say that when, after the discovery of vril, they remodelled their
 political institutions, they expressly adopted a title taken from an
 extinct race and a dead language for that of their chief magistrate, in
 order to avoid all titles for that office with which they had previous
 associations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Should life be spared to me, I may collect into systematic form such
 knowledge as I acquired of this language during my sojourn amongst the
 Vril-ya. But what I have already said will perhaps suffice to show to
 genuine philological students that a language which, preserving so many of
 the roots in the aboriginal form, and clearing from the immediate, but
 transitory, polysynthetical stage so many rude incumbrances, has attained
 to such a union of simplicity and compass in its final inflectional forms,
 must have been the gradual work of countless ages and many varieties of
 mind ; that it contains the evidence of fusion between congenial races,
 and necessitated, in arriving at the shape of which I have given examples,
 the continuous culture of a highly thoughtful people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That, nevertheless, the literature which belongs to this language is a
 literature of the past; that the present felicitous state of society at
 which the Ana have attained forbids the progressive cultivation of
 literature, especially in the two main divisions of fiction and history,
 ?I shall have occasion to show.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 This people have a religion, and, whatever may be said against it, at
 least it has these strange peculiarities: firstly, that all believe in the
 creed they profess; secondly, that they all practice the precepts which
 the creed inculcates. They unite in the worship of one divine Creator and
 Sustainer of the universe. They believe that it is one of the properties
 of the all-permeating agency of vril, to transmit to the well-spring of
 life and intelligence every thought that a living creature can conceive;
 and though they do not contend that the idea of a Diety is innate, yet
 they say that the An (man) is the only creature, so far as their
 observation of nature extends, to whom 'the capacity of conceiving that
 idea,' with all the trains of thought which open out from it, is
 vouchsafed. They hold that this capacity is a privilege that cannot have
 been given in vain, and hence that prayer and thanksgiving are acceptable
 to the divine Creator, and necessary to the complete development of the
 human creature. They offer their devotions both in private and public. Not
 being considered one of their species, I was not admitted into the
 building or temple in which the public worship is rendered; but I am
 informed that the service is exceedingly short, and unattended with any
 pomp of ceremony. It is a doctrine with the Vril-ya, that earnest devotion
 or complete abstraction from the actual world cannot, with benefit to
 itself, be maintained long at a stretch by the human mind, especially in
 public, and that all attempts to do so either lead to fanaticism or to
 hypocrisy. When they pray in private, it is when they are alone or with
 their young children.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They say that in ancient times there was a great number of books written
 upon speculations as to the nature of the Diety, and upon the forms of
 belief or worship supposed to be most agreeable to Him. But these were
 found to lead to such heated and angry disputations as not only to shake
 the peace of the community and divide families before the most united, but
 in the course of discussing the attributes of the Diety, the existence of
 the Diety Himself became argued away, or, what was worse, became invested
 with the passions and infirmities of the human disputants. "For," said my
 host, "since a finite being like an An cannot possibly define the
 Infinite, so, when he endeavours to realise an idea of the Divinity, he
 only reduces the Divinity into an An like himself." During the later ages,
 therefore, all theological speculations, though not forbidden, have been
 so discouraged as to have fallen utterly into disuse. The Vril-ya unite in
 a conviction of a future state, more felicitous and more perfect than the
 present. If they have very vague notions of the doctrine of rewards and
 punishments, it is perhaps because they have no systems of rewards and
 punishments among themselves, for there are no crimes to punish, and their
 moral standard is so even that no An among them is, upon the whole,
 considered more virtuous than another. If one excels, perhaps in one
 virtue, another equally excels in some other virtue; If one has his
 prevalent fault or infirmity, so also another has his. In fact, in their
 extraordinary mode of life. There are so few temptations to wrong, that
 they are good (according to their notions of goodness) merely because they
 live. They have some fanciful notions upon the continuance of life, when
 once bestowed, even in the vegetable world, as the reader will see in the
 next chapter.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Though, as I have said, the Vril-ya discourage all speculations on the
 nature of the Supreme Being, they appear to concur in a belief by which
 they think to solve that great problem of the existence of evil which has
 so perplexed the philosophy of the upper world. They hold that wherever He
 has once given life, with the perceptions of that life, however faint it
 be, as in a plant, the life is never destroyed; it passes into new and
 improved forms, though not in this planet (differing therein from the
 ordinary doctrine of metempsychosis), and that the living thing retains
 the sense of identity, so that it connects its past life with its future,
 and is 'conscious' of its progressive improvement in the scale of joy. For
 they say that, without this assumption, they cannot, according to the
 lights of human reason vouchsafed to them, discover the perfect justice
 which must be a constituent quality of the All-Wise and the All-Good.
 Injustice, they say, can only emanate from three causes: want of wisdom to
 perceive what is just, want of benevolence to desire, want of power to
 fulfill it; and that each of these three wants is incompatible in the
 All-Wise, the All-Good, the All-Powerful. But that, while even in this
 life, the wisdom, the benevolence, and the power of the Supreme Being are
 sufficiently apparent to compel our recognition, the justice necessarily
 resulting from those attributes, absolutely requires another life, not for
 man only, but for every living thing of the inferior orders. That, alike
 in the animal and the vegetable world, we see one individual rendered, by
 circumstances beyond its control, exceedingly wretched compared to its
 neighbours?one only exists as the prey of another?even a plant
 suffers from disease till it perishes prematurely, while the plant next to
 it rejoices in its vitality and lives out its happy life free from a pang.
 That it is an erroneous analogy from human infirmities to reply by saying
 that the Supreme Being only acts by general laws, thereby making his own
 secondary causes so potent as to mar the essential kindness of the First
 Cause; and a still meaner and more ignorant conception of the All-Good, to
 dismiss with a brief contempt all consideration of justice for the myriad
 forms into which He has infused life, and assume that justice is only due
 to the single product of the An. There is no small and no great in the
 eyes of the divine Life-Giver. But once grant that nothing, however
 humble, which feels that it lives and suffers, can perish through the
 series of ages, that all its suffering here, if continuous from the moment
 of its birth to that of its transfer to another form of being, would be
 more brief compared with eternity than the cry of the new-born is compared
 to the whole life of a man; and once suppose that this living thing
 retains its sense of identity when so transformed (for without that sense
 it could be aware of no future being), and though, indeed, the fulfilment
 of divine justice is removed from the scope of our ken, yet we have a
 right to assume it to be uniform and universal, and not varying and
 partial, as it would be if acting only upon general and secondary laws;
 because such perfect justice flows of necessity from perfectness of
 knowledge to conceive, perfectness of love to will, and perfectness of
 power to complete it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However fantastic this belief of the Vril-ya may be, it tends perhaps to
 confirm politically the systems of government which, admitting different
 degrees of wealth, yet establishes perfect equality in rank, exquisite
 mildness in all relations and intercourse, and tenderness to all created
 things which the good of the community does not require them to destroy.
 And though their notion of compensation to a tortured insect or a cankered
 flower may seem to some of us a very wild crotchet, yet, at least, is not
 a mischievous one; and it may furnish matter for no unpleasing reflection
 to think that within the abysses of earth, never lit by a ray from the
 material heavens, there should have penetrated so luminous a conviction of
 the ineffable goodness of the Creator?so fixed an idea that the
 general laws by which He acts cannot admit of any partial injustice or
 evil, and therefore cannot be comprehended without reference to their
 action over all space and throughout all time. And since, as I shall have
 occasion to observe later, the intellectual conditions and social systems
 of this subterranean race comprise and harmonise great, and apparently
 antagonistic, varieties in philosophical doctrine and speculation which
 have from time to time been started, discussed, dismissed, and have
 re-appeared amongst thinkers or dreamers in the upper world,?so I
 may perhaps appropriately conclude this reference to the belief of the
 Vril-ya, that self-conscious or sentient life once given is indestructible
 among inferior creatures as well as in man, by an eloquent passage from
 the work of that eminent zoologist, Louis Agassiz, which I have only just
 met with, many years after I had committed to paper these recollections of
 the life of the Vril-ya which I now reduce into something like arrangement
 and form: "The relations which individual animals bear to one another are
 of such a character that they ought long ago to have been considered as
 sufficient proof that no organised being could ever have been called into
 existence by other agency than by the direct intervention of a reflective
 mind. This argues strongly in favour of the existence in every animal of
 an immaterial principle similar to that which by its excellence and
 superior endowments places man so much above the animals; yet the
 principle unquestionably exists, and whether it be called sense, reason,
 or instinct, it presents in the whole range of organised beings a series
 of phenomena closely linked together, and upon it are based not only the
 higher manifestations of the mind, but the very permanence of the specific
 differences which characterise every organism. Most of the arguments in
 favour of the immortality of man apply equally to the permanency of this
 principle in other living beings. May I not add that a future life in
 which man would be deprived of that great source of enjoyment and
 intellectual and moral improvement which results from the contemplation of
 the harmonies of an organic world would involve a lamentable loss? And may
 we not look to a spiritual concert of the combined worlds and ALL their
 inhabitants in the presence of their Creator as the highest conception of
 paradise?"?'Essay on Classification,' sect. xvii. p. 97-99.

 <h2>
 Chapter XV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Kind to me as I found all in this household, the young daughter of my host
 was the most considerate and thoughtful in her kindness. At her suggestion
 I laid aside the habiliments in which I had descended from the upper
 earth, and adopted the dress of the Vril-ya, with the exception of the
 artful wings which served them, when on foot, as a graceful mantle. But as
 many of the Vril-ya, when occupied in urban pursuits, did not wear these
 wings, this exception created no marked difference between myself and the
 race among whom I sojourned, and I was thus enabled to visit the town
 without exciting unpleasant curiosity. Out of the household no one
 suspected that I had come from the upper world, and I was but regarded as
 one of some inferior and barbarous tribe whom Aph-Lin entertained as a
 guest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The city was large in proportion to the territory round it, which was of
 no greater extent than many an English or Hungarian nobleman's estate; but
 the whole if it, to the verge of the rocks which constituted its boundary,
 was cultivated to the nicest degree, except where certain allotments of
 mountain and pasture were humanely left free to the sustenance of the
 harmless animals they had tamed, though not for domestic use. So great is
 their kindness towards these humbler creatures, that a sum is devoted from
 the public treasury for the purpose of deporting them to other Vril-ya
 communities willing to receive them (chiefly new colonies), whenever they
 become too numerous for the pastures allotted to them in their native
 place. They do not, however, multiply to an extent comparable to the ratio
 at which, with us, animals bred for slaughter, increase. It seems a law of
 nature that animals not useful to man gradually recede from the domains he
 occupies, or even become extinct. It is an old custom of the various
 sovereign states amidst which the race of the Vril-ya are distributed, to
 leave between each state a neutral and uncultivated border-land. In the
 instance of the community I speak of, this tract, being a ridge of savage
 rocks, was impassable by foot, but was easily surmounted, whether by the
 wings of the inhabitants or the air-boats, of which I shall speak
 hereafter. Roads through it were also cut for the transit of vehicles
 impelled by vril. These intercommunicating tracts were always kept
 lighted, and the expense thereof defrayed by a special tax, to which all
 the communities comprehended in the denomination of Vril-ya contribute in
 settled proportions. By these means a considerable commercial traffic with
 other states, both near and distant, was carried on. The surplus wealth on
 this special community was chiefly agricultural. The community was also
 eminent for skill in constructing implements connected with the arts of
 husbandry. In exchange for such merchandise it obtained articles more of
 luxury than necessity. There were few things imported on which they set a
 higher price than birds taught to pipe artful tunes in concert. These were
 brought from a great distance, and were marvellous for beauty of song and
 plumage. I understand that extraordinary care was taken by their breeders
 and teachers in selection, and that the species had wonderfully improved
 during the last few years. I saw no other pet animals among this community
 except some very amusing and sportive creatures of the Batrachian species,
 resembling frogs, but with very intelligent countenances, which the
 children were fond of, and kept in their private gardens. They appear to
 have no animals akin to our dogs or horses, though that learned
 naturalist, Zee, informed me that such creatures had once existed in those
 parts, and might now be found in regions inhabited by other races than the
 Vril-ya. She said that they had gradually disappeared from the more
 civilised world since the discovery of vril, and the results attending
 that discovery had dispensed with their uses. Machinery and the invention
 of wings had superseded the horse as a beast of burden; and the dog was no
 longer wanted either for protection or the chase, as it had been when the
 ancestors of the Vril-ya feared the aggressions of their own kind, or
 hunted the lesser animals for food. Indeed, however, so far as the horse
 was concerned, this region was so rocky that a horse could have been,
 there, of little use either for pastime or burden. The only creature they
 use for the latter purpose is a kind of large goat which is much employed
 on farms. The nature of the surrounding soil in these districts may be
 said to have first suggested the invention of wings and air-boats. The
 largeness of space in proportion to the space occupied by the city, was
 occasioned by the custom of surrounding every house with a separate
 garden. The broad main street, in which Aph-Lin dwelt, expanded into a
 vast square, in which were placed the College of Sages and all the public
 offices; a magnificent fountain of the luminous fluid which I call naptha
 (I am ignorant of its real nature) in the centre. All these public
 edifices have a uniform character of massiveness and solidity. They
 reminded me of the architectural pictures of Martin. Along the upper
 stories of each ran a balcony, or rather a terraced garden, supported by
 columns, filled with flowering plants, and tenanted by many kinds of tame
 birds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the square branched several streets, all broad and brilliantly
 lighted, and ascending up the eminence on either side. In my excursions in
 the town I was never allowed to go alone; Aph-Lin or his daughter was my
 habitual companion. In this community the adult Gy is seen walking with
 any young An as familiarly as if there were no difference of sex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The retail shops are not very numerous; the persons who attend on a
 customer are all children of various ages, and exceedingly intelligent and
 courteous, but without the least touch of importunity or cringing. The
 shopkeeper himself might or might not be visible; when visible, he seemed
 rarely employed on any matter connected with his professional business;
 and yet he had taken to that business from special liking for it, and
 quite independently of his general sources of fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Ana of the community are, on the whole, an indolent set of beings
 after the active age of childhood. Whether by temperament or philosophy,
 they rank repose among the chief blessings of life. Indeed, when you take
 away from a human being the incentives to action which are found in
 cupidity or ambition, it seems to me no wonder that he rests quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In their ordinary movements they prefer the use of their feet to that of
 their wings. But for their sports or (to indulge in a bold misuse of
 terms) their public 'promenades,' they employ the latter, also for the
 aerial dances I have described, as well as for visiting their country
 places, which are mostly placed on lofty heights; and, when still young,
 they prefer their wings for travel into the other regions of the Ana, to
 vehicular conveyances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those who accustom themselves to flight can fly, if less rapidly than some
 birds, yet from twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, and keep up that rate
 for five or six hours at a stretch. But the Ana generally, on reaching
 middle age, are not fond of rapid movements requiring violent exercise.
 Perhaps for this reason, as they hold a doctrine which our own physicians
 will doubtless approve?viz., that regular transpiration through the
 pores of the skin is essential to health, they habitually use the
 sweating-baths to which we give the name Turkish or Roman, succeeded by
 douches of perfumed waters. They have great faith in the salubrious virtue
 of certain perfumes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is their custom also, at stated but rare periods, perhaps four times
 a-year when in health, to use a bath charged with vril.*
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * I once tried the effect of the vril bath. It was very similar in its
 invigorating powers to that of the baths at Gastein, the virtues of which
 are ascribed by many physicians to electricity; but though similar, the
 effect of the vril bath was more lasting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They consider that this fluid, sparingly used, is a great sustainer of
 life; but used in excess, when in the normal state of health, rather tends
 to reaction and exhausted vitality. For nearly all their diseases,
 however, they resort to it as the chief assistant to nature in throwing
 off their complaint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In their own way they are the most luxurious of people, but all their
 luxuries are innocent. They may be said to dwell in an atmosphere of music
 and fragrance. Every room has its mechanical contrivances for melodious
 sounds, usually tuned down to soft-murmured notes, which seem like sweet
 whispers from invisible spirits. They are too accustomed to these gentle
 sounds to find them a hindrance to conversation, nor, when alone, to
 reflection. But they have a notion that to breathe an air filled with
 continuous melody and perfume has necessarily an effect at once soothing
 and elevating upon the formation of character and the habits of thought.
 Though so temperate, and with total abstinence from other animal food than
 milk, and from all intoxicating drinks, they are delicate and dainty to an
 extreme in food and beverage; and in all their sports even the old exhibit
 a childlike gaiety. Happiness is the end at which they aim, not as the
 excitement of a moment, but as the prevailing condition of the entire
 existence; and regard for the happiness of each other is evinced by the
 exquisite amenity of their manners.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their conformation of skull has marked differences from that of any known
 races in the upper world, though I cannot help thinking it a development,
 in the course of countless ages of the Brachycephalic type of the Age of
 Stone in Lyell's 'Elements of Geology,' C. X., p. 113, as compared with
 the Dolichocephalic type of the beginning of the Age of Iron,
 correspondent with that now so prevalent amongst us, and called the Celtic
 type. It has the same comparative massiveness of forehead, not receding
 like the Celtic?the same even roundness in the frontal organs; but
 it is far loftier in the apex, and far less pronounced in the hinder
 cranial hemisphere where phrenologists place the animal organs. To speak
 as a phrenologist, the cranium common to the Vril-ya has the organs of
 weight, number, tune, form, order, causality, very largely developed; that
 of construction much more pronounced than that of ideality. Those which
 are called the moral organs, such as conscientiousness and benevolence,
 are amazingly full; amativeness and combativeness are both small;
 adhesiveness large; the organ of destructiveness (i.e., of determined
 clearance of intervening obstacles) immense, but less than that of
 benevolence; and their philoprogenitiveness takes rather the character of
 compassion and tenderness to things that need aid or protection than of
 the animal love of offspring. I never met with one person deformed or
 misshapen. The beauty of their countenances is not only in symmetry of
 feature, but in a smoothness of surface, which continues without line or
 wrinkle to the extreme of old age, and a serene sweetness of expression,
 combined with that majesty which seems to come from consciousness of power
 and the freedom of all terror, physical or moral. It is that very
 sweetness, combined with that majesty, which inspired in a beholder like
 myself, accustomed to strive with the passions of mankind, a sentiment of
 humiliation, of awe, of dread. It is such an expression as a painter might
 give to a demi-god, a genius, an angel. The males of the Vril-ya are
 entirely beardless; the Gy-ei sometimes, in old age, develop a small
 moustache.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was surprised to find that the colour of their skin was not uniformly
 that which I had remarked in those individuals whom I had first
 encountered,?some being much fairer, and even with blue eyes, and
 hair of a deep golden auburn, though still of complexions warmer or richer
 in tone than persons in the north of Europe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was told that this admixture of colouring arose from intermarriage with
 other and more distant tribes of the Vril-ya, who, whether by the accident
 of climate or early distinction of race, were of fairer hues than the
 tribes of which this community formed one. It was considered that the
 dark-red skin showed the most ancient family of Ana; but they attached no
 sentiment of pride to that antiquity, and, on the contrary, believed their
 present excellence of breed came from frequent crossing with other
 families differing, yet akin; and they encourage such intermarriages,
 always provided that it be with the Vril-ya nations. Nations which, not
 conforming their manners and institutions to those of the Vril-ya, nor
 indeed held capable of acquiring the powers over the vril agencies which
 it had taken them generations to attain and transmit, were regarded with
 more disdain than the citizens of New York regard the negroes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I learned from Zee, who had more lore in all matters than any male with
 whom I was brought into familiar converse, that the superiority of the
 Vril-ya was supposed to have originated in the intensity of their earlier
 struggles against obstacles in nature amidst the localities in which they
 had first settled. "Wherever," said Zee, moralising, "wherever goes on
 that early process in the history of civilisation, by which life is made a
 struggle, in which the individual has to put forth all his powers to
 compete with his fellow, we invariably find this result?viz., since
 in the competition a vast number must perish, nature selects for
 preservation only the strongest specimens. With our race, therefore, even
 before the discovery of vril, only the highest organisations were
 preserved; and there is among our ancient books a legend, once popularly
 believed, that we were driven from a region that seems to denote the world
 you come from, in order to perfect our condition and attain to the purest
 elimination of our species by the severity of the struggles our
 forefathers underwent; and that, when our education shall become finally
 completed, we are destined to return to the upper world, and supplant all
 the inferior races now existing therein."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aph-Lin and Zee often conversed with me in private upon the political and
 social conditions of that upper world, in which Zee so philosophically
 assumed that the inhabitants were to be exterminated one day or other by
 the advent of the Vril-ya. They found in my accounts,?in which I
 continued to do all I could (without launching into falsehoods so positive
 that they would have been easily detected by the shrewdness of my
 listeners) to present our powers and ourselves in the most flattering
 point of view,?perpetual subjects of comparison between our most
 civilised populations and the meaner subterranean races which they
 considered hopelessly plunged in barbarism, and doomed to gradual if
 certain extinction. But they both agreed in desiring to conceal from their
 community all premature opening into the regions lighted by the sun; both
 were humane, and shrunk from the thought of annihilating so many millions
 of creatures; and the pictures I drew of our life, highly coloured as they
 were, saddened them. In vain I boasted of our great men?poets,
 philosophers, orators, generals?and defied the Vril-ya to produce
 their equals. "Alas," said Zee, "this predominance of the few over the
 many is the surest and most fatal sign of a race incorrigibly savage. See
 you not that the primary condition of mortal happiness consists in the
 extinction of that strife and competition between individuals, which, no
 matter what forms of government they adopt, render the many subordinate to
 the few, destroy real liberty to the individual, whatever may be the
 nominal liberty of the state, and annul that calm of existence, without
 which, felicity, mental or bodily, cannot be attained? Our notion is, that
 the more we can assimilate life to the existence which our noblest ideas
 can conceive to be that of spirits on the other side of the grave, why,
 the more we approximate to a divine happiness here, and the more easily we
 glide into the conditions of being hereafter. For, surely, all we can
 imagine of the life of gods, or of blessed immortals, supposes the absence
 of self-made cares and contentious passions, such as avarice and ambition.
 It seems to us that it must be a life of serene tranquility, not indeed
 without active occupations to the intellectual or spiritual powers, but
 occupations, of whatsoever nature they be, congenial to the idiosyncrasies
 of each, not forced and repugnant?a life gladdened by the
 untrammelled interchange of gentle affections, in which the moral
 atmosphere utterly kills hate and vengeance, and strife and rivalry. Such
 is the political state to which all the tribes and families of the Vril-ya
 seek to attain, and towards that goal all our theories of government are
 shaped. You see how utterly opposed is such a progress to that of the
 uncivilised nations from which you come, and which aim at a systematic
 perpetuity of troubles, and cares, and warring passions aggravated more
 and more as their progress storms its way onward. The most powerful of all
 the races in our world, beyond the pale of the Vril-ya, esteems itself the
 best governed of all political societies, and to have reached in that
 respect the extreme end at which political wisdom can arrive, so that the
 other nations should tend more or less to copy it. It has established, on
 its broadest base, the Koom-Posh?viz., the government of the
 ignorant upon the principle of being the most numerous. It has placed the
 supreme bliss in the vying with each other in all things, so that the evil
 passions are never in repose?vying for power, for wealth, for
 eminence of some kind; and in this rivalry it is horrible to hear the
 vituperation, the slanders, and calumnies which even the best and mildest
 among them heap on each other without remorse or shame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some years ago," said Aph-Lin, "I visited this people, and their misery
 and degradation were the more appalling because they were always boasting
 of their felicity and grandeur as compared with the rest of their species.
 And there is no hope that this people, which evidently resembles your own,
 can improve, because all their notions tend to further deterioration. They
 desire to enlarge their dominion more and more, in direct antagonism to
 the truth that, beyond a very limited range, it is impossible to secure to
 a community the happiness which belongs to a well-ordered family; and the
 more they mature a system by which a few individuals are heated and
 swollen to a size above the standard slenderness of the millions, the more
 they chuckle and exact, and cry out, 'See by what great exceptions to the
 common littleness of our race we prove the magnificent results of our
 system!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fact," resumed Zee, "if the wisdom of human life be to approximate to
 the serene equality of immortals, there can be no more direct flying off
 into the opposite direction than a system which aims at carrying to the
 utmost the inequalities and turbulences of mortals. Nor do I see how, by
 any forms of religious belief, mortals, so acting, could fit themselves
 even to appreciate the joys of immortals to which they still expect to be
 transferred by the mere act of dying. On the contrary, minds accustomed to
 place happiness in things so much the reverse of godlike, would find the
 happiness of gods exceedingly dull, and would long to get back to a world
 in which they could quarrel with each other."

 <h2>
 Chapter XVI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I have spoken so much of the Vril Staff that my reader may expect me to
 describe it. This I cannot do accurately, for I was never allowed to
 handle it for fear of some terrible accident occasioned by my ignorance of
 its use; and I have no doubt that it requires much skill and practice in
 the exercise of its various powers. It is hollow, and has in the handle
 several stops, keys, or springs by which its force can be altered,
 modified, or directed?so that by one process it destroys, by another
 it heals?by one it can rend the rock, by another disperse the vapour?by
 one it affects bodies, by another it can exercise a certain influence over
 minds. It is usually carried in the convenient size of a walking-staff,
 but it has slides by which it can be lengthened or shortened at will. When
 used for special purposes, the upper part rests in the hollow of the palm
 with the fore and middle fingers protruded. I was assured, however, that
 its power was not equal in all, but proportioned to the amount of certain
 vril properties in the wearer in affinity, or 'rapport' with the purposes
 to be effected. Some were more potent to destroy, others to heal, &amp;c.;
 much also depended on the calm and steadiness of volition in the
 manipulator. They assert that the full exercise of vril power can only be
 acquired by the constitutional temperament?i.e., by hereditarily
 transmitted organisation?and that a female infant of four years old
 belonging to the Vril-ya races can accomplish feats which a life spent in
 its practice would not enable the strongest and most skilled mechanician,
 born out of the pale of the Vril-ya to achieve. All these wands are not
 equally complicated; those intrusted to children are much simpler than
 those borne by sages of either sex, and constructed with a view to the
 special object on which the children are employed; which as I have before
 said, is among the youngest children the most destructive. In the wands of
 wives and mothers the correlative destroying force is usually abstracted,
 the healing power fully charged. I wish I could say more in detail of this
 singular conductor of the vril fluid, but its machinery is as exquisite as
 its effects are marvellous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I should say, however, that this people have invented certain tubes by
 which the vril fluid can be conducted towards the object it is meant to
 destroy, throughout a distance almost indefinite; at least I put it
 modestly when I say from 500 to 1000 miles. And their mathematical science
 as applied to such purpose is so nicely accurate, that on the report of
 some observer in an air-boat, any member of the vril department can
 estimate unerringly the nature of intervening obstacles, the height to
 which the projectile instrument should be raised, and the extent to which
 it should be charged, so as to reduce to ashes within a space of time too
 short for me to venture to specify it, a capital twice as vast as London.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Certainly these Ana are wonderful mathematicians?wonderful for the
 adaptation of the inventive faculty to practical uses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went with my host and his daughter Zee over the great public museum,
 which occupies a wing in the College of Sages, and in which are hoarded,
 as curious specimens of the ignorant and blundering experiments of ancient
 times, many contrivances on which we pride ourselves as recent
 achievements. In one department, carelessly thrown aside as obsolete
 lumber, are tubes for destroying life by metallic balls and an inflammable
 powder, on the principle of our cannons and catapults, and even still more
 murderous than our latest improvements.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host spoke of these with a smile of contempt, such as an artillery
 officer might bestow on the bows and arrows of the Chinese. In another
 department there were models of vehicles and vessels worked by steam, and
 of an air-balloon which might have been constructed by Montgolfier.
 "Such," said Zee, with an air of meditative wisdom?"such were the
 feeble triflings with nature of our savage forefathers, ere they had even
 a glimmering perception of the properties of vril!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This young Gy was a magnificent specimen of the muscular force to which
 the females of her country attain. Her features were beautiful, like those
 of all her race: never in the upper world have I seen a face so grand and
 so faultless, but her devotion to the severer studies had given to her
 countenance an expression of abstract thought which rendered it somewhat
 stern when in repose; and such a sternness became formidable when observed
 in connection with her ample shoulders and lofty stature. She was tall
 even for a Gy, and I saw her lift up a cannon as easily as I could lift a
 pocket-pistol. Zee inspired me with a profound terror?a terror which
 increased when we came into a department of the museum appropriated to
 models of contrivances worked by the agency of vril; for here, merely by a
 certain play of her vril staff, she herself standing at a distance, she
 put into movement large and weighty substances. She seemed to endow them
 with intelligence, and to make them comprehend and obey her command. She
 set complicated pieces of machinery into movement, arrested the movement
 or continued it, until, within an incredibly short time, various kinds of
 raw material were reproduced as symmetrical works of art, complete and
 perfect. Whatever effect mesmerism or electro-biology produces over the
 nerves and muscles of animated objects, this young Gy produced by the
 motions of her slender rod over the springs and wheels of lifeless
 mechanism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I mentioned to my companions my astonishment at this influence over
 inanimate matter?while owning that, in our world, I had witnessed
 phenomena which showed that over certain living organisations certain
 other living organisations could establish an influence genuine in itself,
 but often exaggerated by credulity or craft?Zee, who was more
 interested in such subjects than her father, bade me stretch forth my
 hand, and then, placing it beside her own, she called my attention to
 certain distinctions of type and character. In the first place, the thumb
 of the Gy (and, as I afterwards noticed, of all that race, male or female)
 was much larger, at once longer and more massive, than is found with our
 species above ground. There is almost, in this, as great a difference as
 there is between the thumb of a man and that of a gorilla. Secondly, the
 palm is proportionally thicker than ours?the texture of the skin
 infinitely finer and softer?its average warmth is greater. More
 remarkable than all this, is a visible nerve, perceptible under the skin,
 which starts from the wrist skirting the ball of the thumb, and branching,
 fork-like, at the roots of the fore and middle fingers. "With your slight
 formation of thumb," said the philosophical young Gy, "and with the
 absence of the nerve which you find more or less developed in the hands of
 our race, you can never achieve other than imperfect and feeble power over
 the agency of vril; but so far as the nerve is concerned, that is not
 found in the hands of our earliest progenitors, nor in those of the ruder
 tribes without the pale of the Vril-ya. It has been slowly developed in
 the course of generations, commencing in the early achievements, and
 increasing with the continuous exercise, of the vril power; therefore, in
 the course of one or two thousand years, such a nerve may possibly be
 engendered in those higher beings of your race, who devote themselves to
 that paramount science through which is attained command over all the
 subtler forces of nature permeated by vril. But when you talk of matter as
 something in itself inert and motionless, your parents or tutors surely
 cannot have left you so ignorant as not to know that no form of matter is
 motionless and inert: every particle is constantly in motion and
 constantly acted upon by agencies, of which heat is the most apparent and
 rapid, but vril the most subtle, and, when skilfully wielded, the most
 powerful. So that, in fact, the current launched by my hand and guided by
 my will does but render quicker and more potent the action which is
 eternally at work upon every particle of matter, however inert and
 stubborn it may seem. If a heap of metal be not capable of originating a
 thought of its own, yet, through its internal susceptibility to movement,
 it obtains the power to receive the thought of the intellectual agent at
 work on it; by which, when conveyed with a sufficient force of the vril
 power, it is as much compelled to obey as if it were displaced by a
 visible bodily force. It is animated for the time being by the soul thus
 infused into it, so that one may almost say that it lives and reasons.
 Without this we could not make our automata supply the place of servants."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was too much in awe of the thews and the learning of the young Gy to
 hazard the risk of arguing with her. I had read somewhere in my schoolboy
 days that a wise man, disputing with a Roman Emperor, suddenly drew in his
 horns; and when the emperor asked him whether he had nothing further to
 say on his side of the question, replied, "Nay, Caesar, there is no
 arguing against a reasoner who commands ten legions."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Though I had a secret persuasion that, whatever the real effects of vril
 upon matter, Mr. Faraday could have proved her a very shallow philosopher
 as to its extent or its causes, I had no doubt that Zee could have brained
 all the Fellows of the Royal Society, one after the other, with a blow of
 her fist. Every sensible man knows that it is useless to argue with any
 ordinary female upon matters he comprehends; but to argue with a Gy seven
 feet high upon the mysteries of vril,?as well argue in a desert, and
 with a simoon!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amid the various departments to which the vast building of the College of
 Sages was appropriated, that which interested me most was devoted to the
 archaeology of the Vril-ya, and comprised a very ancient collection of
 portraits. In these the pigments and groundwork employed were of so
 durable a nature that even pictures said to be executed at dates as remote
 as those in the earliest annals of the Chinese, retained much freshness of
 colour. In examining this collection, two things especially struck me:?first,
 that the pictures said to be between 6000 and 7000 years old were of a
 much higher degree of art than any produced within the last 3000 or 4000
 years; and, second, that the portraits within the former period much more
 resembled our own upper world and European types of countenance. Some of
 them, indeed reminded me of the Italian heads which look out from the
 canvases of Titian?speaking of ambition or craft, of care or of
 grief, with furrows in which the passions have passed with iron
 ploughshare. These were the countenances of men who had lived in struggle
 and conflict before the discovery of the latent forces of vril had changed
 the character of society?men who had fought with each other for
 power or fame as we in the upper world fight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The type of face began to evince a marked change about a thousand years
 after the vril revolution, becoming then, with each generation, more
 serene, and in that serenity more terribly distinct from the faces of
 labouring and sinful men; while in proportion as the beauty and the
 grandeur of the countenance itself became more fully developed, the art of
 the painter became more tame and monotonous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the greatest curiosity in the collection was that of three portraits
 belonging to the pre-historical age, and, according to mythical tradition,
 taken by the orders of a philosopher, whose origin and attributes were as
 much mixed up with symbolical fable as those of an Indian Budh or a Greek
 Prometheus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From this mysterious personage, at once a sage and a hero, all the
 principal sections of the Vril-ya race pretend to trace a common origin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The portraits are of the philosopher himself, of his grandfather, and
 great-grandfather. They are all at full length. The philosopher is attired
 in a long tunic which seems to form a loose suit of scaly armour,
 borrowed, perhaps, from some fish or reptile, but the feet and hands are
 exposed: the digits in both are wonderfully long, and webbed. He has
 little or no perceptible throat, and a low receding forehead, not at all
 the ideal of a sage's. He has bright brown prominent eyes, a very wide
 mouth and high cheekbones, and a muddy complexion. According to tradition,
 this philosopher had lived to a patriarchal age, extending over many
 centuries, and he remembered distinctly in middle life his grandfather as
 surviving, and in childhood his great-grandfather; the portrait of the
 first he had taken, or caused to be taken, while yet alive?that of
 the latter was taken from his effigies in mummy. The portrait of his
 grandfather had the features and aspect of the philosopher, only much more
 exaggerated: he was not dressed, and the colour of his body was singular;
 the breast and stomach yellow, the shoulders and legs of a dull bronze
 hue: the great-grandfather was a magnificent specimen of the Batrachian
 genus, a Giant Frog, 'pur et simple.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Among the pithy sayings which, according to tradition, the philosopher
 bequeathed to posterity in rhythmical form and sententious brevity, this
 is notably recorded: "Humble yourselves, my descendants; the father of
 your race was a 'twat' (tadpole): exalt yourselves, my descendants, for it
 was the same Divine Thought which created your father that develops itself
 in exalting you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aph-Lin told me this fable while I gazed on the three Batrachian
 portraits. I said in reply: "You make a jest of my supposed ignorance and
 credulity as an uneducated Tish, but though these horrible daubs may be of
 great antiquity, and were intended, perhaps, for some rude caracature, I
 presume that none of your race even in the less enlightened ages, ever
 believed that the great-grandson of a Frog became a sententious
 philosopher; or that any section, I will not say of the lofty Vril-ya, but
 of the meanest varieties of the human race, had its origin in a Tadpole."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me," answered Aph-Lin: "in what we call the Wrangling or
 Philosophical Period of History, which was at its height about seven
 thousand years ago, there was a very distinguished naturalist, who proved
 to the satisfaction of numerous disciples such analogical and anatomical
 agreements in structure between an An and a Frog, as to show that out of
 the one must have developed the other. They had some diseases in common;
 they were both subject to the same parasitical worms in the intestines;
 and, strange to say, the An has, in his structure, a swimming-bladder, no
 longer of any use to him, but which is a rudiment that clearly proves his
 descent from a Frog. Nor is there any argument against this theory to be
 found in the relative difference of size, for there are still existent in
 our world Frogs of a size and stature not inferior to our own, and many
 thousand years ago they appear to have been still larger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I understand that," said I, "because Frogs this enormous are, according
 to our eminent geologists, who perhaps saw them in dreams, said to have
 been distinguished inhabitants of the upper world before the Deluge; and
 such Frogs are exactly the creatures likely to have flourished in the
 lakes and morasses of your subterranean regions. But pray, proceed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the Wrangling Period of History, whatever one sage asserted another
 sage was sure to contradict. In fact, it was a maxim in that age, that the
 human reason could only be sustained aloft by being tossed to and fro in
 the perpetual motion of contradiction; and therefore another sect of
 philosophers maintained the doctrine that the An was not the descendant of
 the Frog, but that the Frog was clearly the improved development of the
 An. The shape of the Frog, taken generally, was much more symmetrical than
 that of the An; beside the beautiful conformation of its lower limbs, its
 flanks and shoulders the majority of the Ana in that day were almost
 deformed, and certainly ill-shaped. Again, the Frog had the power to live
 alike on land and in water?a mighty privilege, partaking of a
 spiritual essence denied to the An, since the disuse of his
 swimming-bladder clearly proves his degeneration from a higher development
 of species. Again, the earlier races of the Ana seem to have been covered
 with hair, and, even to a comparatively recent date, hirsute bushes
 deformed the very faces of our ancestors, spreading wild over their cheeks
 and chins, as similar bushes, my poor Tish, spread wild over yours. But
 the object of the higher races of the Ana through countless generations
 has been to erase all vestige of connection with hairy vertebrata, and
 they have gradually eliminated that debasing capillary excrement by the
 law of sexual selection; the Gy-ei naturally preferring youth or the
 beauty of smooth faces. But the degree of the Frog in the scale of the
 vertebrata is shown in this, that he has no hair at all, not even on his
 head. He was born to that hairless perfection which the most beautiful of
 the Ana, despite the culture of incalculable ages, have not yet attained.
 The wonderful complication and delicacy of a Frog's nervous system and
 arterial circulation were shown by this school to be more susceptible of
 enjoyment than our inferior, or at least simpler, physical frame allows us
 to be. The examination of a Frog's hand, if I may use that expression,
 accounted for its keener susceptibility to love, and to social life in
 general. In fact, gregarious and amatory as are the Ana, Frogs are still
 more so. In short, these two schools raged against each other; one
 asserting the An to be the perfected type of the Frog; the other that the
 Frog was the highest development of the An. The moralists were divided in
 opinion with the naturalists, but the bulk of them sided with the
 Frog-preference school. They said, with much plausibility, that in moral
 conduct (viz., in the adherence to rules best adapted to the health and
 welfare of the individual and the community) there could be no doubt of
 the vast superiority of the Frog. All history showed the wholesale
 immorality of the human race, the complete disregard, even by the most
 renowned amongst them, of the laws which they acknowledged to be essential
 to their own and the general happiness and wellbeing. But the severest
 critic of the Frog race could not detect in their manners a single
 aberration from the moral law tacitly recognised by themselves. And what,
 after all, can be the profit of civilisation if superiority in moral
 conduct be not the aim for which it strives, and the test by which its
 progress should be judged?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fine, the adherents of this theory presumed that in some remote period
 the Frog race had been the improved development of the Human; but that,
 from some causes which defied rational conjecture, they had not maintained
 their original position in the scale of nature; while the Ana, though of
 inferior organisation, had, by dint less of their virtues than their
 vices, such as ferocity and cunning, gradually acquired ascendancy, much
 as among the human race itself tribes utterly barbarous have, by
 superiority in similar vices, utterly destroyed or reduced into
 insignificance tribes originally excelling them in mental gifts and
 culture. Unhappily these disputes became involved with the religious
 notions of that age; and as society was then administered under the
 government of the Koom-Posh, who, being the most ignorant, were of course
 the most inflammable class?the multitude took the whole question out
 of the hands of the philosophers; political chiefs saw that the Frog
 dispute, so taken up by the populace, could become a most valuable
 instrument of their ambition; and for not less than one thousand years war
 and massacre prevailed, during which period the philosophers on both sides
 were butchered, and the government of Koom-Posh itself was happily brought
 to an end by the ascendancy of a family that clearly established its
 descent from the aboriginal tadpole, and furnished despotic rulers to the
 various nations of the Ana. These despots finally disappeared, at least
 from our communities, as the discovery of vril led to the tranquil
 institutions under which flourish all the races of the Vril-ya."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do no wranglers or philosophers now exist to revive the dispute; or
 do they all recognise the origin of your race in the tadpole?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, such disputes," said Zee, with a lofty smile, "belong to the
 Pah-bodh of the dark ages, and now only serve for the amusement of
 infants. When we know the elements out of which our bodies are composed,
 elements in common to the humblest vegetable plants, can it signify
 whether the All-Wise combined those elements out of one form more than
 another, in order to create that in which He has placed the capacity to
 receive the idea of Himself, and all the varied grandeurs of intellect to
 which that idea gives birth? The An in reality commenced to exist as An
 with the donation of that capacity, and, with that capacity, the sense to
 acknowledge that, however through the countless ages his race may improve
 in wisdom, it can never combine the elements at its command into the form
 of a tadpole."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You speak well, Zee," said Aph-Lin; "and it is enough for us shortlived
 mortals to feel a reasonable assurance that whether the origin of the An
 was a tadpole or not, he is no more likely to become a tadpole again than
 the institutions of the Vril-ya are likely to relapse into the heaving
 quagmire and certain strife-rot of a Koom-Posh."

 <h2>
 Chapter XVII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The Vril-ya, being excluded from all sight of the heavenly bodies, and
 having no other difference between night and day than that which they deem
 it convenient to make for themselves,?do not, of course, arrive at
 their divisions of time by the same process that we do; but I found it
 easy by the aid of my watch, which I luckily had about me, to compute
 their time with great nicety. I reserve for a future work on the science
 and literature of the Vril-ya, should I live to complete it, all details
 as to the manner in which they arrive at their rotation of time; and
 content myself here with saying, that in point of duration, their year
 differs very slightly from ours, but that the divisions of their year are
 by no means the same. Their day, (including what we call night) consists
 of twenty hours of our time, instead of twenty-four, and of course their
 year comprises the correspondent increase in the number of days by which
 it is summed up. They subdivide the twenty hours of their day thus?eight
 hours,* called the "Silent Hours," for repose; eight hours, called the
 "Earnest Time," for the pursuits and occupations of life; and four hours
 called the "Easy Time" (with which what I may term their day closes),
 allotted to festivities, sport, recreation, or family converse, according
 to their several tastes and inclinations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * For the sake of convenience, I adopt the word hours, days, years, &amp;c.,
 in any general reference to subdivisions of time among the Vril-ya; those
 terms but loosely corresponding, however, with such subdivisions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, in truth, out of doors there is no night. They maintain, both in the
 streets and in the surrounding country, to the limits of their territory,
 the same degree of light at all hours. Only, within doors, they lower it
 to a soft twilight during the Silent Hours. They have a great horror of
 perfect darkness, and their lights are never wholly extinguished. On
 occasions of festivity they continue the duration of full light, but
 equally keep note of the distinction between night and day, by mechanical
 contrivances which answer the purpose of our clocks and watches. They are
 very fond of music; and it is by music that these chronometers strike the
 principal division of time. At every one of their hours, during their day,
 the sounds coming from all the time-pieces in their public buildings, and
 caught up, as it were, by those of houses or hamlets scattered amidst the
 landscapes without the city, have an effect singularly sweet, and yet
 singularly solemn. But during the Silent Hours these sounds are so subdued
 as to be only faintly heard by a waking ear. They have no change of
 seasons, and, at least on the territory of this tribe, the atmosphere
 seemed to me very equable, warm as that of an Italian summer, and humid
 rather than dry; in the forenoon usually very still, but at times invaded
 by strong blasts from the rocks that made the borders of their domain. But
 time is the same to them for sowing or reaping as in the Golden Isles of
 the ancient poets. At the same moment you see the younger plants in blade
 or bud, the older in ear or fruit. All fruit-bearing plants, however,
 after fruitage, either shed or change the colour of their leaves. But that
 which interested me most in reckoning up their divisions of time was the
 ascertainment of the average duration of life amongst them. I found on
 minute inquiry that this very considerably exceeded the term allotted to
 us on the upper earth. What seventy years are to us, one hundred years are
 to them. Nor is this the only advantage they have over us in longevity,
 for as few among us attain to the age of seventy, so, on the contrary, few
 among them die before the age of one hundred; and they enjoy a general
 degree of health and vigour which makes life itself a blessing even to the
 last. Various causes contribute to this result: the absence of all
 alcoholic stimulants; temperance in food; more especially, perhaps, a
 serenity of mind undisturbed by anxious occupations and eager passions.
 They are not tormented by our avarice or our ambition; they appear
 perfectly indifferent even to the desire of fame; they are capable of
 great affection, but their love shows itself in a tender and cheerful
 complaisance, and, while forming their happiness, seems rarely, if ever,
 to constitute their woe. As the Gy is sure only to marry where she herself
 fixes her choice, and as here, not less than above ground, it is the
 female on whom the happiness of home depends; so the Gy, having chosen the
 mate she prefers to all others, is lenient to his faults, consults his
 humours, and does her best to secure his attachment. The death of a
 beloved one is of course with them, as with us, a cause for sorrow; but
 not only is death with them so much more rare before that age in which it
 becomes a release, but when it does occur the survivor takes much more
 consolation than, I am afraid, the generality of us do, in the certainty
 of reunion in another and yet happier life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All these causes, then, concur to their healthful and enjoyable longevity,
 though, no doubt, much also must be owing to hereditary organisation.
 According to their records, however, in those earlier stages of their
 society when they lived in communities resembling ours, agitated by fierce
 competition, their lives were considerably shorter, and their maladies
 more numerous and grave. They themselves say that the duration of life,
 too, has increased, and is still on the increase, since their discovery of
 the invigorating and medicinal properties of vril, applied for remedial
 purposes. They have few professional and regular practitioners of
 medicine, and these are chiefly Gy-ei, who, especially if widowed and
 childless, find great delight in the healing art, and even undertake
 surgical operations in those cases required by accident, or, more rarely,
 by disease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They have their diversions and entertainments, and, during the Easy Time
 of their day, they are wont to assemble in great numbers for those winged
 sports in the air which I have already described. They have also public
 halls for music, and even theatres, at which are performed pieces that
 appeared to me somewhat to resemble the plays of the Chinese?dramas
 that are thrown back into distant times for their events and personages,
 in which all classic unities are outrageously violated, and the hero, in
 once scene a child, in the next is an old man, and so forth. These plays
 are of very ancient composition, and their stories cast in remote times.
 They appeared to me very dull, on the whole, but were relieved by
 startling mechanical contrivances, and a kind of farcical broad humour,
 and detached passages of great vigour and power expressed in language
 highly poetical, but somewhat overcharged with metaphor and trope. In
 fine, they seemed to me very much what the plays of Shakespeare seemed to
 a Parisian in the time of Louis XV., or perhaps to an Englishman in the
 reign of Charles II.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The audience, of which the Gy-ei constituted the chief portion, appeared
 to enjoy greatly the representation of these dramas, which, for so sedate
 and majestic a race of females, surprised me, till I observed that all the
 performers were under the age of adolescence, and conjectured truly that
 the mothers and sisters came to please their children and brothers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have said that these dramas are of great antiquity. No new plays, indeed
 no imaginative works sufficiently important to survive their immediate
 day, appear to have been composed for several generations. In fact, though
 there is no lack of new publications, and they have even what may be
 called newspapers, these are chiefly devoted to mechanical science,
 reports of new inventions, announcements respecting various details of
 business?in short, to practical matters. Sometimes a child writes a
 little tale of adventure, or a young Gy vents her amorous hopes or fears
 in a poem; but these effusions are of very little merit, and are seldom
 read except by children and maiden Gy-ei. The most interesting works of a
 purely literary character are those of explorations and travels into other
 regions of this nether world, which are generally written by young
 emigrants, and are read with great avidity by the relations and friends
 they have left behind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could not help expressing to Aph-Lin my surprise that a community in
 which mechanical science had made so marvellous a progress, and in which
 intellectual civilisation had exhibited itself in realising those objects
 for the happiness of the people, which the political philosophers above
 ground had, after ages of struggle, pretty generally agreed to consider
 unattainable visions, should, nevertheless, be so wholly without a
 contemporaneous literature, despite the excellence to which culture had
 brought a language at once so rich and simple, vigourous and musical.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host replied?"Do you not perceive that a literature such as you
 mean would be wholly incompatible with that perfection of social or
 political felicity at which you do us the honour to think we have arrived?
 We have at last, after centuries of struggle, settled into a form of
 government with which we are content, and in which, as we allow no
 differences of rank, and no honours are paid to administrators
 distinguishing them from others, there is no stimulus given to individual
 ambition. No one would read works advocating theories that involved any
 political or social change, and therefore no one writes them. If now and
 then an An feels himself dissatisfied with our tranquil mode of life, he
 does not attack it; he goes away. Thus all that part of literature (and to
 judge by the ancient books in our public libraries, it was once a very
 large part), which relates to speculative theories on society is become
 utterly extinct. Again, formerly there was a vast deal written respecting
 the attributes and essence of the All-Good, and the arguments for and
 against a future state; but now we all recognise two facts, that there IS
 a Divine Being, and there IS a future state, and we all equally agree that
 if we wrote our fingers to the bone, we could not throw any light upon the
 nature and conditions of that future state, or quicken our apprehensions
 of the attributes and essence of that Divine Being. Thus another part of
 literature has become also extinct, happily for our race; for in the time
 when so much was written on subjects which no one could determine, people
 seemed to live in a perpetual state of quarrel and contention. So, too, a
 vast part of our ancient literature consists of historical records of wars
 an revolutions during the times when the Ana lived in large and turbulent
 societies, each seeking aggrandisement at the expense of the other. You
 see our serene mode of life now; such it has been for ages. We have no
 events to chronicle. What more of us can be said than that, 'they were
 born, they were happy, they died?' Coming next to that part of literature
 which is more under the control of the imagination, such as what we call
 Glaubsila, or colloquially 'Glaubs,' and you call poetry, the reasons for
 its decline amongst us are abundantly obvious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We find, by referring to the great masterpieces in that department of
 literature which we all still read with pleasure, but of which none would
 tolerate imitations, that they consist in the portraiture of passions
 which we no longer experience?ambition, vengeance, unhallowed love,
 the thirst for warlike renown, and suchlike. The old poets lived in an
 atmosphere impregnated with these passions, and felt vividly what they
 expressed glowingly. No one can express such passions now, for no one can
 feel them, or meet with any sympathy in his readers if he did. Again, the
 old poetry has a main element in its dissection of those complex mysteries
 of human character which conduce to abnormal vices and crimes, or lead to
 signal and extraordinary virtues. But our society, having got rid of
 temptations to any prominent vices and crimes, has necessarily rendered
 the moral average so equal, that there are no very salient virtues.
 Without its ancient food of strong passions, vast crimes, heroic
 excellences, poetry therefore is, if not actually starved to death,
 reduced to a very meagre diet. There is still the poetry of description?description
 of rocks, and trees, and waters, and common household life; and our young
 Gy-ei weave much of this insipid kind of composition into their love
 verses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Such poetry," said I, "might surely be made very charming; and we have
 critics amongst us who consider it a higher kind than that which depicts
 the crimes, or analyses the passions, of man. At all events, poetry of the
 inspired kind you mention is a poetry that nowadays commands more readers
 than any other among the people I have left above ground."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Possibly; but then I suppose the writers take great pains with the
 language they employ, and devote themselves to the culture and polish of
 words and rhythms of an art?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly they do: all great poets do that. Though the gift of poetry may
 be inborn, the gift requires as much care to make it available as a block
 of metal does to be made into one of your engines."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And doubtless your poets have some incentive to bestow all those pains
 upon such verbal prettinesses?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I presume their instinct of song would make them sing as the bird
 does; but to cultivate the song into verbal or artificial prettiness,
 probably does need an inducement from without, and our poets find it in
 the love of fame?perhaps, now and then, in the want of money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Precisely so. But in our society we attach fame to nothing which man, in
 that moment of his duration which is called 'life,' can perform. We should
 soon lose that equality which constitutes the felicitous essence of our
 commonwealth if we selected any individual for pre-eminent praise:
 pre-eminent praise would confer pre-eminent power, and the moment it were
 given, evil passions, now dormant, would awake: other men would immediately
 covet praise, then would arise envy, and with envy hate, and with hate
 calumny and persecution. Our history tells us that most of the poets and
 most of the writers who, in the old time, were favoured with the greatest
 praise, were also assailed by the greatest vituperation, and even, on the
 whole, rendered very unhappy, partly by the attacks of jealous rivals,
 partly by the diseased mental constitution which an acquired sensitiveness
 to praise and to blame tends to engender. As for the stimulus of want; in
 the first place, no man in our community knows the goad of poverty; and,
 secondly, if he did, almost every occupation would be more lucrative than
 writing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Our public libraries contain all the books of the past which time has
 preserved; those books, for the reasons above stated, are infinitely
 better than any can write nowadays, and they are open to all to read
 without cost. We are not such fools as to pay for reading inferior books,
 when we can read superior books for nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With us, novelty has an attraction; and a new book, if bad, is read when
 an old book, though good, is neglected."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Novelty, to barbarous states of society struggling in despair for
 something better, has no doubt an attraction, denied to us, who see
 nothing to gain in novelties; but after all, it is observed by one of our
 great authors four thousand years ago, that 'he who studies old books will
 always find in them something new, and he who reads new books will always
 find in them something old.' But to return to the question you have
 raised, there being then amongst us no stimulus to painstaking labour,
 whether in desire of fame or in pressure of want, such as have the poetic
 temperament, no doubt vent it in song, as you say the bird sings; but for
 lack of elaborate culture it fails of an audience, and, failing of an
 audience, dies out, of itself, amidst the ordinary avocations of life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how is it that these discouragements to the cultivation of literature
 do not operate against that of science?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your question amazes me. The motive to science is the love of truth apart
 from all consideration of fame, and science with us too is devoted almost
 solely to practical uses, essential to our social conversation and the
 comforts of our daily life. No fame is asked by the inventor, and none is
 given to him; he enjoys an occupation congenial to his tastes, and needing
 no wear and tear of the passions. Man must have exercise for his mind as
 well as body; and continuous exercise, rather than violent, is best for
 both. Our most ingenious cultivators of science are, as a general rule,
 the longest lived and the most free from disease. Painting is an amusement
 to many, but the art is not what it was in former times, when the great
 painters in our various communities vied with each other for the prize of
 a golden crown, which gave them a social rank equal to that of the kings
 under whom they lived. You will thus doubtless have observed in our
 archaeological department how superior in point of art the pictures were
 several thousand years ago. Perhaps it is because music is, in reality,
 more allied to science than it is to poetry, that, of all the pleasurable
 arts, music is that which flourishes the most amongst us. Still, even in
 music the absence of stimulus in praise or fame has served to prevent any
 great superiority of one individual over another; and we rather excel in
 choral music, with the aid of our vast mechanical instruments, in which we
 make great use of the agency of water,* than in single performers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * This may remind the student of Nero's invention of a musical machine, by
 which water was made to perform the part of an orchestra, and on which he
 was employed when the conspiracy against him broke out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have had scarcely any original composer for some ages. Our favorite
 airs are very ancient in substance, but have admitted many complicated
 variations by inferior, though ingenious, musicians."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are there no political societies among the Ana which are animated by
 those passions, subjected to those crimes, and admitting those disparities
 in condition, in intellect, and in morality, which the state of your
 tribe, or indeed of the Vril-ya generally, has left behind in its progress
 to perfection? If so, among such societies perhaps Poetry and her sister
 arts still continue to be honoured and to improve?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are such societies in remote regions, but we do not admit them
 within the pale of civilised communities; we scarcely even give them the
 name of Ana, and certainly not that of Vril-ya. They are savages, living
 chiefly in that low stage of being, Koom-Posh, tending necessarily to its
 own hideous dissolution in Glek-Nas. Their wretched existence is passed in
 perpetual contest and perpetual change. When they do not fight with their
 neighbours, they fight among themselves. They are divided into sections,
 which abuse, plunder, and sometimes murder each other, and on the most
 frivolous points of difference that would be unintelligible to us if we
 had not read history, and seen that we too have passed through the same
 early state of ignorance and barbarism. Any trifle is sufficient to set
 them together by the ears. They pretend to be all equals, and the more
 they have struggled to be so, by removing old distinctions, and starting
 afresh, the more glaring and intolerable the disparity becomes, because
 nothing in hereditary affections and associations is left to soften the
 one naked distinction between the many who have nothing and the few who
 have much. Of course the many hate the few, but without the few they could
 not live. The many are always assailing the few; sometimes they
 exterminate the few; but as soon as they have done so, a new few starts
 out of the many, and is harder to deal with than the old few. For where
 societies are large, and competition to have something is the predominant
 fever, there must be always many losers and few gainers. In short, they
 are savages groping their way in the dark towards some gleam of light, and
 would demand our commiseration for their infirmities, if, like all
 savages, they did not provoke their own destruction by their arrogance and
 cruelty. Can you imagine that creatures of this kind, armed only with such
 miserable weapons as you may see in our museum of antiquities, clumsy iron
 tubes charged with saltpetre, have more than once threatened with
 destruction a tribe of the Vril-ya, which dwells nearest to them, because
 they say they have thirty millions of population?and that tribe may
 have fifty thousand?if the latter do not accept their notions of
 Soc-Sec (money getting) on some trading principles which they have the
 impudence to call 'a law of civilisation'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But thirty millions of population are formidable odds against fifty
 thousand!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My host stared at me astonished. "Stranger," said he, "you could not have
 heard me say that this threatened tribe belongs to the Vril-ya; and it
 only waits for these savages to declare war, in order to commission some
 half-a-dozen small children to sweep away their whole population."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At these words I felt a thrill of horror, recognising much more affinity
 with "the savages" than I did with the Vril-ya, and remembering all I had
 said in praise of the glorious American institutions, which Aph-Lin
 stigmatised as Koom-Posh. Recovering my self-possession, I asked if there
 were modes of transit by which I could safely visit this temerarious and
 remote people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can travel with safety, by vril agency, either along the ground or
 amid the air, throughout all the range of the communities with which we
 are allied and akin; but I cannot vouch for your safety in barbarous
 nations governed by different laws from ours; nations, indeed, so
 benighted, that there are among them large numbers who actually live by
 stealing from each other, and one could not with safety in the Silent
 Hours even leave the doors of one's own house open."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here our conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Taee, who came to
 inform us that he, having been deputed to discover and destroy the
 enormous reptile which I had seen on my first arrival, had been on the
 watch for it ever since his visit to me, and had began to suspect that my
 eyes had deceived me, or that the creature had made its way through the
 cavities within the rocks to the wild regions in which dwelt its kindred
 race,?when it gave evidences of its whereabouts by a great
 devastation of the herbage bordering one of the lakes. "And," said Taee,
 "I feel sure that within that lake it is now hiding. So," (turning to me)
 "I thought it might amuse you to accompany me to see the way we destroy
 such unpleasant visitors." As I looked at the face of the young child, and
 called to mind the enormous size of the creature he proposed to
 exterminate, I felt myself shudder with fear for him, and perhaps fear for
 myself, if I accompanied him in such a chase. But my curiosity to witness
 the destructive effects of the boasted vril, and my unwillingness to lower
 myself in the eyes of an infant by betraying apprehensions of personal
 safety, prevailed over my first impulse. Accordingly, I thanked Taee for
 his courteous consideration for my amusement, and professed my willingness
 to set out with him on so diverting an enterprise.

 <h2>
 Chapter XVIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 As Taee and myself, on quitting the town, and leaving to the left the main
 road which led to it, struck into the fields, the strange and solemn
 beauty of the landscape, lighted up, by numberless lamps, to the verge of
 the horizon, fascinated my eyes, and rendered me for some time an
 inattentive listener to the talk of my companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Along our way various operations of agriculture were being carried on by
 machinery, the forms of which were new to me, and for the most part very
 graceful; for among these people art being so cultivated for the sake of
 mere utility, exhibits itself in adorning or refining the shapes of useful
 objects. Precious metals and gems are so profuse among them, that they are
 lavished on things devoted to purposes the most commonplace; and their
 love of utility leads them to beautify its tools, and quickens their
 imagination in a way unknown to themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In all service, whether in or out of doors, they make great use of
 automaton figures, which are so ingenious, and so pliant to the operations
 of vril, that they actually seem gifted with reason. It was scarcely
 possible to distinguish the figures I beheld, apparently guiding or
 superintending the rapid movements of vast engines, from human forms
 endowed with thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By degrees, as we continued to walk on, my attention became roused by the
 lively and acute remarks of my companion. The intelligence of the children
 among this race is marvellously precocious, perhaps from the habit of
 having intrusted to them, at so early an age, the toils and
 responsibilities of middle age. Indeed, in conversing with Taee, I felt as
 if talking with some superior and observant man of my own years. I asked
 him if he could form any estimate of the number of communities into which
 the race of the Vril-ya is subdivided.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not exactly," he said, "because they multiply, of course, every year as
 the surplus of each community is drafted off. But I heard my father say
 that, according to the last report, there were a million and a half of
 communities speaking our language, and adopting our institutions and forms
 of life and government; but, I believe, with some differences, about which
 you had better ask Zee. She knows more than most of the Ana do. An An
 cares less for things that do not concern him than a Gy does; the Gy-ei
 are inquisitive creatures."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does each community restrict itself to the same number of families or
 amount of population that you do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; some have much smaller populations, some have larger?varying
 according to the extent of the country they appropriate, or to the degree
 of excellence to which they have brought their machinery. Each community
 sets its own limit according to circumstances, taking care always that
 there shall never arise any class of poor by the pressure of population
 upon the productive powers of the domain; and that no state shall be too
 large for a government resembling that of a single well-ordered family. I
 imagine that no vril community exceeds thirty-thousand households. But, as
 a general rule, the smaller the community, provided there be hands enough
 to do justice to the capacities of the territory it occupies, the richer
 each individual is, and the larger the sum contributed to the general
 treasury,?above all, the happier and the more tranquil is the whole
 political body, and the more perfect the products of its industry. The
 state which all tribes of the Vril-ya acknowledge to be the highest in
 civilisation, and which has brought the vril force to its fullest
 development, is perhaps the smallest. It limits itself to four thousand
 families; but every inch of its territory is cultivated to the utmost
 perfection of garden ground; its machinery excels that of every other
 tribe, and there is no product of its industry in any department which is
 not sought for, at extraordinary prices, by each community of our race.
 All our tribes make this state their model, considering that we should
 reach the highest state of civilisation allowed to mortals if we could
 unite the greatest degree of happiness with the highest degree of
 intellectual achievement; and it is clear that the smaller the society the
 less difficult that will be. Ours is too large for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This reply set me thinking. I reminded myself of that little state of
 Athens, with only twenty thousand free citizens, and which to this day our
 mightiest nations regard as the supreme guide and model in all departments
 of intellect. But then Athens permitted fierce rivalry and perpetual
 change, and was certainly not happy. Rousing myself from the reverie into
 which these reflections had plunged me, I brought back our talk to the
 subjects connected with emigration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," said I, "when, I suppose yearly, a certain number among you agree
 to quit home and found a new community elsewhere, they must necessarily be
 very few, and scarcely sufficient, even with the help of the machines they
 take with them, to clear the ground, and build towns, and form a civilised
 state with the comforts and luxuries in which they had been reared."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mistake. All the tribes of the Vril-ya are in constant communication
 with each other, and settle amongst themselves each year what proportion
 of one community will unite with the emigrants of another, so as to form a
 state of sufficient size; and the place for emigration is agreed upon at
 least a year before, and pioneers sent from each state to level rocks, and
 embank waters, and construct houses; so that when the emigrants at last
 go, they find a city already made, and a country around it at least
 partially cleared. Our hardy life as children make us take cheerfully to
 travel and adventure. I mean to emigrate myself when of age."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do the emigrants always select places hitherto uninhabited and barren?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As yet generally, because it is our rule never to destroy except when
 necessary to our well-being. Of course, we cannot settle in lands already
 occupied by the Vril-ya; and if we take the cultivated lands of the other
 races of Ana, we must utterly destroy the previous inhabitants. Sometimes,
 as it is, we take waste spots, and find that a troublesome, quarrelsome
 race of Ana, especially if under the administration of Koom-Posh or
 Glek-Nas, resents our vicinity, and picks a quarrel with us; then, of
 course, as menacing our welfare, we destroy it: there is no coming to
 terms of peace with a race so idiotic that it is always changing the form
 of government which represents it. Koom-Posh," said the child,
 emphatically, "is bad enough, still it has brains, though at the back of
 its head, and is not without a heart; but in Glek-Nas the brain and heart
 of the creatures disappear, and they become all jaws, claws, and belly."
 "You express yourself strongly. Allow me to inform you that I myself, and
 I am proud to say it, am the citizen of a Koom-Posh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I no longer," answered Taee, "wonder to see you here so far from your
 home. What was the condition of your native community before it became a
 Koom-Posh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A settlement of emigrants?like those settlements which your tribe
 sends forth?but so far unlike your settlements, that it was
 dependent on the state from which it came. It shook off that yoke, and,
 crowned with eternal glory, became a Koom-Posh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eternal glory! How long has the Koom-Posh lasted?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About 100 years."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The length of an An's life?a very young community. In much less
 than another 100 years your Koom-Posh will be a Glek-Nas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, the oldest states in the world I come from, have such faith in its
 duration, that they are all gradually shaping their institutions so as to
 melt into ours, and their most thoughtful politicians say that, whether
 they like it or not, the inevitable tendency of these old states is
 towards Koom-Posh-erie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The old states?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, the old states."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With populations very small in proportion to the area of productive
 land?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the contrary, with populations very large in proportion to that area."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see! old states indeed!?so old as to become drivelling if they
 don't pack off that surplus population as we do ours?very old
 states!?very, very old! Pray, Tish, do you think it wise for very
 old men to try to turn head-over-heels as very young children do? And if
 you ask them why they attempted such antics, should you not laugh if they
 answered that by imitating very young children they could become very
 young children themselves? Ancient history abounds with instances of this
 sort a great many thousand years ago?and in every instance a very
 old state that played at Koom-Posh soon tumbled into Glek-Nas. Then, in
 horror of its own self, it cried out for a master, as an old man in his
 dotage cries out for a nurse; and after a succession of masters or nurses,
 more or less long, that very old state died out of history. A very old
 state attempting Koom-Posh-erie is like a very old man who pulls down the
 house to which he has been accustomed, but he has so exhausted his vigour
 in pulling down, that all he can do in the way of rebuilding is to run up
 a crazy hut, in which himself and his successors whine out, 'How the wind
 blows! How the walls shake!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear Taee, I make all excuse for your unenlightened prejudices, which
 every schoolboy educated in a Koom-Posh could easily controvert, though he
 might not be so precociously learned in ancient history as you appear to
 be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I learned! not a bit of it. But would a schoolboy, educated in your
 Koom-Posh, ask his great-great-grandfather or great-great-grandmother to
 stand on his or her head with the feet uppermost? And if the poor old
 folks hesitated?say, 'What do you fear??see how I do it!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Taee, I disdain to argue with a child of your age. I repeat, I make
 allowances for your want of that culture which a Koom-Posh alone can
 bestow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I, in my turn," answered Taee, with an air of the suave but lofty good
 breeding which characterises his race, "not only make allowances for you
 as not educated among the Vril-ya, but I entreat you to vouchsafe me your
 pardon for the insufficient respect to the habits and opinions of so
 amiable a Tish!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I ought before to have observed that I was commonly called Tish by my host
 and his family, as being a polite and indeed a pet name, literally
 signifying a small barbarian; the children apply it endearingly to the
 tame species of Frog which they keep in their gardens.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had now reached the banks of a lake, and Taee here paused to point out
 to me the ravages made in fields skirting it. "The enemy certainly lies
 within these waters," said Taee. "Observe what shoals of fish are crowded
 together at the margin. Even the great fishes with the small ones, who are
 their habitual prey and who generally shun them, all forget their
 instincts in the presence of a common destroyer. This reptile certainly
 must belong to the class of Krek-a, which are more devouring than any
 other, and are said to be among the few surviving species of the world's
 dreadest inhabitants before the Ana were created. The appetite of a Krek
 is insatiable?it feeds alike upon vegetable and animal life; but for
 the swift-footed creatures of the elk species it is too slow in its
 movements. Its favourite dainty is an An when it can catch him unawares;
 and hence the Ana destroy it relentlessly whenever it enters their
 dominion. I have heard that when our forefathers first cleared this
 country, these monsters, and others like them, abounded, and, vril being
 then undiscovered, many of our race were devoured. It was impossible to
 exterminate them wholly till that discovery which constitutes the power
 and sustains the civilisation of our race. But after the uses of vril
 became familiar to us, all creatures inimical to us were soon annihilated.
 Still, once a-year or so, one of these enormous creatures wanders from the
 unreclaimed and savage districts beyond, and within my memory one has
 seized upon a young Gy who was bathing in this very lake. Had she been on
 land and armed with her staff, it would not have dared even to show
 itself; for, like all savage creatures, the reptile has a marvellous
 instinct, which warns it against the bearer of the vril wand. How they
 teach their young to avoid him, though seen for the first time, is one of
 those mysteries which you may ask Zee to explain, for I cannot. The
 reptile in this instinct does but resemble our wild birds and animals,
 which will not come in reach of a man armed with a gun. When the electric
 wires were first put up, partridges struck against them in their flight,
 and fell down wounded. No younger generations of partridges meet with a
 similar accident. So long as I stand here, the monster will not stir from
 its lurking-place; but we must now decoy it forth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will that not be difficult?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all. Seat yourself yonder on that crag (about one hundred yards
 from the bank), while I retire to a distance. In a short time the reptile
 will catch sight or scent of you, and perceiving that you are no
 vril-bearer, will come forth to devour you. As soon as it is fairly out of
 the water, it becomes my prey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you mean to tell me that I am to be the decoy to that horrible monster
 which could engulf me within its jaws in a second! I beg to decline."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The child laughed. "Fear nothing," said he; "only sit still."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Instead of obeying the command, I made a bound, and was about to take
 fairly to my heels, when Taee touched me slightly on the shoulder, and,
 fixing his eyes steadily on mine, I was rooted to the spot. All power of
 volition left me. Submissive to the infant's gesture, I followed him to
 the crag he had indicated, and seated myself there in silence. Most
 readers have seen something of the effects of electro-biology, whether
 genuine or spurious. No professor of that doubtful craft had ever been
 able to influence a thought or a movement of mine, but I was a mere
 machine at the will of this terrible child. Meanwhile he expanded his
 wings, soared aloft, and alighted amidst a copse at the brow of a hill at
 some distance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was alone; and turning my eyes with an indescribable sensation of horror
 towards the lake, I kept them fixed on its water, spell-bound. It might be
 ten or fifteen minutes, to me it seemed ages, before the still surface,
 gleaming under the lamplight, began to be agitated towards the centre. At
 the same time the shoals of fish near the margin evinced their sense of
 the enemy's approach by splash and leap and bubbling circle. I could
 detect their hurried flight hither and thither, some even casting
 themselves ashore. A long, dark, undulous furrow came moving along the
 waters, nearer and nearer, till the vast head of the reptile emerged?its
 jaws bristling with fangs, and its dull eyes fixing themselves hungrily on
 the spot where I sat motionless. And now its fore feet were on the strand?now
 its enormous breast, scaled on either side as in armour, in the centre
 showing its corrugated skin of a dull venomous yellow; and now its whole
 length was on the land, a hundred feet or more from the jaw to the tail.
 Another stride of those ghastly feet would have brought it to the spot
 where I sat. There was but a moment between me and this grim form of
 death, when what seemed a flash of lightning shot through the air, smote,
 and, for a space of time briefer than that in which a man can draw his
 breath, enveloped the monster; and then, as the flash vanished, there lay
 before me a blackened, charred, smouldering mass, a something gigantic,
 but of which even the outlines of form were burned away, and rapidly
 crumbling into dust and ashes. I remained still seated, still speechless,
 ice-cold with a new sensation of dread; what had been horror was now awe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I felt the child's hand on my head?fear left me?the spell was
 broken?I rose up. "You see with what ease the Vril-ya destroy their
 enemies," said Taee; and then, moving towards the bank, he contemplated
 the smouldering relics of the monster, and said quietly, "I have destroyed
 larger creatures, but none with so much pleasure. Yes, it IS a Krek; what
 suffering it must have inflicted while it lived!" Then he took up the poor
 fishes that had flung themselves ashore, and restored them mercifully to
 their native element.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIX.
 </h2>
 <p>
 As we walked back to the town, Taee took a new and circuitous way, in
 order to show me what, to use a familiar term, I will call the 'Station,'
 from which emigrants or travellers to other communities commence their
 journeys. I had, on a former occasion, expressed a wish to see their
 vehicles. These I found to be of two kinds, one for land journeys, one for
 aerial voyages: the former were of all sizes and forms, some not larger
 than an ordinary carriage, some movable houses of one story and containing
 several rooms, furnished according to the ideas of comfort or luxury which
 are entertained by the Vril-ya. The aerial vehicles were of light
 substances, not the least resembling our balloons, but rather our boats
 and pleasure-vessels, with helm and rudder, with large wings or paddles,
 and a central machine worked by vril. All the vehicles both for land or
 air were indeed worked by that potent and mysterious agency.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I saw a convoy set out on its journey, but it had few passengers,
 containing chiefly articles of merchandise, and was bound to a
 neighbouring community; for among all the tribes of the Vril-ya there is
 considerable commercial interchange. I may here observe, that their money
 currency does not consist of the precious metals, which are too common
 among them for that purpose. The smaller coins in ordinary use are
 manufactured from a peculiar fossil shell, the comparatively scarce
 remnant of some very early deluge, or other convulsion of nature, by which
 a species has become extinct. It is minute, and flat as an oyster, and
 takes a jewel-like polish. This coinage circulates among all the tribes of
 the Vril-ya. Their larger transactions are carried on much like ours, by
 bills of exchange, and thin metallic plates which answer the purpose of
 our bank-notes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let me take this occasion of adding that the taxation among the tribe I
 became acquainted with was very considerable, compared with the amount of
 population. But I never heard that any one grumbled at it, for it was
 devoted to purposes of universal utility, and indeed necessary to the
 civilisation of the tribe. The cost of lighting so large a range of
 country, of providing for emigration, of maintaining the public buildings
 at which the various operations of national intellect were carried on,
 from the first education of an infant to the departments in which the
 College of Sages were perpetually trying new experiments in mechanical
 science; all these involved the necessity for considerable state funds. To
 these I must add an item that struck me as very singular. I have said that
 all the human labour required by the state is carried on by children up to
 the marriageable age. For this labour the state pays, and at a rate
 immeasurably higher than our own remuneration to labour even in the United
 States. According to their theory, every child, male or female, on
 attaining the marriageable age, and there terminating the period of
 labour, should have acquired enough for an independent competence during
 life. As, no matter what the disparity of fortune in the parents, all the
 children must equally serve, so all are equally paid according to their
 several ages or the nature of their work. Where the parents or friends
 choose to retain a child in their own service, they must pay into the
 public fund in the same ratio as the state pays to the children it
 employs; and this sum is handed over to the child when the period of
 service expires. This practice serves, no doubt, to render the notion of
 social equality familiar and agreeable; and if it may be said that all the
 children form a democracy, no less truly it may be said that all the
 adults form an aristocracy. The exquisite politeness and refinement of
 manners among the Vril-ya, the generosity of their sentiments, the
 absolute leisure they enjoy for following out their own private pursuits,
 the amenities of their domestic intercourse, in which they seem as members
 of one noble order that can have no distrust of each other's word or deed,
 all combine to make the Vril-ya the most perfect nobility which a
 political disciple of Plato or Sidney could conceive for the ideal of an
 aristocratic republic.

 <h2>
 Chapter XX.
 </h2>
 <p>
 From the date of the expedition with Taee which I have just narrated, the
 child paid me frequent visits. He had taken a liking to me, which I
 cordially returned. Indeed, as he was not yet twelve years old, and had
 not commenced the course of scientific studies with which childhood closes
 in that country, my intellect was less inferior to his than to that of the
 elder members of his race, especially of the Gy-ei, and most especially of
 the accomplished Zee. The children of the Vril-ya, having upon their minds
 the weight of so many active duties and grave responsibilities, are not
 generally mirthful; but Taee, with all his wisdom, had much of the playful
 good-humour one often finds the characteristic of elderly men of genius.
 He felt that sort of pleasure in my society which a boy of a similar age
 in the upper world has in the company of a pet dog or monkey. It amused
 him to try and teach me the ways of his people, as it amuses a nephew of
 mine to make his poodle walk on his hind legs or jump through a hoop. I
 willingly lent myself to such experiments, but I never achieved the
 success of the poodle. I was very much interested at first in the attempt
 to ply the wings which the youngest of the Vril-ya use as nimbly and
 easily as ours do their legs and arms; but my efforts were attended with
 contusions serious enough to make me abandon them in despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These wings, as I before said, are very large, reaching to the knee, and
 in repose thrown back so as to form a very graceful mantle. They are
 composed from the feathers of a gigantic bird that abounds in the rocky
 heights of the country?the colour mostly white, but sometimes with
 reddish streaks. They are fastened round the shoulders with light but
 strong springs of steel; and, when expanded, the arms slide through loops
 for that purpose, forming, as it were, a stout central membrane. As the
 arms are raised, a tubular lining beneath the vest or tunic becomes, by
 mechanical contrivance inflated with air, increased or diminished at will
 by the movement of the arms, and serving to buoy the whole form as on
 bladders. The wings and the balloon-like apparatus are highly charged with
 vril; and when the body is thus wafted upward, it seems to become
 singularly lightened of its weight. I found it easy enough to soar from
 the ground; indeed, when the wings were spread it was scarcely possible
 not to soar, but then came the difficulty and the danger. I utterly failed
 in the power to use and direct the pinions, though I am considered among
 my own race unusually alert and ready in bodily exercises, and am a very
 practiced swimmer. I could only make the most confused and blundering
 efforts at flight. I was the servant of the wings; the wings were not my
 servants?they were beyond my control; and when by a violent strain
 of muscle, and, I must fairly own, in that abnormal strength which is
 given by excessive fright, I curbed their gyrations and brought them near
 to the body, it seemed as if I lost the sustaining power stored in them
 and the connecting bladders, as when the air is let out of a balloon, and
 found myself precipitated again to the earth; saved, indeed, by some
 spasmodic flutterings, from being dashed to pieces, but not saved from the
 bruises and the stun of a heavy fall. I would, however, have persevered in
 my attempts, but for the advice or the commands of the scientific Zee, who
 had benevolently accompanied my flutterings, and, indeed, on the last
 occasion, flying just under me, received my form as it fell on her own
 expanded wings, and preserved me from breaking my head on the roof of the
 pyramid from which we had ascended.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see," she said, "that your trials are in vain, not from the fault of
 the wings and their appurtenances, nor from any imperfectness and
 malformation of your own corpuscular system, but from irremediable,
 because organic, defect in your power of volition. Learn that the
 connection between the will and the agencies of that fluid which has been
 subjected to the control of the Vril-ya was never established by the first
 discoverers, never achieved by a single generation; it has gone on
 increasing, like other properties of race, in proportion as it has been
 uniformly transmitted from parent to child, so that, at last, it has
 become an instinct; and an infant An of our race wills to fly as
 intuitively and unconsciously as he wills to walk. He thus plies his
 invented or artificial wings with as much safety as a bird plies those
 with which it is born. I did not think sufficiently of this when I allowed
 you to try an experiment which allured me, for I have longed to have in
 you a companion. I shall abandon the experiment now. Your life is becoming
 dear to me." Herewith the Gy's voice and face softened, and I felt more
 seriously alarmed than I had been in my previous flights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now that I am on the subject of wings, I ought not to omit mention of a
 custom among the Gy-ei which seems to me very pretty and tender in the
 sentiment it implies. A Gy wears wings habitually when yet a virgin?she
 joins the Ana in their aerial sports?she adventures alone and afar
 into the wilder regions of the sunless world: in the boldness and height
 of her soarings, not less than in the grace of her movements, she excels
 the opposite sex. But, from the day of her marriage she wears wings no
 more, she suspends them with her own willing hand over the nuptial couch,
 never to be resumed unless the marriage tie be severed by divorce or
 death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now when Zee's voice and eyes thus softened?and at that softening I
 prophetically recoiled and shuddered?Taee, who had accompanied us in
 our flights, but who, child-like, had been much more amused with my
 awkwardness, than sympathising in my fears or aware of my danger, hovered
 over us, poised amidst spread wings, and hearing the endearing words of
 the young Gy, laughed aloud. Said he, "If the Tish cannot learn the use of
 wings, you may still be his companion, Zee, for you can suspend your own."

 <h2>
 Chapter XXI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I had for some time observed in my host's highly informed and powerfully
 proportioned daughter that kindly and protective sentiment which, whether
 above the earth or below it, an all-wise Providence has bestowed upon the
 feminine division of the human race. But until very lately I had ascribed
 it to that affection for 'pets' which a human female at every age shares
 with a human child. I now became painfully aware that the feeling with
 which Zee deigned to regard me was different from that which I had
 inspired in Taee. But this conviction gave me none of that complacent
 gratification which the vanity of man ordinarily conceives from a
 flattering appreciation of his personal merits on the part of the fair
 sex; on the contrary, it inspired me with fear. Yet of all the Gy-ei in
 the community, if Zee were perhaps the wisest and the strongest, she was,
 by common repute, the gentlest, and she was certainly the most popularly
 beloved. The desire to aid, to succour, to protect, to comfort, to bless,
 seemed to pervade her whole being. Though the complicated miseries that
 originate in penury and guilt are unknown to the social system of the
 Vril-ya, still, no sage had yet discovered in vril an agency which could
 banish sorrow from life; and wherever amongst her people sorrow found its
 way, there Zee followed in the mission of comforter. Did some sister Gy
 fail to secure the love she sighed for? Zee sought her out, and brought
 all the resources of her lore, and all the consolations of her sympathy,
 to bear upon a grief that so needs the solace of a confidant. In the rare
 cases, when grave illness seized upon childhood or youth, and the cases,
 less rare, when, in the hardy and adventurous probation of infants, some
 accident, attended with pain and injury occurred, Zee forsook her studies
 and her sports, and became the healer and nurse. Her favourite flights
 were towards the extreme boundaries of the domain where children were
 stationed on guard against outbreaks of warring forces in nature, or the
 invasions of devouring animals, so that she might warn them of any peril
 which her knowledge detected or foresaw, or be at hand if any harm had
 befallen. Nay, even in the exercise of her scientific acquirements there
 was a concurrent benevolence of purpose and will. Did she learn any
 novelty in invention that would be useful to the practitioner of some
 special art or craft? she hastened to communicate and explain it. Was some
 veteran sage of the College perplexed and wearied with the toil of an
 abstruse study? she would patiently devote herself to his aid, work out
 details for him, sustain his spirits with her hopeful smile, quicken his
 wit with her luminous suggestion, be to him, as it were, his own good
 genius made visible as the strengthener and inspirer. The same tenderness
 she exhibited to the inferior creatures. I have often known her bring home
 some sick and wounded animal, and tend and cherish it as a mother would
 tend and cherish her stricken child. Many a time when I sat in the
 balcony, or hanging garden, on which my window opened, I have watched her
 rising in the air on her radiant wings, and in a few moments groups of
 infants below, catching sight of her, would soar upward with joyous sounds
 of greeting; clustering and sporting around her, so that she seemed a very
 centre of innocent delight. When I have walked with her amidst the rocks
 and valleys without the city, the elk-deer would scent or see her from
 afar, come bounding up, eager for the caress of her hand, or follow her
 footsteps, till dismissed by some musical whisper that the creature had
 learned to comprehend. It is the fashion among the virgin Gy-ei to wear on
 their foreheads a circlet, or coronet, with gems resembling opals,
 arranged in four points or rays like stars. These are lustreless in
 ordinary use, but if touched by the vril wand they take a clear lambent
 flame, which illuminates, yet not burns. This serves as an ornament in
 their festivities, and as a lamp, if, in their wanderings beyond their
 artificial lights, they have to traverse the dark. There are times, when I
 have seen Zee's thoughtful majesty of face lighted up by this crowning
 halo, that I could scarcely believe her to be a creature of mortal birth,
 and bent my head before her as the vision of a being among the celestial
 orders. But never once did my heart feel for this lofty type of the
 noblest womanhood a sentiment of human love. Is it that, among the race I
 belong to, man's pride so far influences his passions that woman loses to
 him her special charm of woman if he feels her to be in all things
 eminently superior to himself? But by what strange infatuation could this
 peerless daughter of a race which, in the supremacy of its powers and the
 felicity of its conditions, ranked all other races in the category of
 barbarians, have deigned to honour me with her preference? In personal
 qualifications, though I passed for good-looking amongst the people I came
 from, the handsomest of my countrymen might have seemed insignificant and
 homely beside the grand and serene type of beauty which characterised the
 aspect of the Vril-ya.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That novelty, the very difference between myself and those to whom Zee was
 accustomed, might serve to bias her fancy was probable enough, and as the
 reader will see later, such a cause might suffice to account for the
 predilection with which I was distinguished by a young Gy scarcely out of
 her childhood, and very inferior in all respects to Zee. But whoever will
 consider those tender characteristics which I have just ascribed to the
 daughter of Aph-Lin, may readily conceive that the main cause of my
 attraction to her was in her instinctive desire to cherish, to comfort, to
 protect, and, in protecting, to sustain and to exalt. Thus, when I look
 back, I account for the only weakness unworthy of her lofty nature, which
 bowed the daughter of the Vril-ya to a woman's affection for one so
 inferior to herself as was her father's guest. But be the cause what it
 may, the consciousness that I had inspired such affection thrilled me with
 awe?a moral awe of her very imperfections, of her mysterious powers,
 of the inseparable distinctions between her race and my own; and with that
 awe, I must confess to my shame, there combined the more material and
 ignoble dread of the perils to which her preference would expose me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Under these anxious circumstances, fortunately, my conscience and sense of
 honour were free from reproach. It became clearly my duty, if Zee's
 preference continued manifest, to intimate it to my host, with, of course,
 all the delicacy which is ever to be preserved by a well-bred man in
 confiding to another any degree of favour by which one of the fair sex may
 condescend to distinguish him. Thus, at all events, I should be freed from
 responsibility or suspicion of voluntary participation in the sentiments
 of Zee; and the superior wisdom of my host might probably suggest some
 sage extrication from my perilous dilemma. In this resolve I obeyed the
 ordinary instinct of civilised and moral man, who, erring though he be,
 still generally prefers the right course in those cases where it is
 obviously against his inclinations, his interests, and his safety to elect
 the wrong one.

 <h2>
 Chapter XXII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 As the reader has seen, Aph-Lin had not favoured my general and
 unrestricted intercourse with his countrywomen. Though relying on my
 promise to abstain from giving any information as to the world I had left,
 and still more on the promise of those to whom had been put the same
 request, not to question me, which Zee had exacted from Taee, yet he did
 not feel sure that, if I were allowed to mix with the strangers whose
 curiosity the sight of me had aroused, I could sufficiently guard myself
 against their inquiries. When I went out, therefore, it was never alone; I
 was always accompanied either by one of my host's family, or my
 child-friend Taee. Bra, Aph-Lin's wife, seldom stirred beyond the gardens
 which surrounded the house, and was fond of reading the ancient
 literature, which contained something of romance and adventure not to be
 found in the writings of recent ages, and presented pictures of a life
 unfamiliar to her experience and interesting to her imagination; pictures,
 indeed, of a life more resembling that which we lead every day above
 ground, coloured by our sorrows, sins, passions, and much to her what the
 tales of the Genii or the Arabian Nights are to us. But her love of
 reading did not prevent Bra from the discharge of her duties as mistress
 of the largest household in the city. She went daily the round of the
 chambers, and saw that the automata and other mechanical contrivances were
 in order, that the numerous children employed by Aph-Lin, whether in his
 private or public capacity, were carefully tended. Bra also inspected the
 accounts of the whole estate, and it was her great delight to assist her
 husband in the business connected with his office as chief administrator
 of the Lighting Department, so that her avocations necessarily kept her
 much within doors. The two sons were both completing their education at
 the College of Sages; and the elder, who had a strong passion for
 mechanics, and especially for works connected with the machinery of
 timepieces and automata, had decided on devoting himself to these
 pursuits, and was now occupied in constructing a shop or warehouse, at
 which his inventions could be exhibited and sold. The younger son
 preferred farming and rural occupations; and when not attending the
 College, at which he chiefly studied the theories of agriculture, was much
 absorbed by his practical application of that science to his father's
 lands. It will be seen by this how completely equality of ranks is
 established among this people?a shopkeeper being of exactly the same
 grade in estimation as the large landed proprietor. Aph-Lin was the
 wealthiest member of the community, and his eldest son preferred keeping a
 shop to any other avocation; nor was this choice thought to show any want
 of elevated notions on his part.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This young man had been much interested in examining my watch, the works
 of which were new to him, and was greatly pleased when I made him a
 present of it. Shortly after, he returned the gift with interest, by a
 watch of his own construction, marking both the time as in my watch and
 the time as kept among the Vril-ya. I have that watch still, and it has
 been much admired by many among the most eminent watchmakers of London and
 Paris. It is of gold, with diamond hands and figures, and it plays a
 favorite tune among the Vril-ya in striking the hours: it only requires to
 be wound up once in ten months, and has never gone wrong since I had it.
 These young brothers being thus occupied, my usual companions in that
 family, when I went abroad, were my host or his daughter. Now, agreeably
 with the honourable conclusions I had come to, I began to excuse myself
 from Zee's invitations to go out alone with her, and seized an occasion
 when that learned Gy was delivering a lecture at the College of Sages to
 ask Aph-Lin to show me his country-seat. As this was at some little
 distance, and as Aph-Lin was not fond of walking, while I had discreetly
 relinquished all attempts at flying, we proceeded to our destination in
 one of the aerial boats belonging to my host. A child of eight years old,
 in his employ, was our conductor. My host and myself reclined on cushions,
 and I found the movement very easy and luxurious. "Aph-Lin," said I, "you
 will not, I trust, be displeased with me, if I ask your permission to
 travel for a short time, and visit other tribes or communities of your
 illustrious race. I have also a strong desire to see those nations which
 do not adopt your institutions, and which you consider as savages. It
 would interest me greatly to notice what are the distinctions between them
 and the races whom we consider civilised in the world I have left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is utterly impossible that you should go hence alone," said Aph-Lin.
 "Even among the Vril-ya you would be exposed to great dangers. Certain
 peculiarities of formation and colour, and the extraordinary phenomenon of
 hirsute bushes upon your cheeks and chin, denoting in you a species of An
 distinct alike from our own race and any known race of barbarians yet
 extant, would attract, of course, the special attention of the College of
 Sages in whatever community of Vril-ya you visited, and it would depend
 upon the individual temper of some individual sage whether you would be
 received, as you have been here, hospitably, or whether you would not be
 at once dissected for scientific purposes. Know that when the Tur first
 took you to his house, and while you were there put to sleep by Taee in
 order to recover from your previous pain or fatigue, the sages summoned by
 the Tur were divided in opinion whether you were a harmless or an
 obnoxious animal. During your unconscious state your teeth were examined,
 and they clearly showed that you were not only graminivorous but
 carnivorous. Carnivorous animals of your size are always destroyed, as
 being of savage and dangerous nature. Our teeth, as you have doubtless
 observed,* are not those of the creatures who devour flesh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * I never had observed it; and, if I had, am not physiologist enough to
 have distinguished the difference.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is, indeed, maintained by Zee and other philosophers, that as, in
 remote ages, the Ana did prey upon living beings of the brute species,
 their teeth must have been fitted for that purpose. But, even if so, they
 have been modified by hereditary transmission, and suited to the food on
 which we now exist; nor are even the barbarians, who adopt the turbulent
 and ferocious institutions of Glek-Nas, devourers of flesh like beasts of
 prey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the course of this dispute it was proposed to dissect you; but Taee
 begged you off, and the Tur being, by office, averse to all novel
 experiments at variance with our custom of sparing life, except where it
 is clearly proved to be for the good of the community to take it, sent to
 me, whose business it is, as the richest man of the state, to afford
 hospitality to strangers from a distance. It was at my option to decide
 whether or not you were a stranger whom I could safely admit. Had I
 declined to receive you, you would have been handed over to the College of
 Sages, and what might there have befallen you I do not like to conjecture.
 Apart from this danger, you might chance to encounter some child of four
 years old, just put in possession of his vril staff; and who, in alarm at
 your strange appearance, and in the impulse of the moment, might reduce
 you to a cinder. Taee himself was about to do so when he first saw you,
 had his father not checked his hand. Therefore I say you cannot travel
 alone, but with Zee you would be safe; and I have no doubt that she would
 accompany you on a tour round the neighbouring communities of Vril-ya (to
 the savage states, No!): I will ask her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, as my main object in proposing to travel was to escape from Zee, I
 hastily exclaimed, "Nay, pray do not! I relinquish my design. You have
 said enough as to its dangers to deter me from it; and I can scarcely
 think it right that a young Gy of the personal attractions of your lovely
 daughter should travel into other regions without a better protector than
 a Tish of my insignificant strength and stature."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aph-Lin emitted the soft sibilant sound which is the nearest approach to
 laughter that a full-grown An permits to himself, ere he replied: "Pardon
 my discourteous but momentary indulgence of mirth at any observation
 seriously made by my guest. I could not but be amused at the idea of Zee,
 who is so fond of protecting others that children call her 'THE GUARDIAN,'
 needing a protector herself against any dangers arising from the audacious
 admiration of males. Know that our Gy-ei, while unmarried, are accustomed
 to travel alone among other tribes, to see if they find there some An who
 may please them more than the Ana they find at home. Zee has already made
 three such journeys, but hitherto her heart has been untouched."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here the opportunity which I sought was afforded to me, and I said,
 looking down, and with faltering voice, "Will you, my kind host, promise
 to pardon me, if what I am about to say gives offence?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say only the truth, and I cannot be offended; or, could I be so, it would
 not be for me, but for you to pardon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, assist me to quit you, and, much as I should have like to
 witness more of the wonders, and enjoy more of the felicity, which belong
 to your people, let me return to my own."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I fear there are reasons why I cannot do that; at all events, not without
 permission of the Tur, and he, probably, would not grant it. You are not
 destitute of intelligence; you may (though I do not think so) have
 concealed the degree of destructive powers possessed by your people; you
 might, in short, bring upon us some danger; and if the Tur entertains that
 idea, it would clearly be his duty, either to put an end to you, or
 enclose you in a cage for the rest of your existence. But why should you
 wish to leave a state of society which you so politely allow to be more
 felicitous than your own?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Aph-Lin! My answer is plain. Lest in naught, and unwittingly, I
 should betray your hospitality; lest, in the caprice of will which in our
 world is proverbial among the other sex, and from which even a Gy is not
 free, your adorable daughter should deign to regard me, though a Tish, as
 if I were a civilised An, and?and?and?-" "Court you as
 her spouse," put in Aph-Lin, gravely, and without any visible sign of
 surprise or displeasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have said it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That would be a misfortune," resumed my host, after a pause, "and I feel
 you have acted as you ought in warning me. It is, as you imply, not
 uncommon for an unwedded Gy to conceive tastes as to the object she covets
 which appear whimsical to others; but there is no power to compel a young
 Gy to any course opposed to that which she chooses to pursue. All we can
 to is to reason with her, and experience tells us that the whole College
 of Sages would find it vain to reason with a Gy in a matter that concerns
 her choice in love. I grieve for you, because such a marriage would be
 against the A-glauran, or good of the community, for the children of such
 a marriage would adulterate the race: they might even come into the world
 with the teeth of carnivorous animals; this could not be allowed: Zee, as
 a Gy, cannot be controlled; but you, as a Tish, can be destroyed. I advise
 you, then, to resist her addresses; to tell her plainly that you can never
 return her love. This happens constantly. Many an An, however, ardently
 wooed by one Gy, rejects her, and puts an end to her persecution by
 wedding another. The same course is open to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; for I cannot wed another Gy without equally injuring the community,
 and exposing it to the chance of rearing carnivorous children."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true. All I can say, and I say it with the tenderness due to a
 Tish, and the respect due to a guest, is frankly this?if you yield,
 you will become a cinder. I must leave it to you to take the best way you
 can to defend yourself. Perhaps you had better tell Zee that she is ugly.
 That assurance on the lips of him she woos generally suffices to chill the
 most ardent Gy. Here we are at my country-house."

 <h2>
 Chapter XXIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I confess that my conversation with Aph-Lin, and the extreme coolness with
 which he stated his inability to control the dangerous caprice of his
 daughter, and treated the idea of the reduction into a cinder to which her
 amorous flame might expose my too seductive person, took away the pleasure
 I should otherwise have had in the contemplation of my host's
 country-seat, and the astonishing perfection of the machinery by which his
 farming operations were conducted. The house differed in appearance from
 the massive and sombre building which Aph-Lin inhabited in the city, and
 which seemed akin to the rocks out of which the city itself had been hewn
 into shape. The walls of the country-seat were composed by trees placed a
 few feet apart from each other, the interstices being filled in with the
 transparent metallic substance which serves the purpose of glass among the
 Ana. These trees were all in flower, and the effect was very pleasing, if
 not in the best taste. We were received at the porch by life-like
 automata, who conducted us into a chamber, the like to which I never saw
 before, but have often on summer days dreamily imagined. It was a bower?half
 room, half garden. The walls were one mass of climbing flowers. The open
 spaces, which we call windows, and in which, here, the metallic surfaces
 were slided back, commanded various views; some, of the wide landscape
 with its lakes and rocks; some, of small limited expanses answering to our
 conservatories, filled with tiers of flowers. Along the sides of the room
 were flower-beds, interspersed with cushions for repose. In the centre of
 the floor was a cistern and a fountain of that liquid light which I have
 presumed to be naphtha. It was luminous and of a roseate hue; it sufficed
 without lamps to light up the room with a subdued radiance. All around the
 fountain was carpeted with a soft deep lichen, not green (I have never
 seen that colour in the vegetation of this country), but a quiet brown, on
 which the eye reposes with the same sense of relief as that with which in
 the upper world it reposes on green. In the outlets upon flowers (which I
 have compared to our conservatories) there were singing birds innumerable,
 which, while we remained in the room, sang in those harmonies of tune to
 which they are, in these parts, so wonderfully trained. The roof was open.
 The whole scene had charms for every sense?music form the birds,
 fragrance from the flowers, and varied beauty to the eye at every aspect.
 About all was a voluptuous repose. What a place, methought, for a
 honeymoon, if a Gy bride were a little less formidably armed not only with
 the rights of woman, but with the powers of man! But when one thinks of a
 Gy, so learned, so tall, so stately, so much above the standard of the
 creature we call woman as was Zee, no! even if I had felt no fear of being
 reduced to a cinder, it is not of her I should have dreamed in that bower
 so constructed for dreams of poetic love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The automata reappeared, serving one of those delicious liquids which form
 the innocent wines of the Vril-ya.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Truly," said I, "this is a charming residence, and I can scarcely
 conceive why you do not settle yourself here instead of amid the gloomier
 abodes of the city."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As responsible to the community for the administration of light, I am
 compelled to reside chiefly in the city, and can only come hither for
 short intervals."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But since I understand from you that no honours are attached to your
 office, and it involves some trouble, why do you accept it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Each of us obeys without question the command of the Tur. He said, 'Be it
 requested that Aph-Lin shall be the Commissioner of Light,' so I had no
 choice; but having held the office now for a long time, the cares, which
 were at first unwelcome, have become, if not pleasing, at least endurable.
 We are all formed by custom?even the difference of our race from the
 savage is but the transmitted continuance of custom, which becomes,
 through hereditary descent, part and parcel of our nature. You see there
 are Ana who even reconcile themselves to the responsibilities of chief
 magistrate, but no one would do so if his duties had not been rendered so
 light, or if there were any questions as to compliance with his requests."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not even if you thought the requests unwise or unjust?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We do not allow ourselves to think so, and, indeed, everything goes on as
 if each and all governed themselves according to immemorial custom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When the chief magistrate dies or retires, how do you provide for his
 successor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The An who has discharged the duties of chief magistrate for many years
 is the best person to choose one by whom those duties may be understood,
 and he generally names his successor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "His son, perhaps?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seldom that; for it is not an office any one desires or seeks, and a
 father naturally hesitates to constrain his son. But if the Tur himself
 decline to make a choice, for fear it might be supposed that he owed some
 grudge to the person on whom his choice would settle, then there are three
 of the College of Sages who draw lots among themselves which shall have
 the power to elect the chief. We consider that the judgment of one An of
 ordinary capacity is better than the judgment of three or more, however
 wise they may be; for among three there would probably be disputes, and
 where there are disputes, passion clouds judgment. The worst choice made
 by one who has no motive in choosing wrong, is better than the best choice
 made by many who have many motives for not choosing right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You reverse in your policy the maxims adopted in my country."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you all, in your country, satisfied with your governors?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All! Certainly not; the governors that most please some are sure to be
 those most displeasing to others."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then our system is better than yours." "For you it may be; but according
 to our system a Tish could not be reduced to a cinder if a female
 compelled him to marry her; and as a Tish I sigh to return to my native
 world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take courage, my dear little guest; Zee can't compel you to marry her.
 She can only entice you to do so. Don't be enticed. Come and look round my
 domain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went forth into a close, bordered with sheds; for though the Ana keep
 no stock for food, there are some animals which they rear for milking and
 others for shearing. The former have no resemblance to our cows, nor the
 latter to our sheep, nor do I believe such species exist amongst them.
 They use the milk of three varieties of animal: one resembles the
 antelope, but is much larger, being as tall as a camel; the other two are
 smaller, and, though differing somewhat from each other, resemble no
 creature I ever saw on earth. They are very sleek and of rounded
 proportions; their colour that of the dappled deer, with very mild
 countenances and beautiful dark eyes. The milk of these three creatures
 differs in richness and taste. It is usually diluted with water, and
 flavoured with the juice of a peculiar and perfumed fruit, and in itself
 is very nutritious and palatable. The animal whose fleece serves them for
 clothing and many other purposes, is more like the Italian she-goat than
 any other creature, but is considerably larger, has no horns, and is free
 from the displeasing odour of our goats. Its fleece is not thick, but very
 long and fine; it varies in colour, but is never white, more generally of
 a slate-like or lavender hue. For clothing it is usually worn dyed to suit
 the taste of the wearer. These animals were exceedingly tame, and were
 treated with extraordinary care and affection by the children (chiefly
 female) who tended them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We then went through vast storehouses filled with grains and fruits. I may
 here observe that the main staple of food among these people consists?firstly,
 of a kind of corn much larger in ear than our wheat, and which by culture
 is perpetually being brought into new varieties of flavour; and, secondly,
 of a fruit of about the size of a small orange, which, when gathered, is
 hard and bitter. It is stowed away for many months in their warehouses,
 and then becomes succulent and tender. Its juice, which is of dark-red
 colour, enters into most of their sauces. They have many kinds of fruit of
 the nature of the olive, from which delicious oils are extracted. They
 have a plant somewhat resembling the sugar-cane, but its juices are less
 sweet and of a delicate perfume. They have no bees nor honey-making
 insects, but they make much use of a sweet gum that oozes from a
 coniferous plant, not unlike the araucaria. Their soil teems also with
 esculent roots and vegetables, which it is the aim of their culture to
 improve and vary to the utmost. And I never remember any meal among this
 people, however it might be confined to the family household, in which
 some delicate novelty in such articles of food was not introduced. In
 fine, as I before observed, their cookery is exquisite, so diversified and
 nutritious that one does not miss animal food; and their own physical
 forms suffice to show that with them, at least, meat is not required for
 superior production of muscular fibre. They have no grapes?the
 drinks extracted from their fruits are innocent and refreshing. Their
 staple beverage, however, is water, in the choice of which they are very
 fastidious, distinguishing at once the slightest impurity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My younger son takes great pleasure in augmenting our produce," said
 Aph-Lin as we passed through the storehouses, "and therefore will inherit
 these lands, which constitute the chief part of my wealth. To my elder son
 such inheritance would be a great trouble and affliction."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are there many sons among you who think the inheritance of vast wealth
 would be a great trouble and affliction?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly; there are indeed very few of the Vril-ya who do not consider
 that a fortune much above the average is a heavy burden. We are rather a
 lazy people after the age of childhood, and do not like undergoing more
 cares than we can help, and great wealth does give its owner many cares.
 For instance, it marks us out for public offices, which none of us like
 and none of us can refuse. It necessitates our taking a continued interest
 in the affairs of any of our poorer countrymen, so that we may anticipate
 their wants and see that none fall into poverty. There is an old proverb
 amongst us which says, 'The poor man's need is the rich man's shame?-'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, if I interrupt you for a moment. You allow that some, even of
 the Vril-ya, know want, and need relief."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If by want you mean the destitution that prevails in a Koom-Posh, THAT is
 impossible with us, unless an An has, by some extraordinary process, got
 rid of all his means, cannot or will not emigrate, and has either tired
 out the affectionate aid of this relations or personal friends, or refuses
 to accept it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, does he not supply the place of an infant or automaton, and
 become a labourer?a servant?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; then we regard him as an unfortunate person of unsound reason, and
 place him, at the expense of the State, in a public building, where every
 comfort and every luxury that can mitigate his affliction are lavished
 upon him. But an An does not like to be considered out of his mind, and
 therefore such cases occur so seldom that the public building I speak of
 is now a deserted ruin, and the last inmate of it was an An whom I
 recollect to have seen in my childhood. He did not seem conscious of loss
 of reason, and wrote glaubs (poetry). When I spoke of wants, I meant such
 wants as an An with desires larger than his means sometimes entertains?for
 expensive singing-birds, or bigger houses, or country-gardens; and the
 obvious way to satisfy such wants is to buy of him something that he
 sells. Hence Ana like myself, who are very rich, are obliged to buy a
 great many things they do not require, and live on a very large scale
 where they might prefer to live on a small one. For instance, the great
 size of my house in the town is a source of much trouble to my wife, and
 even to myself; but I am compelled to have it thus incommodiously large,
 because, as the richest An of the community, I am appointed to entertain
 the strangers from the other communities when they visit us, which they do
 in great crowds twice-a-year, when certain periodical entertainments are
 held, and when relations scattered throughout all the realms of the
 Vril-ya joyfully reunite for a time. This hospitality, on a scale so
 extensive, is not to my taste, and therefore I should have been happier
 had I been less rich. But we must all bear the lot assigned to us in this
 short passage through time that we call life. After all, what are a
 hundred years, more or less, to the ages through which we must pass
 hereafter? Luckily, I have one son who likes great wealth. It is a rare
 exception to the general rule, and I own I cannot myself understand it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After this conversation I sought to return to the subject which continued
 to weigh on my heart?viz., the chances of escape from Zee. But my
 host politely declined to renew that topic, and summoned our air-boat. On
 our way back we were met by Zee, who, having found us gone, on her return
 from the College of Sages, had unfurled her wings and flown in search of
 us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her grand, but to me unalluring, countenance brightened as she beheld me,
 and, poising herself beside the boat on her large outspread plumes, she
 said reproachfully to Aph-Lin?"Oh, father, was it right in you to
 hazard the life of your guest in a vehicle to which he is so unaccustomed?
 He might, by an incautious movement, fall over the side; and alas; he is
 not like us, he has no wings. It were death to him to fall. Dear one!"
 (she added, accosting my shrinking self in a softer voice), "have you no
 thought of me, that you should thus hazard a life which has become almost
 a part of mine? Never again be thus rash, unless I am thy companion. What
 terror thou hast stricken into me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I glanced furtively at Aph-Lin, expecting, at least, that he would
 indignantly reprove his daughter for expressions of anxiety and affection,
 which, under all the circumstances, would, in the world above ground, be
 considered immodest in the lips of a young female, addressed to a male not
 affianced to her, even if of the same rank as herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But so confirmed are the rights of females in that region, and so
 absolutely foremost among those rights do females claim the privilege of
 courtship, that Aph-Lin would no more have thought of reproving his virgin
 daughter than he would have thought of disobeying the orders of the Tur.
 In that country, custom, as he implied, is all in all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He answered mildly, "Zee, the Tish is in no danger and it is my belief the
 he can take very good care of himself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would rather that he let me charge myself with his care. Oh, heart of
 my heart, it was in the thought of thy danger that I first felt how much I
 loved thee!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Never did man feel in such a false position as I did. These words were
 spoken loud in the hearing of Zee's father?in the hearing of the
 child who steered. I blushed with shame for them, and for her, and could
 not help replying angrily: "Zee, either you mock me, which, as your
 father's guest, misbecomes you, or the words you utter are improper for a
 maiden Gy to address even to an An of her own race, if he has not wooed
 her with the consent of her parents. How much more improper to address
 them to a Tish, who has never presumed to solicit your affections, and who
 can never regard you with other sentiments than those of reverence and
 awe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aph-Lin made me a covert sing of approbation, but said nothing. "Be not so
 cruel!" exclaimed Zee, still in sonorous accents. "Can love command itself
 where it is truly felt? Do you suppose that a maiden Gy will conceal a
 sentiment that it elevates her to feel? What a country you must have come
 from!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here Aph-Lin gently interposed, saying, "Among the Tish-a the rights of
 your sex do not appear to be established, and at all events my guest may
 converse with you more freely if unchecked by the presence of others."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this remark Zee made no reply, but, darting on me a tender reproachful
 glance, agitated her wings and fled homeward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I had counted, at least, on some aid from my host," I said bitterly, "in
 the perils to which his own daughter exposes me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I gave you the best aid I could. To contradict a Gy in her love affairs
 is to confirm her purpose. She allows no counsel to come between her and
 her affections."
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter XXIV.
 </h2>
 <p>
 On alighting from the air-boat, a child accosted Aph-Lin in the hall with
 a request that he would be present at the funeral obsequies of a relation
 who had recently departed from that nether world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, I had never seen a burial-place or cemetery amongst this people, and,
 glad to seize even so melancholy an occasion to defer an encounter with
 Zee, I asked Aph-Lin if I might be permitted to witness with him the
 interment of his relation; unless, indeed, it were regarded as one of
 those sacred ceremonies to which a stranger to their race might not be
 admitted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The departure of an An to a happier world," answered my host, "when, as
 in the case of my kinsman, he has lived so long in this as to have lost
 pleasure in it, is rather a cheerful though quiet festival than a sacred
 ceremony, and you may accompany me if you will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Preceded by the child-messenger, we walked up the main street to a house
 at some little distance, and, entering the hall, were conducted to a room
 on the ground floor, where we found several persons assembled round a
 couch on which was laid the deceased. It was an old man, who had, as I was
 told, lived beyond his 130th year. To judge by the calm smile on his
 countenance, he had passed away without suffering. One of the sons, who
 was now the head of the family, and who seemed in vigorous middle life,
 though he was considerably more than seventy, stepped forward with a
 cheerful face and told Aph-Lin "that the day before he died his father had
 seen in a dream his departed Gy, and was eager to be reunited to her, and
 restored to youth beneath the nearer smile of the All-Good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While these two were talking, my attention was drawn to a dark metallic
 substance at the farther end of the room. It was about twenty feet in
 length, narrow in proportion, and all closed round, save, near the roof,
 there were small round holes through which might be seen a red light. From
 the interior emanated a rich and sweet perfume; and while I was
 conjecturing what purpose this machine was to serve, all the time-pieces
 in the town struck the hour with their solemn musical chime; and as that
 sound ceased, music of a more joyous character, but still of a joy subdued
 and tranquil, rang throughout the chamber, and from the walls beyond, in a
 choral peal. Symphonious with the melody, those in the room lifted their
 voices in chant. The words of this hymn were simple. They expressed no
 regret, no farewell, but rather a greeting to the new world whither the
 deceased had preceded the living. Indeed, in their language, the funeral
 hymn is called the 'Birth Song.' Then the corpse, covered by a long
 cerement, was tenderly lifted up by six of the nearest kinfolk and borne
 towards the dark thing I have described. I pressed forward to see what
 happened. A sliding door or panel at one end was lifted up?the body
 deposited within, on a shelf?the door reclosed?a spring a the
 side touched?a sudden 'whishing,' sighing sound heard from within;
 and lo! at the other end of the machine the lid fell down, and a small
 handful of smouldering dust dropped into a 'patera' placed to receive it.
 The son took up the 'patera' and said (in what I understood afterwards was
 the usual form of words), "Behold how great is the Maker! To this little
 dust He gave form and life and soul. It needs not this little dust for Him
 to renew form and life and soul to the beloved one we shall soon see
 again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each present bowed his head and pressed his hand to his heart. Then a
 young female child opened a small door within the wall, and I perceived,
 in the recess, shelves on which were placed many 'paterae' like that which
 the son held, save that they all had covers. With such a cover a Gy now
 approached the son, and placed it over the cup, on which it closed with a
 spring. On the lid were engraven the name of the deceased, and these
 words:?"Lent to us" (here the date of birth). "Recalled from us"
 (here the date of death).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The closed door shut with a musical sound, and all was over.

 "And this," said I, with my mind full of what I had witnessed?"this,
 I presume, is your usual form of burial?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Our invariable form," answered Aph-Lin. "What is it amongst your people?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We inter the body whole within the earth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! To degrade the form you have loved and honoured, the wife on whose
 breast you have slept, to the loathsomeness of corruption?" "But if the
 soul lives again, can it matter whether the body waste within the earth or
 is reduced by that awful mechanism, worked, no doubt by the agency of
 vril, into a pinch of dust?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You answer well," said my host, "and there is no arguing on a matter of
 feeling; but to me your custom is horrible and repulsive, and would serve
 to invest death with gloomy and hideous associations. It is something,
 too, to my mind, to be able to preserve the token of what has been our
 kinsman or friend within the abode in which we live. We thus feel more
 sensibly that he still lives, though not visibly so to us. But our
 sentiments in this, as in all things, are created by custom. Custom is not
 to be changed by a wise An, any more than it is changed by a wise
 Community, without the greatest deliberation, followed by the most earnest
 conviction. It is only thus that change ceases to be changeability, and
 once made is made for good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we regained the house, Aph-Lin summoned some of the children in his
 service and sent them round to several of his friends, requesting their
 attendance that day, during the Easy Hours, to a festival in honour of his
 kinsman's recall to the All-Good. This was the largest and gayest assembly
 I ever witnessed during my stay among the Ana, and was prolonged far into
 the Silent Hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The banquet was spread in a vast chamber reserved especially for grand
 occasions. This differed from our entertainments, and was not without a
 certain resemblance to those we read of in the luxurious age of the Roman
 empire. There was not one great table set out, but numerous small tables,
 each appropriated to eight guests. It is considered that beyond that
 number conversation languishes and friendship cools. The Ana never laugh
 loud, as I have before observed, but the cheerful ring of their voices at
 the various tables betokened gaiety of intercourse. As they have no
 stimulant drinks, and are temperate in food, though so choice and dainty,
 the banquet itself did not last long. The tables sank through the floor,
 and then came musical entertainments for those who liked them. Many,
 however, wandered away:?some of the younger ascended in their wings,
 for the hall was roofless, forming aerial dances; others strolled through
 the various apartments, examining the curiosities with which they were
 stored, or formed themselves into groups for various games, the favourite
 of which is a complicated kind of chess played by eight persons. I mixed
 with the crowd, but was prevented joining in the conversation by the
 constant companionship of one or the other of my host's sons, appointed to
 keep me from obtrusive questionings. The guests, however, noticed me but
 slightly; they had grown accustomed to my appearance, seeing me so often
 in the streets, and I had ceased to excite much curiosity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To my great delight Zee avoided me, and evidently sought to excite my
 jealousy by marked attentions to a very handsome young An, who (though, as
 is the modest custom of the males when addressed by females, he answered
 with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks, and was demure and shy as young
 ladies new to the world are in most civilised countries, except England
 and America) was evidently much charmed by the tall Gy, and ready to
 falter a bashful "Yes" if she had actually proposed. Fervently hoping that
 she would, and more and more averse to the idea of reduction to a cinder
 after I had seen the rapidity with which a human body can be hurried into
 a pinch of dust, I amused myself by watching the manners of the other
 young people. I had the satisfaction of observing that Zee was no singular
 assertor of a female's most valued rights. Wherever I turned my eyes, or
 lent my ears, it seemed to me that the Gy was the wooing party, and the An
 the coy and reluctant one. The pretty innocent airs which an An gave
 himself on being thus courted, the dexterity with which he evaded direct
 answers to professions of attachment, or turned into jest the flattering
 compliments addressed to him, would have done honour to the most
 accomplished coquette. Both my male chaperons were subjected greatly to
 these seductive influences, and both acquitted themselves with wonderful
 honour to their tact and self-control.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said to the elder son, who preferred mechanical employments to the
 management of a great property, and who was of an eminently philosophical
 temperament,?"I find it difficult to conceive how at your age, and
 with all the intoxicating effects on the senses, of music and lights and
 perfumes, you can be so cold to that impassioned young Gy who has just
 left you with tears in her eyes at your cruelty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young An replied with a sigh, "Gentle Tish, the greatest misfortune in
 life is to marry one Gy if you are in love with another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! You are in love with another?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas! Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she does not return your love?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. Sometimes a look, a tone, makes me hope so; but she has
 never plainly told me that she loves me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you not whispered in her own ear that you love her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fie! What are you thinking of? What world do you come from? Could I so
 betray the dignity of my sex? Could I be so un-Anly?so lost to
 shame, as to own love to a Gy who has not first owned hers to me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon: I was not quite aware that you pushed the modesty of your sex so
 far. But does no An ever say to a Gy, 'I love you,' till she says it first
 to him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't say that no An has ever done so, but if he ever does, he is
 disgraced in the eyes of the Ana, and secretly despised by the Gy-ei. No
 Gy, well brought up, would listen to him; she would consider that he
 audaciously infringed on the rights of her sex, while outraging the
 modesty which dignifies his own. It is very provoking," continued the An,
 "for she whom I love has certainly courted no one else, and I cannot but
 think she likes me. Sometimes I suspect that she does not court me because
 she fears I would ask some unreasonable settlement as to the surrender of
 her rights. But if so, she cannot really love me, for where a Gy really
 loves she forgoes all rights."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is this young Gy present?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh yes. She sits yonder talking to my mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I looked in the direction to which my eyes were thus guided, and saw a Gy
 dressed in robes of bright red, which among this people is a sign that a
 Gy as yet prefers a single state. She wears gray, a neutral tint, to
 indicate that she is looking about for a spouse; dark purple if she wishes
 to intimate that she has made a choice; purple and orange when she is
 betrothed or married; light blue when she is divorced or a widow, and
 would marry again. Light blue is of course seldom seen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Among a people where all are of so high a type of beauty, it is difficult
 to single out one as peculiarly handsome. My young friend's choice seemed
 to me to possess the average of good looks; but there was an expression in
 her face that pleased me more than did the faces of the young Gy-ei
 generally, because it looked less bold?less conscious of female
 rights. I observed that, while she talked to Bra, she glanced, from time
 to time, sidelong at my young friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Courage," said I, "that young Gy loves you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, but if she shall not say so, how am I the better for her love?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your mother is aware of your attachment?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps so. I never owned it to her. It would be un-Anly to confide such
 weakness to a mother. I have told my father; he may have told it again to
 his wife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you permit me to quit you for a moment and glide behind your mother
 and your beloved? I am sure they are talking about you. Do not hesitate. I
 promise that I will not allow myself to be questioned till I rejoin you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young An pressed his hand on his heart, touched me lightly on the
 head, and allowed me to quit his side. I stole unobserved behind his
 mother and his beloved. I overheard their talk. Bra was speaking; said
 she, "There can be no doubt of this: either my son, who is of marriageable
 age, will be decoyed into marriage with one of his many suitors, or he
 will join those who emigrate to a distance and we shall see him no more.
 If you really care for him, my dear Lo, you should propose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do care for him, Bra; but I doubt if I could really ever win his
 affections. He is fond of his inventions and timepieces; and I am not like
 Zee, but so dull that I fear I could not enter into his favourite
 pursuits, and then he would get tired of me, and at the end of three years
 divorce me, and I could never marry another?never."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not necessary to know about timepieces to know how to be so
 necessary to the happiness of an An, who cares for timepieces, that he
 would rather give up the timepieces than divorce his Gy. You see, my dear
 Lo," continued Bra, "that precisely because we are the stronger sex, we
 rule the other provided we never show our strength. If you were superior
 to my son in making timepieces and automata, you should, as his wife,
 always let him suppose you thought him superior in that art to yourself.
 The An tacitly allows the pre-eminence of the Gy in all except his own
 special pursuit. But if she either excels him in that, or affects not to
 admire him for his proficiency in it, he will not love her very long;
 perhaps he may even divorce her. But where a Gy really loves, she soon
 learns to love all that the An does."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young Gy made no answer to this address. She looked down musingly,
 then a smile crept over her lips, and she rose, still silent, and went
 through the crowd till she paused by the young An who loved her. I
 followed her steps, but discreetly stood at a little distance while I
 watched them. Somewhat to my surprise, till I recollected the coy tactics
 among the Ana, the lover seemed to receive her advances with an air of
 indifference. He even moved away, but she pursued his steps, and, a little
 time after, both spread their wings and vanished amid the luminous space
 above.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then I was accosted by the chief magistrate, who mingled with the
 crowd distinguished by no signs of deference or homage. It so happened
 that I had not seen this great dignitary since the day I had entered his
 dominions, and recalling Aph-Lin's words as to his terrible doubt whether
 or not I should be dissected, a shudder crept over me at the sight of his
 tranquil countenance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hear much of you, stranger, from my son Taee," said the Tur, laying his
 hand politely on my bended head. "He is very fond of your society, and I
 trust you are not displeased with the customs of our people."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I muttered some unintelligible answer, which I intended to be an assurance
 of my gratitude for the kindness I had received from the Tur, and my
 admiration of his countrymen, but the dissecting-knife gleamed before my
 mind's eye and choked my utterance. A softer voice said, "My brother's
 friend must be dear to me." And looking up I saw a young Gy, who might be
 sixteen years old, standing beside the magistrate and gazing at me with a
 very benignant countenance. She had not come to her full growth, and was
 scarcely taller than myself (viz., about feet 10 inches), and, thanks to
 that comparatively diminutive stature, I thought her the loveliest Gy I
 had hitherto seen. I suppose something in my eyes revealed that
 impression, for her countenance grew yet more benignant. "Taee tells me,"
 she said, "that you have not yet learned to accustom yourself to wings.
 That grieves me, for I should have liked to fly with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas!" I replied, "I can never hope to enjoy that happiness. I am assured
 by Zee that the safe use of wings is a hereditary gift, and it would take
 generations before one of my race could poise himself in the air like a
 bird." "Let not that thought vex you too much," replied this amiable
 Princess, "for, after all, there must come a day when Zee and myself must
 resign our wings forever. Perhaps when that day comes we might be glad if
 the An we chose was also without wings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Tur had left us, and was lost amongst the crowd. I began to feel at
 ease with Taee's charming sister, and rather startled her by the boldness
 of my compliment in replying, "that no An she could choose would ever use
 his wings to fly away from her." It is so against custom for an An to say
 such civil things to a Gy till she has declared her passion for him, and
 been accepted as his betrothed, that the young maiden stood quite
 dumbfounded for a few moments. Nevertheless she did not seem displeased.
 At last recovering herself, she invited me to accompany her into one of
 the less crowded rooms and listen to the songs of the birds. I followed
 her steps as she glided before me, and she led me into a chamber almost
 deserted. A fountain of naphtha was playing in the centre of the room;
 round it were ranged soft divans, and the walls of the room were open on
 one side to an aviary in which the birds were chanting their artful
 chorus. The Gy seated herself on one of the divans, and I placed myself at
 her side. "Taee tells me," she said, "that Aph-Lin has made it the law* of
 his house that you are not to be questioned as to the country you come
 from or the reason why you visit us. Is it so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 * Literally "has said, In this house be it requested." Words synonymous
 with law, as implying forcible obligation, are avoided by this singular
 people. Even had it been decreed by the Tur that his College of Sages
 should dissect me, the decree would have ran blandly thus,?"Be it
 requested that, for the good of the community, the carnivorous Tish be
 requested to submit himself to dissection."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "May I, at least, without sinning against that law, ask at least if the
 Gy-ei in your country are of the same pale colour as yourself, and no
 taller?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not think, O beautiful Gy, that I infringe the law of Aph-Lin, which
 is more binding on myself than any one, if I answer questions so innocent.
 The Gy-ei in my country are much fairer of hue than I am, and their
 average height is at least a head shorter than mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They cannot then be so strong as the Ana amongst you? But I suppose their
 superior vril force makes up for such extraordinary disadvantage of size?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They do not profess the vril force as you know it. But still they are
 very powerful in my country, and an An has small chance of a happy life if
 he be not more or less governed by his Gy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You speak feelingly," said Taee's sister, in a tone of voice half sad,
 half petulant. "You are married, of course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?certainly not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor betrothed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor betrothed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it possible that no Gy has proposed to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In my country the Gy does not propose; the An speaks first."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a strange reversal of the laws of nature!" said the maiden, "and
 what want of modesty in your sex! But have you never proposed, never loved
 one Gy more than another?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I felt embarrassed by these ingenious questionings, and said, "Pardon me,
 but I think we are beginning to infringe upon Aph-Lin's injunction. This
 much only will I answer, and then, I implore you, ask no more. I did once
 feel the preference you speak of; I did propose, and the Gy would
 willingly have accepted me, but her parents refused their consent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Parents! Do you mean seriously to tell me that parents can interfere with
 the choice of their daughters?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed they can, and do very often."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should not like to live in that country," said the Gy simply; "but I
 hope you will never go back to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I bowed my head in silence. The Gy gently raised my face with her right
 hand, and looked into it tenderly. "Stay with us," she said; "stay with
 us, and be loved." What I might have answered, what dangers of becoming a
 cinder I might have encountered, I still trouble to think, when the light
 of the naphtha fountain was obscured by the shadow of wings; and Zee,
 flying though the open roof, alighted beside us. She said not a word, but,
 taking my arm with her mighty hand, she drew me away, as a mother draws a
 naughty child, and led me through the apartments to one of the corridors,
 on which, by the mechanism they generally prefer to stairs, we ascended to
 my own room. This gained, Zee breathed on my forehead, touched my breast
 with her staff, and I was instantly plunged into a profound sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I awoke some hours later, and heard the songs of the birds in the
 adjoining aviary, the remembrance of Taee's sister, her gentle looks and
 caressing words, vividly returned to me; and so impossible is it for one
 born and reared in our upper world's state of society to divest himself of
 ideas dictated by vanity and ambition, that I found myself instinctively
 building proud castles in the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tish though I be," thus ran my meditations?"Tish though I be, it is
 then clear that Zee is not the only Gy whom my appearance can captivate.
 Evidently I am loved by A PRINCESS, the first maiden of this land, the
 daughter of the absolute Monarch whose autocracy they so idly seek to
 disguise by the republican title of chief magistrate. But for the sudden
 swoop of that horrible Zee, this Royal Lady would have formally proposed
 to me; and though it may be very well for Aph-Lin, who is only a
 subordinate minister, a mere Commissioner of Light, to threaten me with
 destruction if I accept his daughter's hand, yet a Sovereign, whose word
 is law, could compel the community to abrogate any custom that forbids
 intermarriage with one of a strange race, and which in itself is a
 contradiction to their boasted equality of ranks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not to be supposed that his daughter, who spoke with such
 incredulous scorn of the interference of parents, would not have
 sufficient influence with her Royal Father to save me from the combustion
 to which Aph-Lin would condemn my form. And if I were exalted by such an
 alliance, who knows but what the Monarch might elect me as his successor?
 Why not? Few among this indolent race of philosophers like the burden of
 such greatness. All might be pleased to see the supreme power lodged in
 the hands of an accomplished stranger who has experience of other and
 livelier forms of existence; and once chosen, what reforms I would
 institute! What additions to the really pleasant but too monotonous life
 of this realm my familiarity with the civilised nations above ground would
 effect! I am fond of the sports of the field. Next to war, is not the
 chase a king's pastime? In what varieties of strange game does this nether
 world abound? How interesting to strike down creatures that were known
 above ground before the Deluge! But how? By that terrible vril, in which,
 from want of hereditary transmission, I could never be a proficient? No,
 but by a civilised handy breech-loader, which these ingenious mechanicians
 could not only make, but no doubt improve; nay, surely I saw one in the
 Museum. Indeed, as absolute king, I should discountenance vril altogether,
 except in cases of war. Apropos of war, it is perfectly absurd to stint a
 people so intelligent, so rich, so well armed, to a petty limit of
 territory sufficing for 10,000 or 12,000 families. Is not this restriction
 a mere philosophical crotchet, at variance with the aspiring element in
 human nature, such as has been partially, and with complete failure, tried
 in the upper world by the late Mr. Robert Owen? Of course one would not go
 to war with the neighbouring nations as well armed as one's own subjects;
 but then, what of those regions inhabited by races unacquainted with vril,
 and apparently resembling, in their democratic institutions, my American
 countrymen? One might invade them without offence to the vril nations, our
 allies, appropriate their territories, extending, perhaps, to the most
 distant regions of the nether earth, and thus rule over an empire in which
 the sun never sets. (I forgot, in my enthusiasm, that over those regions
 there was no sun to set). As for the fantastical notion against conceding
 fame or renown to an eminent individual, because, forsooth, bestowal of
 honours insures contest in the pursuit of them, stimulates angry passions,
 and mars the felicity of peace?it is opposed to the very elements,
 not only of the human, but of the brute creation, which are all, if
 tamable, participators in the sentiment of praise and emulation. What
 renown would be given to a king who thus extended his empire! I should be
 deemed a demigod." Thinking of that, the other fanatical notion of
 regulating this life by reference to one which, no doubt, we Christians
 firmly believe in, but never take into consideration, I resolved that
 enlightened philosophy compelled me to abolish a heathen religion so
 superstitiously at variance with modern thought and practical action.
 Musing over these various projects, I felt how much I should have liked at
 that moment to brighten my wits by a good glass of whiskey-and-water. Not
 that I am habitually a spirit-drinker, but certainly there are times when
 a little stimulant of alcoholic nature, taken with a cigar, enlivens the
 imagination. Yes; certainly among these herbs and fruits there would be a
 liquid from which one could extract a pleasant vinous alcohol; and with a
 steak cut off one of those elks (ah! what offence to science to reject the
 animal food which our first medical men agree in recommending to the
 gastric juices of mankind!) one would certainly pass a more exhilarating
 hour of repast. Then, too, instead of those antiquated dramas performed by
 childish amateurs, certainly, when I am king, I will introduce our modern
 opera and a 'corps de ballet,' for which one might find, among the nations
 I shall conquer, young females of less formidable height and thews than
 the Gy-ei?not armed with vril, and not insisting upon one's marrying
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was so completely rapt in these and similar reforms, political, social,
 and moral, calculated to bestow on the people of the nether world the
 blessings of a civilisation known to the races of the upper, that I did
 not perceive that Zee had entered the chamber till I heard a deep sigh,
 and, raising my eyes, beheld her standing by my couch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I need not say that, according to the manners of this people, a Gy can,
 without indecorum, visit an An in his chamber, although an An would be
 considered forward and immodest to the last degree if he entered the
 chamber of a Gy without previously obtaining her permission to do so.
 Fortunately I was in the full habiliments I had worn when Zee had
 deposited me on the couch. Nevertheless I felt much irritated, as well as
 shocked, by her visit, and asked in a rude tone what she wanted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Speak gently, beloved one, I entreat you," said she, "for I am very
 unhappy. I have not slept since we parted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A due sense of your shameful conduct to me as your father's guest might
 well suffice to banish sleep from your eyelids. Where was the affection
 you pretend to have for me, where was even that politeness on which the
 Vril-ya pride themselves, when, taking advantage alike of that physical
 strength in which your sex, in this extraordinary region, excels our own,
 and of those detestable and unhallowed powers which the agencies of vril
 invest in your eyes and finger-ends, you exposed me to humiliation before
 your assembled visitors, before Her Royal Highness?I mean, the
 daughter of your own chief magistrate,?carrying me off to bed like a
 naughty infant, and plunging me into sleep, without asking my consent?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ungrateful! Do you reproach me for the evidences of my love? Can you
 think that, even if unstung by the jealousy which attends upon love till
 it fades away in blissful trust when we know that the heart we have wooed
 is won, I could be indifferent to the perils to which the audacious
 overtures of that silly little child might expose you?" "Hold! Since you
 introduce the subject of perils, it perhaps does not misbecome me to say
 that my most imminent perils come from yourself, or at least would come if
 I believed in your love and accepted your addresses. Your father has told
 me plainly that in that case I should be consumed into a cinder with as
 little compunction as if I were the reptile whom Taee blasted into ashes
 with the flash of his wand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not let that fear chill your heart to me," exclaimed Zee, dropping on
 her knees and absorbing my right hand in the space of her ample palm. "It
 is true, indeed, that we two cannot wed as those of the same race wed;
 true that the love between us must be pure as that which, in our belief,
 exists between lovers who reunite in the new life beyond that boundary at
 which the old life ends. But is it not happiness enough to be together,
 wedded in mind and in heart? Listen: I have just left my father. He
 consents to our union on those terms. I have sufficient influence with the
 College of Sages to insure their request to the Tur not to interfere with
 the free choice of a Gy; provided that her wedding with one of another
 race be but the wedding of souls. Oh, think you that true love needs
 ignoble union? It is not that I yearn only to be by your side in this
 life, to be part and parcel of your joys and sorrows here: I ask here for
 a tie which will bind us for ever and for ever in the world of immortals.
 Do you reject me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she spoke, she knelt, and the whole character of her face was changed;
 nothing of sternness left to its grandeur; a divine light, as that of an
 immortal, shining out from its human beauty. But she rather awed me as an
 angel than moved me as a woman, and after an embarrassed pause, I faltered
 forth evasive expressions of gratitude, and sought, as delicately as I
 could, to point out how humiliating would be my position amongst her race
 in the light of a husband who might never be permitted the name of father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," said Zee, "this community does not constitute the whole world. No;
 nor do all the populations comprised in the league of the Vril-ya. For thy
 sake I will renounce my country and my people. We will fly together to
 some region where thou shalt be safe. I am strong enough to bear thee on
 my wings across the deserts that intervene. I am skilled enough to cleave
 open, amidst the rocks, valleys in which to build our home. Solitude and a
 hut with thee would be to me society and the universe. Or wouldst thou
 return to thine own world, above the surface of this, exposed to the
 uncertain seasons, and lit but by the changeful orbs which constitute by
 thy description the fickle character of those savage regions? I so, speak
 the word, and I will force the way for thy return, so that I am thy
 companion there, though, there as here, but partner of thy soul, and
 fellow traveller with thee to the world in which there is no parting and
 no death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could not but be deeply affected by the tenderness, at once so pure and
 so impassioned, with which these words were uttered, and in a voice that
 would have rendered musical the roughest sounds in the rudest tongue. And
 for a moment it did occur to me that I might avail myself of Zee's agency
 to effect a safe and speedy return to the upper world. But a very brief
 space for reflection sufficed to show me how dishonourable and base a
 return for such devotion it would be to allure thus away, from her own
 people and a home in which I had been so hospitably treated, a creature to
 whom our world would be so abhorrent, and for whose barren, if spiritual
 love, I could not reconcile myself to renounce the more human affection of
 mates less exalted above my erring self. With this sentiment of duty
 towards the Gy combined another of duty towards the whole race I belonged
 to. Could I venture to introduce into the upper world a being so
 formidably gifted?a being that with a movement of her staff could in
 less than an hour reduce New York and its glorious Koom-Posh into a pinch
 of snuff? Rob her of her staff, with her science she could easily
 construct another; and with the deadly lightnings that armed the slender
 engine her whole frame was charged. If thus dangerous to the cities and
 populations of the whole upper earth, could she be a safe companion to
 myself in case her affection should be subjected to change or embittered
 by jealousy? These thoughts, which it takes so many words to express,
 passed rapidly through my brain and decided my answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Zee," I said, in the softest tones I could command and pressing
 respectful lips on the hand into whose clasp mine vanished?"Zee, I
 can find no words to say how deeply I am touched, and how highly I am
 honoured, by a love so disinterested and self-immolating. My best return
 to it is perfect frankness. Each nation has its customs. The customs of
 yours do not allow you to wed me; the customs of mine are equally opposed
 to such a union between those of races so widely differing. On the other
 hand, though not deficient in courage among my own people, or amid dangers
 with which I am familiar, I cannot, without a shudder of horror, think of
 constructing a bridal home in the heart of some dismal chaos, with all the
 elements of nature, fire and water, and mephitic gases, at war with each
 other, and with the probability that at some moment, while you were busied
 in cleaving rocks or conveying vril into lamps, I should be devoured by a
 krek which your operations disturbed from its hiding-place. I, a mere
 Tish, do not deserve the love of a Gy, so brilliant, so learned, so potent
 as yourself. Yes, I do not deserve that love, for I cannot return it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zee released my hand, rose to her feet, and turned her face away to hide
 her emotions; then she glided noiselessly along the room, and paused at
 the threshold. Suddenly, impelled as by a new thought, she returned to my
 side and said, in a whispered tone,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You told me you would speak with perfect frankness. With perfect
 frankness, then, answer me this question. If you cannot love me, do you
 love another?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly, I do not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do not love Taee's sister?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never saw her before last night." "That is no answer. Love is swifter
 than vril. You hesitate to tell me. Do not think it is only jealousy that
 prompts me to caution you. If the Tur's daughter should declare love to
 you?if in her ignorance she confides to her father any preference
 that may justify his belief that she will woo you, he will have no option
 but to request your immediate destruction, as he is specially charged with
 the duty of consulting the good of the community, which could not allow
 the daughter of the Vril-ya to wed a son of the Tish-a, in that sense of
 marriage which does not confine itself to union of the souls. Alas! there
 would then be for you no escape. She has no strength of wing to uphold you
 through the air; she has no science wherewith to make a home in the
 wilderness. Believe that here my friendship speaks, and that my jealousy
 is silent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With these words Zee left me. And recalling those words, I thought no more
 of succeeding to the throne of the Vril-ya, or of the political, social,
 and moral reforms I should institute in the capacity of Absolute
 Sovereign.

 <h2>
 Chapter XXVI.
 </h2>
 <p>
 After the conversation with Zee just recorded, I fell into a profound
 melancholy. The curious interest with which I had hitherto examined the
 life and habits of this marvellous community was at an end. I could not
 banish from my mind the consciousness that I was among a people who,
 however kind and courteous, could destroy me at any moment without scruple
 or compunction. The virtuous and peaceful life of the people which, while
 new to me, had seemed so holy a contrast to the contentions, the passions,
 the vices of the upper world, now began to oppress me with a sense of
 dulness and monotony. Even the serene tranquility of the lustrous air
 preyed on my spirits. I longed for a change, even to winter, or storm, or
 darkness. I began to feel that, whatever our dreams of perfectibility, our
 restless aspirations towards a better, and higher, and calmer, sphere of
 being, we, the mortals of the upper world, are not trained or fitted to
 enjoy for long the very happiness of which we dream or to which we aspire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, in this social state of the Vril-ya, it was singular to mark how it
 contrived to unite and to harmonise into one system nearly all the objects
 which the various philosophers of the upper world have placed before human
 hopes as the ideals of a Utopian future. It was a state in which war, with
 all its calamities, was deemed impossible,?a state in which the
 freedom of all and each was secured to the uttermost degree, without one
 of those animosities which make freedom in the upper world depend on the
 perpetual strife of hostile parties. Here the corruption which debases
 democracies was as unknown as the discontents which undermine the thrones
 of monarchies. Equality here was not a name; it was a reality. Riches were
 not persecuted, because they were not envied. Here those problems
 connected with the labours of a working class, hitherto insoluble above
 ground, and above ground conducing to such bitterness between classes,
 were solved by a process the simplest,?a distinct and separate
 working class was dispensed with altogether. Mechanical inventions,
 constructed on the principles that baffled my research to ascertain,
 worked by an agency infinitely more powerful and infinitely more easy of
 management than aught we have yet extracted from electricity or steam,
 with the aid of children whose strength was never overtasked, but who
 loved their employment as sport and pastime, sufficed to create a
 Public-wealth so devoted to the general use that not a grumbler was ever
 heard of. The vices that rot our cities here had no footing. Amusements
 abounded, but they were all innocent. No merry-makings conduced to
 intoxication, to riot, to disease. Love existed, and was ardent in
 pursuit, but its object, once secured, was faithful. The adulterer, the
 profligate, the harlot, were phenomena so unknown in this commonwealth,
 that even to find the words by which they were designated one would have
 had to search throughout an obsolete literature composed thousands of
 years before. They who have been students of theoretical philosophies
 above ground, know that all these strange departures from civilised life
 do but realise ideas which have been broached, canvassed, ridiculed,
 contested for; sometimes partially tried, and still put forth in fantastic
 books, but have never come to practical result. Nor were these all the
 steps towards theoretical perfectibility which this community had made. It
 had been the sober belief of Descartes that the life of man could be
 prolonged, not, indeed, on this earth, to eternal duration, but to what he
 called the age of the patriarchs, and modestly defined to be from 100 to
 150 years average length. Well, even this dream of sages was here
 fulfilled?nay, more than fulfilled; for the vigour of middle life
 was preserved even after the term of a century was passed. With this
 longevity was combined a greater blessing than itself?that of
 continuous health. Such diseases as befell the race were removed with ease
 by scientific applications of that agency?life-giving as
 life-destroying?which is inherent in vril. Even this idea is not
 unknown above ground, though it has generally been confined to enthusiasts
 or charlatans, and emanates from confused notions about mesmerism, odic
 force, &amp;c. Passing by such trivial contrivances as wings, which every
 schoolboy knows has been tried and found wanting, from the mythical or
 pre-historical period, I proceed to that very delicate question, urged of
 late as essential to the perfect happiness of our human species by the two
 most disturbing and potential influences on upper-ground society,?Womankind
 and Philosophy. I mean, the Rights of Women.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, it is allowed by jurisprudists that it is idle to talk of rights
 where there are not corresponding powers to enforce them; and above
 ground, for some reason or other, man, in his physical force, in the use
 of weapons offensive and defensive, when it come to positive personal
 contest, can, as a rule of general application, master women. But among
 this people there can be no doubt about the rights of women, because, as I
 have before said, the Gy, physically speaking, is bigger and stronger than
 the An; and her will being also more resolute than his, and will being
 essential to the direction of the vril force, she can bring to bear upon
 him, more potently than he on herself, the mystical agency which art can
 extract from the occult properties of nature. Therefore all that our
 female philosophers above ground contend for as to rights of women, is
 conceded as a matter of course in this happy commonwealth. Besides such
 physical powers, the Gy-ei have (at least in youth) a keen desire for
 accomplishments and learning which exceeds that of the male; and thus they
 are the scholars, the professors?the learned portion, in short, of
 the community.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of course, in this state of society the female establishes, as I have
 shown, her most valued privilege, that of choosing and courting her
 wedding partner. Without that privilege she would despise all the others.
 Now, above ground, we should not unreasonably apprehend that a female,
 thus potent and thus privileged, when she had fairly hunted us down and
 married us, would be very imperious and tyrannical. Not so with the Gy-ei:
 once married, the wings once suspended, and more amiable, complacent,
 docile mates, more sympathetic, more sinking their loftier capacities into
 the study of their husbands' comparatively frivolous tastes and whims, no
 poet could conceive in his visions of conjugal bliss. Lastly, among the
 more important characteristics of the Vril-ya, as distinguished from our
 mankind?lastly, and most important on the bearings of their life and
 the peace of their commonwealths, is their universal agreement in the
 existence of a merciful beneficent Diety, and of a future world to the
 duration of which a century or two are moments too brief to waste upon
 thoughts of fame and power and avarice; while with that agreement is
 combined another?viz., since they can know nothing as to the nature
 of that Diety beyond the fact of His supreme goodness, nor of that future
 world beyond the fact of its felicitous existence, so their reason forbids
 all angry disputes on insoluble questions. Thus they secure for that state
 in the bowels of the earth what no community ever secured under the light
 of the stars?all the blessings and consolations of a religion
 without any of the evils and calamities which are engendered by strife
 between one religion and another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It would be, then, utterly impossible to deny that the state of existence
 among the Vril-ya is thus, as a whole, immeasurably more felicitous than
 that of super-terrestrial races, and, realising the dreams of our most
 sanguine philanthropists, almost approaches to a poet's conception of some
 angelical order. And yet, if you would take a thousand of the best and
 most philosophical of human beings you could find in London, Paris,
 Berlin, New York, or even Boston, and place them as citizens in the
 beatified community, my belief is, that in less than a year they would
 either die of ennui, or attempt some revolution by which they would
 militate against the good of the community, and be burnt into cinders at
 the request of the Tur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Certainly I have no desire to insinuate, through the medium of this
 narrative, any ignorant disparagement of the race to which I belong. I
 have, on the contrary, endeavoured to make it clear that the principles
 which regulate the social system of the Vril-ya forbid them to produce
 those individual examples of human greatness which adorn the annals of the
 upper world. Where there are no wars there can be no Hannibal, no
 Washington, no Jackson, no Sheridan;?where states are so happy that
 they fear no danger and desire no change, they cannot give birth to a
 Demosthenes, a Webster, a Sumner, a Wendell Holmes, or a Butler; and where
 a society attains to a moral standard, in which there are no crimes and no
 sorrows from which tragedy can extract its aliment of pity and sorrow, no
 salient vices or follies on which comedy can lavish its mirthful satire,
 it has lost the chance of producing a Shakespeare, or a Moliere, or a Mrs.
 Beecher-Stowe. But if I have no desire to disparage my fellow-men above
 ground in showing how much the motives that impel the energies and
 ambition of individuals in a society of contest and struggle?become
 dormant or annulled in a society which aims at securing for the aggregate
 the calm and innocent felicity which we presume to be the lot of beatified
 immortals; neither, on the other hand, have I the wish to represent the
 commonwealths of the Vril-ya as an ideal form of political society, to the
 attainment of which our own efforts of reform should be directed. On the
 contrary, it is because we have so combined, throughout the series of
 ages, the elements which compose human character, that it would be utterly
 impossible for us to adopt the modes of life, or to reconcile our passions
 to the modes of thought among the Vril-ya,?that I arrived at the
 conviction that this people?though originally not only of our human
 race, but, as seems to me clear by the roots of their language, descended
 from the same ancestors as the Great Aryan family, from which in varied
 streams has flowed the dominant civilisation of the world; and having,
 according to their myths and their history, passed through phases of
 society familiar to ourselves,?had yet now developed into a distinct
 species with which it was impossible that any community in the upper world
 could amalgamate: and that if they ever emerged from these nether recesses
 into the light of day, they would, according to their own traditional
 persuasions of their ultimate destiny, destroy and replace our existent
 varieties of man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It may, indeed, be said, since more than one Gy could be found to conceive
 a partiality for so ordinary a type of our super-terrestrial race as
 myself, that even if the Vril-ya did appear above ground, we might be
 saved from extermination by intermixture of race. But this is too sanguine
 a belief. Instances of such 'mesalliance' would be as rare as those of
 intermarriage between the Anglo-Saxon emigrants and the Red Indians. Nor
 would time be allowed for the operation of familiar intercourse. The
 Vril-ya, on emerging, induced by the charm of a sunlit heaven to form
 their settlements above ground, would commence at once the work of
 destruction, seize upon the territories already cultivated, and clear off,
 without scruple, all the inhabitants who resisted that invasion. And
 considering their contempt for the institutions of Koom-Posh or Popular
 Government, and the pugnacious valour of my beloved countrymen, I believe
 that if the Vril-ya first appeared in free America?as, being the
 choicest portion of the habitable earth, they would doubtless be induced
 to do?and said, "This quarter of the globe we take; Citizens of a
 Koom-Posh, make way for the development of species in the Vril-ya," my
 brave compatriots would show fight, and not a soul of them would be left
 in this life, to rally round the Stars and Stripes, at the end of a week.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I now saw but little of Zee, save at meals, when the family assembled, and
 she was then reserved and silent. My apprehensions of danger from an
 affection I had so little encouraged or deserved, therefore, now faded
 away, but my dejection continued to increase. I pined for escape to the
 upper world, but I racked my brains in vain for any means to effect it. I
 was never permitted to wander forth alone, so that I could not even visit
 the spot on which I had alighted, and see if it were possible to reascend
 to the mine. Nor even in the Silent Hours, when the household was locked
 in sleep, could I have let myself down from the lofty floor in which my
 apartment was placed. I knew not how to command the automata who stood
 mockingly at my beck beside the wall, nor could I ascertain the springs by
 which were set in movement the platforms that supplied the place of
 stairs. The knowledge how to avail myself of these contrivances had been
 purposely withheld from me. Oh, that I could but have learned the use of
 wings, so freely here at the service of every infant, then I might have
 escaped from the casement, regained the rocks, and buoyed myself aloft
 through the chasm of which the perpendicular sides forbade place for human
 footing!

 <h2>
 Chapter XXVII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 One day, as I sat alone and brooding in my chamber, Taee flew in at the
 open window and alighted on the couch beside me. I was always pleased with
 the visits of a child, in whose society, if humbled, I was less eclipsed
 than in that of Ana who had completed their education and matured their
 understanding. And as I was permitted to wander forth with him for my
 companion, and as I longed to revisit the spot in which I had descended
 into the nether world, I hastened to ask him if he were at leisure for a
 stroll beyond the streets of the city. His countenance seemed to me graver
 than usual as he replied, "I came hither on purpose to invite you forth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We soon found ourselves in the street, and had not got far from the house
 when we encountered five or six young Gy-ei, who were returning from the
 fields with baskets full of flowers, and chanting a song in chorus as they
 walked. A young Gy sings more often than she talks. They stopped on seeing
 us, accosting Taee with familiar kindness, and me with the courteous
 gallantry which distinguishes the Gy-ei in their manner towards our weaker
 sex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And here I may observe that, though a virgin Gy is so frank in her
 courtship to the individual she favours, there is nothing that approaches
 to that general breadth and loudness of manner which those young ladies of
 the Anglo-Saxon race, to whom the distinguished epithet of 'fast' is
 accorded, exhibit towards young gentlemen whom they do not profess to
 love. No; the bearing of the Gy-ei towards males in ordinary is very much
 that of high-bred men in the gallant societies of the upper world towards
 ladies whom they respect but do not woo; deferential, complimentary,
 exquisitely polished?what we should call 'chivalrous.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Certainly I was a little put out by the number of civil things addressed
 to my 'amour propre,' which were said to me by those courteous young
 Gy-ei. In the world I came from, a man would have thought himself
 aggrieved, treated with irony, 'chaffed' (if so vulgar a slang word may be
 allowed on the authority of the popular novelists who use it so freely),
 when one fair Gy complimented me on the freshness of my complexion,
 another on the choice of colours in my dress, a third, with a sly smile,
 on the conquests I had made at Aph-Lin's entertainment. But I knew already
 that all such language was what the French call 'banal,' and did but
 express in the female mouth, below earth, that sort of desire to pass for
 amiable with the opposite sex which, above earth, arbitrary custom and
 hereditary transmission demonstrate by the mouth of the male. And just as
 a high-bred young lady, above earth, habituated to such compliments, feels
 that she cannot, without impropriety, return them, nor evince any great
 satisfaction at receiving them; so I who had learned polite manners at the
 house of so wealthy and dignified a Minister of that nation, could but
 smile and try to look pretty in bashfully disclaiming the compliments
 showered upon me. While we were thus talking, Taee's sister, it seems, had
 seen us from the upper rooms of the Royal Palace at the entrance of the
 town, and, precipitating herself on her wings, alighted in the midst of
 the group.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Singling me out, she said, though still with the inimitable deference of
 manner which I have called 'chivalrous,' yet not without a certain
 abruptness of tone which, as addressed to the weaker sex, Sir Philip
 Sydney might have termed 'rustic,' "Why do you never come to see us?"
 While I was deliberating on the right answer to give to this unlooked-for
 question, Taee said quickly and sternly, "Sister, you forget?the
 stranger is of my sex. It is not for persons of my sex, having due regard
 for reputation and modesty, to lower themselves by running after the
 society of yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This speech was received with evident approval by the young Gy-ei in
 general; but Taee's sister looked greatly abashed. Poor thing!?and a
 PRINCESS too!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just at this moment a shadow fell on the space between me and the group;
 and, turning round, I beheld the chief magistrate coming close upon us,
 with the silent and stately pace peculiar to the Vril-ya. At the sight of
 his countenance, the same terror which had seized me when I first beheld
 it returned. On that brow, in those eyes, there was that same indefinable
 something which marked the being of a race fatal to our own?that
 strange expression of serene exemption from our common cares and passions,
 of conscious superior power, compassionate and inflexible as that of a
 judge who pronounces doom. I shivered, and, inclining low, pressed the arm
 of my child-friend, and drew him onward silently. The Tur placed himself
 before our path, regarded me for a moment without speaking, then turned
 his eye quietly on his daughter's face, and, with a grave salutation to
 her and the other Gy-ei, went through the midst of the group,?still
 without a word.

 <h2>
 Chapter XXVIII.
 </h2>
 <p>
 When Taee and I found ourselves alone on the broad road that lay between
 the city and the chasm through which I had descended into this region
 beneath the light of the stars and sun, I said under my breath, "Child and
 friend, there is a look in your father's face which appals me. I feel as
 if, in its awful tranquillity, I gazed upon death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taee did not immediately reply. He seemed agitated, and as if debating
 with himself by what words to soften some unwelcome intelligence. At last
 he said, "None of the Vril-ya fear death: do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The dread of death is implanted in the breasts of the race to which I
 belong. We can conquer it at the call of duty, of honour, of love. We can
 die for a truth, for a native land, for those who are dearer to us than
 ourselves. But if death do really threaten me now and here, where are such
 counteractions to the natural instinct which invests with awe and terror
 the contemplation of severance between soul and body?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taee looked surprised, but there was great tenderness in his voice as he
 replied, "I will tell my father what you say. I will entreat him to spare
 your life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He has, then, already decreed to destroy it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Tis my sister's fault or folly," said Taee, with some petulance. "But
 she spoke this morning to my father; and, after she had spoken, he
 summoned me, as a chief among the children who are commissioned to destroy
 such lives as threaten the community, and he said to me, 'Take thy vril
 staff, and seek the stranger who has made himself dear to thee. Be his end
 painless and prompt.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And," I faltered, recoiling from the child?"and it is, then, for my
 murder that thus treacherously thou hast invited me forth? No, I cannot
 believe it. I cannot think thee guilty of such a crime."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is no crime to slay those who threaten the good of the community; it
 would be a crime to slay the smallest insect that cannot harm us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you mean that I threaten the good of the community because your sister
 honours me with the sort of preference which a child may feel for a
 strange plaything, it is not necessary to kill me. Let me return to the
 people I have left, and by the chasm through which I descended. With a
 slight help from you I might do so now. You, by the aid of your wings,
 could fasten to the rocky ledge within the chasm the cord that you found,
 and have no doubt preserved. Do but that; assist me but to the spot from
 which I alighted, and I vanish from your world for ever, and as surely as
 if I were among the dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The chasm through which you descended! Look round; we stand now on the
 very place where it yawned. What see you? Only solid rock. The chasm was
 closed, by the orders of Aph-Lin, as soon as communication between him and
 yourself was established in your trance, and he learned from your own lips
 the nature of the world from which you came. Do you not remember when Zee
 bade me not question you as to yourself or your race? On quitting you that
 day, Aph-Lin accosted me, and said, 'No path between the stranger's home
 and ours should be left unclosed, or the sorrow and evil of his home may
 descend to ours. Take with thee the children of thy band, smite the sides
 of the cavern with your vril staves till the fall of their fragments fills
 up every chink through which a gleam of our lamps could force its way.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As the child spoke, I stared aghast at the blind rocks before me. Huge and
 irregular, the granite masses, showing by charred discolouration where
 they had been shattered, rose from footing to roof-top; not a cranny!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All hope, then, is gone," I murmured, sinking down on the craggy wayside,
 "and I shall nevermore see the sun." I covered my face with my hands, and
 prayed to Him whose presence I had so often forgotten when the heavens had
 declared His handiwork. I felt His presence in the depths of the nether
 earth, and amidst the world of the grave. I looked up, taking comfort and
 courage from my prayers, and, gazing with a quiet smile into the face of
 the child, said, "Now, if thou must slay me, strike."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taee shook his head gently. "Nay," he said, "my father's request is not so
 formally made as to leave me no choice. I will speak with him, and may
 prevail to save thee. Strange that thou shouldst have that fear of death
 which we thought was only the instinct of the inferior creatures, to whom
 the convictions of another life has not been vouchsafed. With us, not an
 infant knows such a fear. Tell me, my dear Tish," he continued after a
 little pause, "would it reconcile thee more to departure from this form of
 life to that form which lies on the other side of the moment called
 'death,' did I share thy journey? If so, I will ask my father whether it
 be allowable for me to go with thee. I am one of our generation destined
 to emigrate, when of age for it, to some regions unknown within this
 world. I would just as soon emigrate now to regions unknown, in another
 world. The All-Good is no less there than here. Where is he not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Child," said I, seeing by Taee's countenance that he spoke in serious
 earnest, "it is crime in thee to slay me; it were a crime not less in me
 to say, 'Slay thyself.' The All-Good chooses His own time to give us life,
 and his own time to take it away. Let us go back. If, on speaking with thy
 father, he decides on my death, give me the longest warning in thy power,
 so that I may pass the interval in self-preparation."

 <h2>
 Chapter XXIX.
 </h2>
 <p>
 In the midst of those hours set apart for sleep and constituting the night
 of the Vril-ya, I was awakened from the disturbed slumber into which I had
 not long fallen, by a hand on my shoulder. I started and beheld Zee
 standing beside me. "Hush," she said in a whisper; "let no one hear us.
 Dost thou think that I have ceased to watch over thy safety because I
 could not win thy love? I have seen Taee. He has not prevailed with his
 father, who had meanwhile conferred with the three sages who, in doubtful
 matters, he takes into council, and by their advice he has ordained thee
 to perish when the world re-awakens to life. I will save thee. Rise and
 dress."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zee pointed to a table by the couch on which I saw the clothes I had worn
 on quitting the upper world, and which I had exchanged subsequently for
 the more picturesque garments of the Vril-ya. The young Gy then moved
 towards the casement and stepped into the balcony, while hastily and
 wonderingly I donned my own habiliments. When I joined her on the balcony,
 her face was pale and rigid. Taking me by the hand, she said softly, "See
 how brightly the art of the Vril-ya has lighted up the world in which they
 dwell. To-morrow the world will be dark to me." She drew me back into the
 room without waiting for my answer, thence into the corridor, from which
 we descended into the hall. We passed into the deserted streets and along
 the broad upward road which wound beneath the rocks. Here, where there is
 neither day nor night, the Silent Hours are unutterably solemn?the
 vast space illumined by mortal skill is so wholly without the sight and
 stir of mortal life. Soft as were our footsteps, their sounds vexed the
 ear, as out of harmony with the universal repose. I was aware in my own
 mind, though Zee said it not, that she had decided to assist my return to
 the upper world, and that we were bound towards the place from which I had
 descended. Her silence infected me and commanded mine. And now we
 approached the chasm. It had been re-opened; not presenting, indeed, the
 same aspect as when I had emerged from it, but through that closed wall of
 rock before which I had last stood with Taee, a new clift had been riven,
 and along its blackened sides still glimmered sparks and smouldered
 embers. My upward gaze could not, however, penetrate more than a few feet
 into the darkness of the hollow void, and I stood dismayed, and wondering
 how that grim ascent was to be made.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Zee divined my doubt. "Fear not," said she, with a faint smile; "your
 return is assured. I began this work when the Silent Hours commenced, and
 all else were asleep; believe that I did not paused till the path back
 into thy world was clear. I shall be with thee a little while yet. We do
 not part until thou sayest, 'Go, for I need thee no more.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My heart smote me with remorse at these words. "Ah!" I exclaimed, "would
 that thou wert of my race or I of thine, then I should never say, 'I need
 thee no more.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I bless thee for those words, and I shall remember them when thou art
 gone," answered the Gy, tenderly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During this brief interchange of words, Zee had turned away from me, her
 form bent and her head bowed over her breast. Now, she rose to the full
 height of her grand stature, and stood fronting me. While she had been
 thus averted from my gaze, she had lighted up the circlet that she wore
 round her brow, so that it blazed as if it were a crown of stars. Not only
 her face and her form, but the atmosphere around, were illumined by the
 effulgence of the diadem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," said she, "put thine arm around me for the first and last time.
 Nay, thus; courage, and cling firm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she spoke her form dilated, the vast wings expanded. Clinging to her, I
 was borne aloft through the terrible chasm. The starry light from her
 forehead shot around and before us through the darkness. Brightly and
 steadfastly, and swiftly as an angel may soar heavenward with the soul it
 rescues from the grave, went the flight of the Gy, till I heard in the
 distance the hum of human voices, the sounds of human toil. We halted on
 the flooring of one of the galleries of the mine, and beyond, in the
 vista, burned the dim, feeble lamps of the miners. Then I released my
 hold. The Gy kissed me on my forehead, passionately, but as with a
 mother's passion, and said, as the tears gushed from her eyes, "Farewell
 for ever. Thou wilt not let me go into thy world?thou canst never
 return to mine. Ere our household shake off slumber, the rocks will have
 again closed over the chasm not to be re-opened by me, nor perhaps by
 others, for ages yet unguessed. Think of me sometimes, and with kindness.
 When I reach the life that lies beyond this speck in time, I shall look
 round for thee. Even there, the world consigned to thyself and thy people
 may have rocks and gulfs which divide it from that in which I rejoin those
 of my race that have gone before, and I may be powerless to cleave way to
 regain thee as I have cloven way to lose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her voice ceased. I heard the swan-like sough of her wings, and saw the
 rays of her starry diadem receding far and farther through the gloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I sate myself down for some time, musing sorrowfully; then I rose and took
 my way with slow footsteps towards the place in which I heard the sounds
 of men. The miners I encountered were strange to me, of another nation
 than my own. They turned to look at me with some surprise, but finding
 that I could not answer their brief questions in their own language, they
 returned to their work and suffered me to pass on unmolested. In fine, I
 regained the mouth of the mine, little troubled by other interrogatories;?save
 those of a friendly official to whom I was known, and luckily he was too
 busy to talk much with me. I took care not to return to my former lodging,
 but hastened that very day to quit a neighbourhood where I could not long
 have escaped inquiries to which I could have given no satisfactory
 answers. I regained in safety my own country, in which I have been long
 peacefully settled, and engaged in practical business, till I retired on a
 competent fortune, three years ago. I have been little invited and little
 tempted to talk of the rovings and adventures of my youth. Somewhat
 disappointed, as most men are, in matters connected with household love
 and domestic life, I often think of the young Gy as I sit alone at night,
 and wonder how I could have rejected such a love, no matter what dangers
 attended it, or by what conditions it was restricted. Only, the more I
 think of a people calmly developing, in regions excluded from our sight
 and deemed uninhabitable by our sages, powers surpassing our most
 disciplined modes of force, and virtues to which our life, social and
 political, becomes antagonistic in proportion as our civilisation
 advances,?the more devoutly I pray that ages may yet elapse before
 there emerge into sunlight our inevitable destroyers. Being, however,
 frankly told by my physician that I am afflicted by a complaint which,
 though it gives little pain and no perceptible notice of its
 encroachments, may at any moment be fatal, I have thought it my duty to my
 fellow-men to place on record these forewarnings of The Coming Race.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
