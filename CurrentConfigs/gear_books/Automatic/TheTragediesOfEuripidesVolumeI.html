<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

 <p>The translations of the first six plays in the present volume were
 published at Oxford some years since, and have been frequently reprinted.
 They are now carefully revised according to Dindorf's text, and are
 accompanied by a few additional notes adapted to the requirements of the
 student.</p><br>

 <p>The translations of the Bacch?, Heraclid?, and the two Iphigenias, are
 based upon the same text, with certain exceptions, which are pointed out
 at the foot of the page. The annotations on the Iphigenias are almost
 exclusively critical, as it is presumed that a student who proceeds to
 the reading of these somewhat difficult plays<sup>[1]</sup>, will be sufficiently advanced in his
 acquaintance with the Greek drama to dispense with more elementary
 information.</p><br>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="short">

 <p>Euripides, son of Mnesarchus, was born in the island of Salamis, on
 the day of the celebrated victory (B.C. 480). His mother, Clito, had been
 sent thither in company with the other Athenian women, when Attica was
 given up, and the ships became at once the refuge of the male population,
 and the national defense. Mr. Donaldson<sup>[1]</sup> well remarks, that the patronymic form
 of his name, derived from the Euripus, which was the scene of the first
 successful resistance offered to the Persian navy, shows that the
 attention of his parents was fully excited by the stirring events of the
 time.</p><br>

 <p>Notwithstanding the fact that his mother had been an herb-seller, it
 is probable that his father was a man of some family. That he was at
 least possessed of ample means, is evident from the care and expense
 bestowed upon our poet's education. Under the tutorship of Anaxagoras,
 Prodicus, and Protagoras, he had studied both natural philosophy and
 rhetoric in its sophistical form. In gymnastic exercises he exhibited a
 successful prowess, being twice victorious in the Eleusinian and Thesean
 games. Of his skill in painting, some specimens were preserved at
 Megara.</p><br>

 <p>His appearance as a dramatist was at an earlier age than that of his
 predecessors, as he was only five and twenty years old when he produced
 the "Peliades," his first tragedy. On this occasion, he gained the third
 prize in the tragic contests, but the first, fourteen years after, and
 subsequently, with the "Hippolytus," in 428 B.C. The peculiar tendency of
 some of the ideas expressed in his plays, was the probable cause of the
 retirement of Euripides to Macedonia, where he obtained the friendship of
 King Archelaus. Perhaps, however, the unhappiness of his connubial state,
 arising from the infidelity of his two wives, might have rendered Athens
 a disagreeable place of abode for the woman-hating poet, especially when
 his "domestic bliss" was continually seasoned by the sarcastic jokes and
 allusions of his political enemy, Aristophanes. Moreover, his
 acquaintance with the talking philosopher, Socrates, must have been
 unfavorable to the continuance of his popularity.</p><br>

 <p>The fate of Pentheus in our author's noble play, the "Bacch?," appears
 to have given origin to the tradition that he himself was torn to pieces
 by dogs. If we reflect that this play was probably the last of his works,
 the mistake seems a plausible one. The death of Euripides, which probably
 happened in the ordinary course of nature, has, like that of ?schylus,
 been associated with the marvelous.</p><br>

 <p>The Athenians vainly craved the honor of giving a resting-place to the
 ashes of their philosopher-poet. He was buried at Pella, but a cenotaph
 at Athens showed that his countrymen had not forgotten Euripides. His
 death took place B.C. 406.</p><br>

 <p>The inferiority of our author to the greater tragedians, prevents our
 feeling much desire to enter upon the respective merits and demerits of
 his several plays, especially as we are completely anticipated by
 Schlegel, with whose masterly analysis every reader ought to be
 acquainted. Nevertheless, a few general remarks may, perhaps, be not
 wholly unprofitable.</p><br>

 <p>It has been truly remarked, that tragedy, in no small degree, owed its
 downfall to Euripides. Poetry was gradually superseded by rhetoric,
 sublimity by earnestness, pathos by reasoning. Thus, Iphigenia and
 Macaria give so many good reasons for dying, that the sacrifice appears
 very small, and a modern wag in the upper regions of the theatre would,
 at the end of the speech of the latter heroine, almost have exclaimed,
 "Then why don't you die?"</p><br>

 <p>It has been said, that our poet drew the characters of life as he
 found them, but bad as his characters are, they exhibit only a vulgar
 wickedness. Unable to portray a Clyt?mnestra, he revels in the continual
 paltriness of a Menelaus or Ulysses. As if he took a delight in the black
 side of humanity, he loves to show the strength of false reasoning, of
 sophistry antagonistic to truth, and of cold expediency in opposition to
 the natural feelings of humanity. From a similar reason, his occasional
 attempts at comedy degenerate into mere farce. We question whether the
 scene between Death and Apollo in the "Alcestis," could be surpassed in
 vulgarity, even by the modern school of English dramatists, while his
 exaggerations in the minor characters are scarcely to be surpassed by the
 lowest writer of any period.</p><br>

 <p>Under Euripides, the stage began gradually to approximate more closely
 to the ordinary and, at that time, debased character of Athenian society.
 A contempt for the Laced?monians, a passionate taste for the babbling and
 trickery of the forum, and an attempt to depreciate the social position
 and influence of the weaker sex, form the most unamiable features of this
 change. Yet we must allow, that if Euripides has reveled in the
 amiabilities of a Melanippe or a Ph?dra, in the gentle revenge of a Medea
 or Hecuba, he has at the same time given us an Alcestis, the only real
 example of genuine conjugal affection on the Greek stage.</p><br>

 <p>Nor must we forget that Euripides is a greater admirer of nature, a
 more complete delineator of her workings, than the two greater
 tragedians. He has more of illustrative philosophy, more of regard to the
 objects of the animated creation, the system of the universe, than his
 greater rivals exhibit. He is, as Vitruvius has justly styled him, a
 "stage-philosopher." Did we possess a larger acquaintance with the works
 of Parmenides, Empedocles, and other early cosmogonists, we should
 perhaps think less of his merits on this head: as it is, the possession
 of some such fragments of our poet makes us deeply regret the loss of the
 plays themselves.</p><br>

 <p>But his very love for the contemplation of nature has in no small
 degree contributed to the mischievous skepticism promulgated by our poet.
 In early times, when a rural theogony was the standard of belief, when
 each star had its deity, each deity its undisputed, unquestioned
 prerogative and worship, there was little inclination, less opportunity,
 for skepticism. Throughout the poetry of Hesiod, we find this feeling
 ever predominant, a feeling which Virgil and Tibullus well knew how to
 appreciate. Even Euripides himself, perhaps taught by some dangerous
 lessons at home, has expressed his belief that it is best "not to be too
 clever in matters regarding the Gods."<sup>[2]</sup> A calm retreat in the wild, picturesque
 tracts of Macedonia, might have had some share in reforming this spoiled
 pupil of the sophists. But as we find that the too careful contemplation
 of nature degenerates into superstition or rationalism in their various
 forms, so Euripides had imbibed the taste for saying startling things,<sup>[3]</sup> rather than wise;
 for reducing the principles of creation to materialism, the doctrines of
 right and wrong to expediency, and immutable truths to a popular system
 of question and answer. Like the generality of sophists, he took away a
 received truth, and left nothing to supply its place; he reasoned
 falsehood into probability, truth into nonentity.</p><br>

 <p>At a period when the Prodico-Socratic style of disputing was in high
 fashion, the popularity of Euripides must have been excessive. His
 familiar appeals to the trifling matters of ordinary life, his characters
 all philosophizing, from the prince to the dry-nurse, his excellent
 reasons for doing right or wrong, as the case might be, must have been
 inestimably delightful to the accommodating morals of the Athenians. The
 Court of Charles the Second could hardly have derived more pleasure from
 the writings of a Behn or a Hamilton, than these unworthy descendants of
 Codrus must have experienced in hearing a bad cause so cleverly defended.
 Whether the orators and dikasts followed the example of the stage in
 those days, can scarcely be ascertained, but it is more than certain that
 they practically illustrated its principles. At least, the Sicilians were
 so fond of our author, that a few of the unfortunate survivors of the
 Syracusan disaster, were enabled to pick up a living by quoting such
 passages of our author as they had learned by heart. A compliment paid to
 few living dramatists in our days!</p><br>

 <p>In dramatic conduct, Euripides is at an even greater disadvantage with
 ?schylus and Sophocles. The best characters of the piece are often the
 least employed, as in the instance of Macaria in the "Heraclid?," while
 the play is dwindled away with dull, heavy dirges, and the complaints of
 senile childishness. The chorus, as Aristotle<sup>[4]</sup> has remarked, is most unfortunately
 independent of the plot, although the finest poetry is generally to be
 found in the lyric portions of our author's plays. In fact, Euripides
 rather wanted management in employing his resources, than the resources
 themselves. An ear well attuned to the harmony of verse, a delicate
 perception of the graceful points of language, and a finished subtilty in
 touching the more minute feelings and impulses of the mind, were all
 thrown away either upon bad subjects or worse principles. There is no
 true tragedy in Euripides, He is a melodramatist, but not according to
 the modern acceptation. His plays might end either happily or the
 reverse. A deity conveniently brought in, the arrival of a messenger,
 however unexpectedly, together with a liberal allowance for a cowardly
 revenge upon the vanquished?these are the Euripidean elements for
 giving a tragic end to a play. Nay, so great is the prodigality of
 slaughter throughout his dramas, that we can but imagine morbid cruelty
 to have formed a considerable ingredient in the disposition of Euripides.
 Even his pathos is somewhat tinctured with this taste for painful images.
 As we have beheld in our own times a barbarian alternately glut his sight
 with executions, and then shed floods of tears, and sink into idiot
 despondency; so the poetry of Euripides in turn disgusts us with
 outrageous cruelty, and depresses us with the most painful demands upon
 our compassion.</p><br>

 <p>In the lyric portions of his dramas, our poet has been far more
 successful. The description of the capture of Troy by night,<sup>[5]</sup> is a splendid
 specimen of animation blended with true pathos. But taken as a whole.
 Euripides is a most unequal author. We may commence a play with pleasure
 (but O for the prologues!), we may proceed with satisfaction, but the
 feeling rarely lasts to the end. If I may venture an opinion upon so
 uncertain a subject, I should name the Hippolytus, Ion, Troades, Bacch?,
 and Iphigenia in Aulis as his best plays, placing the Ph?niss?,
 Alcestis, Medea, Hecuba, and Orestes in a lower rank. The Helena is an
 amusing heap of absurdities, and reads much better in the burlesque of
 Aristophanes; the Electra is utterly beneath criticism; the Cyclops a
 weak, but humorous imitation of Homer. The other plays appear to be
 neither bad nor good.</p><br>

 <p>The style of Euripides is, generally speaking, easy; and I can mention
 no author from whom a taste for elegant Greek and a facility in
 composition can more easily be derived. Some of his plays have suffered
 severely from the ravages of time, the ignorance of copyists, and the
 more dangerous officiousness of grammarians. Some passages of the Bacch?,
 Rhesus, Troades, and the two Iphigenias, despite the ingenuity and
 erudition of such scholars as Porson, Elmsley, Monk, Burges, and a host
 of others, must still remain mere matter for guessing. Hermann's
 Euripides is, as a whole, sadly unworthy the abilities of the Humboldt of
 Greek literature.</p><br>

 <p>The present volume contains the most popular of our author's works,
 according to present usage. But the spirit which is gradually infusing
 itself into the minds of those who are most actively engaged in the
 educational system of England, fully warrants a hope that Porson's "four
 plays" will shortly cease to be the boundaries of the student's
 acquaintance with Euripides.</p><br>

 <p>I need scarcely observe, that the study of Aristophanes is
 indissolubly connected with that of our author. If the reader discover
 the painful fact that the burlesque writer is greater than the tragedian,
 he will perhaps also recollect that such a literary relation is,
 unfortunately, by no means confined to the days of Aristophanes.</p><br>

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short">

 <p>After the capture of Troy, the Greeks put into the Chersonese over
 against Troas, But Achilles, having appeared by night, demanded one of
 the daughters of Priam to be slain. The Greeks therefore, in honor to
 their hero, tore Polyxena from Hecuba, and offered her up in sacrifice.
 Polymestor moreover, the king of the Thracians, murdered Polydore, a son
 of Priam's. Now Polymestor had received him from the hands of Priam as a
 charge to take care of, together with some money. But when the city was
 taken, wishing to seize upon his wealth, he determined to dispatch him,
 and disregarded the ill-fated friendship that subsisted between them; but
 his body being cast out into the sea, the wave threw him up on the shore
 before the tents of the captive women. Hecuba, on seeing the corse,
 recognized it; and having imparted her design to Agamemnon, sent for
 Polymestor to come to her with his sons, concealing what had happened,
 under pretense that she might discover to him some treasures hidden in
 Ilium. But on his arrival she slew his sons, and put out his eyes; but
 pleading her cause before the Greeks, she gained it over her accuser
 (Polymestor). For it was decided that she did not begin the cruelty, but
 only avenged herself on him who did begin it.</p><br>

<hr>

<h2>HECUBA.</h2>

<hr class="short">

<p class="center">GHOST OF POLYDORE.</p><br>

 <p>I am present, having left the secret dwellings of the dead and the
 gates of darkness, where Pluto has his abode apart from the other Gods,
 Polydore the son of Hecuba the daughter of Cisseus,<sup>[1]</sup> and Priam my sire, who when the danger
 of falling by the spear of Greece was threatening the city of the
 Phrygians, in fear, privately sent me from the Trojan land to the house
 of Polymestor, his Thracian friend, who cultivates the most fruitful soil
 of the Chersonese, ruling a warlike people with his spear.<sup>[2]</sup> But my father sends
 privately with me a large quantity of gold, in order that, if at any time
 the walls of Troy should fall, there might not be a lack of sustenance
 for his surviving children. But I was the youngest of the sons of Priam;
 on which account also he sent me privately from the land, for I was able
 neither to bear arms nor the spear with my youthful arm. As long then
 indeed as the landmarks of the country remained erect, and the towers of
 Troy were unshaken, and Hector my brother prevailed with his spear, I
 miserable increased vigorously as some young branch, by the nurture I
 received at the hands of the Thracian, my father's friend. But after that
 both Troy and the life of Hector were put an end to, and my father's
 mansions razed to the ground, and himself falls at the altar built by the
 God, slain by the blood-polluted son of Achilles, the friend of my father
 slays me, wretched man, for the sake of my gold, and having slain me
 threw me into the surf of the sea, that he might possess the gold himself
 in his palace. But I am exposed on the shore, at another time on the
 ocean's surge, borne about by many ebbings and flowings of the waves,
 unwept, unburied; but at present I am hastening on my dear mother's
 account, having left my body, borne aloft this day already the third,<sup>[3]</sup> for so long has my
 wretched mother been present in this territory of the Chersonese from
 Troy. But all the Grecians, holding their ships at anchor, are sitting
 quiet on the shores of this land of Thrace. For Achilles the son of
 Peleus, appearing above his tomb, stayed all the army of the Grecians as
 they were directing homeward their sea dipped oars; and asks to receive
 my sister Polyxena as a dear victim, and a tribute of honor to his tomb.
 And this he will obtain, nor will he be without this gift from his
 friends; and fate this day leads forth my sister to death. But my mother
 will see the two corses of her two children, both mine and the unhappy
 virgin's; for I shall appear on a breaker before the feet of a female
 slave, that I wretched may obtain sepulture; for I have successfully
 entreated those who have power beneath to find a tomb, and to fall into
 my mother's hands. As much then as I wish to have shall be mine; but I
 will withdraw myself out of the way of the aged Hecuba, for she is
 advancing her step beyond the tent of Agamemnon, dreading my phantom.
 Alas! O my mother, who, from kingly palaces, hast beheld the day of
 slavery, how unfortunate art thou now, in the degree that thou wert once
 fortunate! but some one of the Gods counterpoising your state, destroys
 you on account of your ancient prosperity.</p><br>

<p class="center">HECUBA. CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Lead onward, ye Trojan dames, the old woman before the tent; lead
 onward, raising up one now your fellow-slave, but once your queen; take
 me, bear me, conduct me, support my body, holding my aged hand; and I,
 leaning on the bending staff of my hand,<sup>[4]</sup> will hasten to put forward the slow
 motion of my joints. O lightning of Jove! O thou gloomy night! why, I
 pray, am I thus disquieted in the night with terrors, with phantoms? O
 thou venerable Earth, the mother of black-winged dreams, I renounce the
 nightly vision, which regarding my son who is preserved in Thrace, and
 regarding Polyxena my dear daughter, in my dreams have I beheld, a
 fearful sight, I have learned, I have understood. Gods of this land,
 preserve my son, who, my only son, and, [as it were,] the anchor of my
 house, inhabits the snowy Thrace under the protection of his father's
 friend. Some strange event will take place, some strain will come
 mournful to the mournful. Never did my mind so incessantly shudder and
 tremble. Where, I pray, ye Trojan dames, can I behold the divine spirit
 of Helenus, or Cassandra, that they may interpret my dreams? For I beheld
 a dappled hind torn by the blood-stained fang of the wolf, forcibly
 dragged from my bosom, a miserable sight. And dreadful this vision also;
 the spectre of Achilles came above the summit of his tomb, and demanded
 as a tribute of honor one of the wretched Trojan women. From my daughter
 then, from my daughter avert this fate, ye Gods, I implore you.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Hecuba, with haste to thee I flew, leaving the tents of our
 lords, where I was allotted and ordained a slave, driven from the city of
 Troy, led captive of the Greeks by the point of the spear, not to
 alleviate aught of your sufferings, but bringing a heavy weight of
 tidings, and to thee, O lady, a herald of woe. For it is said that it has
 been decreed in the full council of the Greeks to make thy daughter a
 sacrifice to Achilles: for you know how that having ascended o'er his
 tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships, as
 they were setting their sails with their halliards, exclaiming in these
 words; "Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!" Then the
 waves of great contention clashed together, and a divided opinion went
 forth through the army of the Greeks; to some it appeared advisable to
 give a victim to his tomb, and to others it appeared not. But Agamemnon
 was studious to advance your good, cherishing the love of the infuriated
 prophetess. But the two sons of Theseus, scions of Athens, were the
 proposers of different arguments, but in this one opinion they coincided,
 to crown the tomb of Achilles with fresh blood; and declared they would
 never prefer the bed of Cassandra before the spear of Achilles. And the
 strength of the arguments urged on either side was in a manner equal,
 till that subtle adviser, that babbling knave,<sup>[5]</sup> honeyed in speech, pleasing to the
 populace, that son of Laertes, persuades the army, not to reject the suit
 of the noblest of all the Greeks on account of a captive victim, and not
 to put it in the power of any of the dead standing near Proserpine to say
 that the Grecians departed from the plains of Troy ungrateful to the
 heroes who died for the state of Greece. And Ulysses will come only not
 now, to tear your child from your bosom, and to take her from your aged
 arms. But go to the temples, speed to the altars, sit a suppliant at the
 knees of Agamemnon, invoke the Gods, both those of heaven, and those
 under the earth; for either thy prayers will prevent thy being deprived
 of thy wretched daughter, or thou must behold the virgin falling before
 the tomb, dyed in blood gushing forth in a dark stream from her neck
 adorned with gold.<sup>[6]</sup></p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! wretched me! what shall I exclaim? what shriek shall I
 utter? what lamentation? miserable through miserable age, and slavery not
 to be endured, insupportable. Alas! who is there to defend me? what
 offspring, what city! The old man is gone. My children are gone. Whither
 shall I turn me? and whither shall I go? Where is any god or deity to
 succor me? O Trojan dames, bearers of evil tidings, bearers of woe, you
 have destroyed me utterly, you have destroyed me. Life in the light is no
 more desirable! O wretched foot, lead, lead an aged woman to this tent! O
 child, daughter of the most afflicted mother, come forth, come forth from
 the tent, hear thy mother's voice, that thou mayest know what a report I
 hear that concerns thy life.</p><br>

<p class="center">HECUBA, POLYXENA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. O mother, why dost thou call! proclaiming what new affliction
 hast thou frighted me from the tent, as some bird from its nest, with
 this alarm?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! my child!</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Why address me in words of ill omen? This is an evil
 prelude.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! for thy life.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Speak, conceal it no longer from me. I fear, I fear, my mother;
 why I pray dost thou groan?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O child, child of an unhappy mother!</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Why sayest thou this?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. My child, the common decree of the Greeks unites to slay thee at
 the tomb of the son of Peleus.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Alas, my mother! how are you relating unenviable ills? Tell me,
 tell me, my mother.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I declare, my child, the ill-omened report, they bring word that
 a decree has passed by the vote of the Greeks regarding thy life.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. O thou that hast borne affliction! O thou wretched on every
 side! O mother unhappy in your life, what most hated and most unutterable
 calamity has some destiny again sent against thee! This child is no
 longer thine; no longer indeed shall I miserable share slavery with
 miserable age. For as a mountain whelp or heifer shalt thou wretched
 behold me wretched torn from thine arms, and sent down beneath the
 darkness of the earth a victim to Pluto, where I shall lie bound in
 misery with the dead. But it is for thee indeed, my afflicted mother,
 that I lament in these mournful strains, but for my life, my wrongs, my
 fate, I mourn not; but death, a better lot, has befallen me.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. But see Ulysses advances with hasty step, to declare to thee,
 Hecuba, some new determination.</p><br>

<p class="center">ULYSSES, HECUBA, POLYXENA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Lady, I imagine that you are acquainted with the decree of the
 army, and the vote which has prevailed; nevertheless, I will declare it.
 It has been decreed by the Greeks to offer on the lofty mound of
 Achilles's tomb thy daughter Polyxena. But they order me to conduct and
 convey the damsel; but the son of Achilles is appointed to be the priest,
 and to preside over the rites. Do you know then what to do? Be not
 dragged away by violence, nor enter into a contest of strength with me,
 but acknowledge superior force and the presence of thy ills; it is wise
 to have proper sentiments even in adversity.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! alas! the great trial is at hand, as it seems, of
 lamentations full, nor without tears; for I have not died in the state in
 which I ought to have died, nor hath Jove destroyed me, but preserves me,
 that I wretched may behold other misfortunes greater than [past]
 misfortunes. But if it be allowed slaves to put questions to the free,
 not offensive nor grating to the feelings, it will be your part to be
 questioned, and ours who are asking to attend.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. You have permission, ask freely, I grudge not the time.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Dost thou remember when thou camest a spy on Troy, disfigured by
 a vile dress, and from thine eyes drops caused by the fear of death
 bedewed thy beard?</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. I remember well; for it made no slight impression on my
 heart.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. But Helen knew thee, and told me alone.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. I remember the great danger I encountered.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. And didst thou embrace my knees in thy humility?</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. So that my hand was numbered<sup>[7]</sup> through fear on thy garments.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. What then didst thou say, being then my slave?</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Many arguments that I invented to save me from death.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Did I preserve thee then, and conduct thee safe from the
 land?</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Yes, so that I now behold the light of the sun.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Art thou not then convicted of baseness by this conduct, who hast
 received benefits from me such as thou acknowledgest thou hast, and doest
 us no good in return, but evil, as far as in thee lies? Thankless is your
 race, as many of you as court honor from oratory before the populace; be
 ye not known to me, who care not to injure your friends, provided you say
 what is gratifying to the people. But plotting what dark design have they
 determined upon a decree of death against my child? Did fate impel them
 to offer human sacrifices at the tomb, where it were rather right to
 sacrifice cattle? Or does Achilles, desirous of devoting in his turn to
 death those that wrought his death, with a color of justice meditate her
 destruction? But she has done him no ill: he should demand Helen as a
 sacrifice on his tomb; for she destroyed him, and brought him to Troy.
 But if some captive selected from the rest, and excelling in beauty,
 ought to die, this is not ours. For the daughter of Tyndarus is most
 preeminent in beauty, and has been found to be no less injurious than us.
 On the score of justice then I urge this argument; but with respect to
 what you ought to repay at my demand, hear: thou hast touched my hand, as
 thou ownest, and this aged cheek also, falling at my knees. Thy hand and
 knees I in return grasp, and re-demand the favor I granted you then, and
 beseech you, do not tear my child from my arms, nor kill her; enough have
 died already. In her I rejoice, and forget my misfortunes; she serves as
 my consolation in the stead of many things, she is my city, my nurse, my
 staff, the guide of my way. It becomes not those who have power to
 exercise their power in things wherein they ought not, nor should the
 fortunate imagine their fortune will last forever. For I too have had my
 time of prosperity, but now have I ceased to be: one day wrenched from me
 all my happiness. But by thy beard which I supplicate, reverence me, pity
 me; go to the Grecian army, and remind them that it is a shameful thing
 to slay women whom ye have once spared, and that too dragging them from
 the altar. But show mercy. But the laws of blood among you are laid down
 alike for the free and the slave. But your worth will carry with it
 persuasion, although your arguments be bad; for the same words from those
 of little character, have not the same force as when they proceed from
 those of high reputation.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. There is no nature of man so obdurate, which on hearing thy
 groans, and thy long plaints of misery, would not let fall the tear.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Hecuba, be advised, nor through passion deem him thine enemy
 who gives thee good advice. I indeed am ready to preserve thy person
 through the means of which I was fortunate; and I say no other. But what
 I declared before all I will not deny, that, Troy being captured, we
 should give thy daughter as a victim to the noblest man of the army, who
 demands her; for in this many cities fail, when any man who is brave and
 zealous receives no more honor than those who are less valiant. But
 Achilles, O lady, is worthy of honor from us, a man who died most
 gloriously in behalf of the Grecian country. Were not then this
 disgraceful, if when living we treat him as a friend, but after he is
 gone we no longer treat him so? Well! what then will any one say, if
 there again should be an assembling of the army, and a contest with the
 enemy: "Shall we fight or preserve our lives, seeing that he who falls
 lies unhonored?" But for me at least, living from day to day, although I
 have but little, that little is sufficient; but I would wish that my
 monument should be beheld crowned with honor, for the gratification is
 for a long time. But if thou sayest thou sufferest affliction, hear this
 in return from me. There are with us aged matrons, and hoary sires, not
 less wretched than thou art, and brides bereft of the noblest husbands,
 whose ashes this land of Troy conceals. Endure this. But we, if we
 injudiciously determine to honor the brave man, shall incur the charge of
 folly. But you barbarians neither consider your friends as friends, nor
 do you hold up to admiration those who have died honorably; thus shall
 Greece be prosperous, but you shall experience fortune corresponding to
 your counsels.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! how wretched is the state of slavery, and to endure
 indignities compelled by superior force! (Note [B].)</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O daughter, my words respecting thy death are vanished in the
 air, set forth in vain; but thou, if thou hast greater powers [of
 persuasion] than thy mother, use all thy influence, uttering every note
 as the throat of the nightingale, that thou mayest not be deprived of
 life. But fall before the knees of Ulysses in all the eloquence of grief,
 and persuade him; thou hast a pretext, for he also hath children; so that
 he may be inclined to pity thy fortune.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. I see, Ulysses, that thou art hiding thy hand beneath thy robe,
 and turnest thy face away, that I may not touch thy beard. Be not afraid;
 thou hast avoided my suppliant Jove; for I will follow thee both on
 account of fate, and even wishing to die; but if I were not willing, I
 should appear base, and too fond of life. For wherefore should I live,
 whose father was monarch of all the Trojans; this my dawn of life. Then
 was I nurtured under fair hope, a bride for princes, having no small
 competition for my hand, to whose palace and hearth I should come. But I,
 wretched now, was mistress among the Trojan women, and conspicuous in the
 train of virgins, equal to goddesses, death only excepted. But now I am a
 slave; first of all the very name, not being familiar, persuades me to
 love death. Then perhaps I might meet with masters cruel in disposition,
 who will buy me for silver, the sister both of Hector and many other
 [heroes.] And imposing the task of making bread in his palace, will
 compel me, passing the day in misery, both to sweep the house, and stand
 at the loom. And some slave somewhere purchased will defile my bed,
 before wooed by princes. This never shall be. I will quit this light from
 mine eyes free, offering my body to Pluto. Lead on then, Ulysses, conduct
 me to death; for I see neither confidence of hope, nor of expectation,
 present to me that I can ever enjoy good fortune. But do thou, my mother,
 in no wise hinder me by your words or by your actions; but assent to my
 death before I meet with indignities unsuited to my rank. For one who has
 not been accustomed to taste misfortunes bears indeed, but grieves, to
 put his neck under the yoke. But he would be far more blessed in death
 than in life; for to live otherwise than honorably is a great burden.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. It is a great and distinguishing feature among men to be born of
 generous parents, and the name of nobility of birth among the
 illustrious, proceeds from great to greater still.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. You have spoken honorably, my daughter, but in that honorable
 dwells grief. But if the son of Peleus must be gratified, and you must
 escape blame, Ulysses, kill not her; but leading me to the pyre of
 Achilles, strike me, spare me not; I brought forth Paris, who destroyed
 the son of Thetis, having pierced him with his arrows.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. The phantom of Achilles did not demand that thou, O aged lady,
 but that thy daughter here should die.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Do thou then at least slay me with my daughter, and there will be
 twice the libation of blood for the earth, and the dead who makes this
 request.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Thy daughter's death suffices; one must not be heaped on
 another; would that we required not even this one.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. There is a strong necessity for me to die with my daughter.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. How so? for I am not aware of any master that I have.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. As the ivy the oak, so will I clasp her.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Not so; if you will take the advice of your superiors in
 knowledge.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Never will I willingly quit my child here.</p><br>

 <p>ULYSS. Nor will I leave this place without the virgin.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Mother, be persuaded; and thou, son of Laertes, be gentle to a
 parent with reason moved to anger. But thou, O wretched mother, contend
 not with conquerors. Dost thou wish to fall on the earth and to wound thy
 aged flesh dragged by violence, and to suffer the indignity of being torn
 by a youthful arm? which things you will suffer. Do not, I pray thee, for
 it is not seemly. But, my dear mother, give me thy beloved hand, and
 grant me to join cheek to cheek; since never hereafter, but now for the
 last time shall I behold the rays of the sun and his bright orb. Receive
 my last address, O mother! O thou that bearedst me, I am going below.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. And I, O daughter, shall be a slave in the light of day.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Without the bridegroom, without the bridal song, which I ought
 to have obtained.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Mournful thou, my child; but I am a wretched woman.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. There shall I lie in darkness far from thee.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas me, what shall I do? where end my life?</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. I shall die a slave, born of a free father.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. But I bereft indeed of fifty children.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. What message shall I bear to Hector, and to thy aged
 husband?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Tell them that I am most miserable of all women.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. O ye breasts that tenderly nursed me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O daughter of an untimely and unhappy fate.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Farewell, O mother, farewell Cassandra too.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Others farewell, but this is not for thy mother.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Farewell, my brother Polydore, among the warlike Thracians.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. If he lives at least: but I doubt, so unfortunate am I in every
 thing.</p><br>

 <p>POLTX. He lives, and shall close thy dying eye.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I am dead, before my death, beneath my ills.</p><br>

 <p>POLYX. Lead me, Ulysses, having covered my face with a veil, since,
 before I am sacrificed indeed, I am melted in heart at my mother's
 plaints, her also I melt by my lamentations. O light, for yet it is
 allowed me to express thy name, but I have no share in thee, except
 during the time that I am going between the sword and the pyre of
 Achilles.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Ah me! I faint; and my limbs fail me.?O daughter, touch thy
 mother, stretch forth thy hand?give it me?leave me not
 childless?I am lost, my friends. Would that I might see the Spartan
 Helen, the sister of the twin sons of Jove, thus, for through her bright
 eyes that most vile woman destroyed the happy Troy.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Gale, gale of the sea,<sup>[8]</sup> which waftest the swift barks bounding
 through the waves through the surge of the ocean, whither wilt thou bear
 me hapless? To whose mansion shall I come, a purchased slave? Or to the
 port of the Doric or Phthian shore, where they report that Apidanus, the
 most beautiful father of floods, enriches the plains? or wilt thou bear
 me hapless urged by the maritime oar, passing a life of misery in my
 prison-house, to that island<sup>[9]</sup> where both the first-born palm tree and
 the laurel shot forth their hallowed branches to their beloved Latona,
 emblem of the divine parturition? And with the Delian nymphs shall I
 celebrate in song the golden chaplet and bow of Diana? Or, in the
 Athenian city, shall I upon the saffron robe harness the steeds to the
 car of Minerva splendid in her chariot, representing them in embroidery
 upon the splendid looms of brilliant threads, or the race of Titans,
 which Jove the son of Saturn sends to eternal rest with his flaming
 lightning? Alas, my children! Alas, my ancestors, and my paternal land,
 which is overthrown, buried in smoke, captured by the Argive sword! but I
 indeed am<sup>[10]</sup> a
 slave in a foreign country, having left Asia the slave of Europe, having
 changed my bridal chamber for the grave.</p><br>

<p class="center">TALTHYBIUS, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>TAL. Tell me, ye Trojan dames, where can I find Hecuba, late the queen
 of Troy?</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Not far from thee, O Talthybius, she is lying stretched on the
 ground, muffled in her robes.</p><br>

 <p>TAL. O Jupiter, what shall I say? Shall I say that thou beholdest
 mortals? or that they have to no end or purpose entertained false
 notions, who suppose the existence of a race of Deities, and that fortune
 has the sovereign control over men? Was not this the queen of the opulent
 Phrygians? was not this the wife of the all-blest Priam? And now all her
 city is overthrown by the spear, but she a captive, aged, childless, lies
 on the ground defiling her ill-fated head with the dust. Alas! alas! I
 too am old, but rather may death be my portion before I am involved in
 any such debasing fortune; stand up, oh unhappy, raise thy side, and lift
 up thy hoary head.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Let me alone: who art thou that sufferest not my body to rest?
 why dost thou, whoever thou art, disturb me from my sadness?</p><br>

 <p>TAL. I am here, Talthybius, the herald of the Greeks, Agamemnon having
 sent me for thee, O lady.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Hast thou come then, thou dearest of men, it having been decreed
 by the Greeks to slay me too upon the tomb? Thou wouldest bring dear news
 indeed. Then haste we, let us speed with all our might: lead on, old
 man.</p><br>

 <p>TAL. I am here and come to thee, O lady, that thou mayest entomb thy
 dead daughter. Both the two sons of Atreus and the Grecian host send
 me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! what wilt thou say? Art thou not come for me as doomed to
 death, but to bring this cruel message? Thou art dead, my child, torn
 from thy mother; and I am childless as far as regards thee; oh! wretch
 that I am. But how did ye slay her? was it with becoming reverence? Or
 did ye proceed in your butchery as with an enemy, O old man? Tell me,
 though you will relate no pleasing tale.</p><br>

 <p>TAL. Twice, O lady, thou desirest me to indulge in tears through pity
 for thy daughter; for both now while relating the mournful circumstance
 shall I bedew this eye, as did I then at the tomb when she perished. The
 whole host of the Grecian army was present before the tomb, at the
 sacrifice of thy daughter. But the son of Achilles taking Polyxena by the
 hand, placed her on the summit of the mound; but I stood near him: and
 there followed a chosen band of illustrious youths in readiness to
 restrain with their hands thy daughter's struggles; then the son of
 Achilles took a full-crowned goblet of entire gold, and poured forth
 libations to his deceased father; and makes signal to me to proclaim
 silence through all the Grecian host. And I standing forth in the midst,
 thus spoke: "Be silent, O ye Greeks, let all the people remain silent;
 silence, be still:" and I made the people perfectly still. But he said,
 "O son of Peleus, O my father, accept these libations which have the
 power of soothing, and which speed the dead on their way; and come, that
 thou mayest drink the pure purple blood of this virgin, which both the
 army and myself offer unto thee; but be propitious to us, and grant us to
 weigh anchor, and to loose the cables of our ships, and to return each to
 his country, having met with a prosperous return from Troy." Thus much he
 said, and all the army joined in the prayer. Then taking by the hilt his
 sword decked with gold, he drew it from its scabbard, and made signs to
 the chosen youths of the Greeks to hold the virgin. But she, when she
 perceived it,<sup>[11]</sup>
 uttered this speech: "O Argives, ye that destroyed my city, I die
 willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword
 with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me,
 that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a
 queen, is what I am ashamed of." But the people murmured assent, and king
 Agamemnon ordered the young men to quit the virgin; [but they, soon as
 they heard the last words of him who had the seat of chief authority
 among them, let go their hold,] and she, on hearing this speech of her
 lords, took her robe, and rent it, beginning from the top of her shoulder
 down to her waist: and showed her breasts and bosom beauteous, as a
 statue's, and bending her knee on the ground, spoke words the most
 piteous ever heard, "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or
 wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared." But
 he at once resolved and unresolved through pity of the virgin, cuts with
 the sword the passage of her breath; and fountains of blood burst forth.
 But she, e'en in death, showed much care to fall decently, and to veil
 from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed. But after that she
 breathed forth her spirit under the fatal blow, not one of the Greeks
 exercised the same offices; but some scattered leaves from their hands on
 the dead; some heap the funeral pile, bringing whole trunks of pines: but
 he that would not bring, heard rebukes of this sort from him that was
 thus employed: "Standest thou idle, thou man of most mean spirit? Hast in
 thy hand no robe, no ornament for the maiden? Hast thou naught to give to
 her so exceeding brave in heart and most noble in soul?" These things I
 tell thee of the death of thy daughter, but I behold thee at once the
 most happy, at once the most unhappy of all women in thine offspring.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Dreadful calamities have risen fierce against the house of
 Priam; such the hard fate of the Gods.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O daughter! which of my ills I shall first attend to, amidst such
 a multitude, I know not: for if I touch on any, another does not suffer
 me; and thence again some fresh grief draws me aside, succeeding miseries
 upon miseries. And now I can not obliterate from my mind thy sufferings,
 so as not to bewail them: but excess of grief hast thou taken away,
 having been reported to me as noble. Is it then no paradox, if land
 indeed naturally bad, when blest with a favorable season from heaven,
 bears well the ear; but good land, robbed of the advantages it ought to
 have, brings forth bad fruit: but ever among men, the bad by nature is
 nothing else but bad; the good always good, nor under misfortune does he
 degenerate from his nature, but is the same good man? Is it, that the
 parents cause this difference, or the education? The being brought up
 nobly hath indeed in it the knowledge and principles of goodness; but if
 one is acquainted well with this, he knows what is vicious, having
 already learned it by the rule of virtue. And this indeed has my mind
 been ejaculating in vain. But do thou go, and signify these things to the
 Greeks, that no one be suffered to touch my daughter, but bid them keep
 off the multitude. In so vast an army the rabble are riotous, and the
 sailors' uncontrolled insolence is fiercer than fire; and he is evil, who
 does not evil. But do thou, my old attendant, taking an urn, fill it with
 sea water, and bring it hither, that I may wash my girl in her last bath,
 the bride no bride now, and the virgin no longer a virgin, wash her, and
 lay her out; according to her merits?whence can I? This I can not;
 but as I can, I will, for what can I do! And collecting ornaments from
 among the captured women, who dwell beside me in these tents, if any one,
 unobserved by our new lords, has by her any stolen memorial of her home.
 O state of my house, O mansions once happy! O Priam, of vast wealth
 possessed, and supremely blest in thine offspring, and I too, this aged
 woman, the mother of such children! How have we come to nothing, bereft
 of our former grandeur! And yet still forsooth we are elated, one of us
 in his gorgeous palaces; another, when honored among his citizens. These
 are nothing. In vain the counsels of the mind, and the tongue's boast. He
 is most blest, to whom from day to day no evil happens.</p><br>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>Against me was it fated that calamity, against me was it fated that
 woe should spring, when Paris first hewed the pine in Ida's forest,
 preparing to cut his way over the ocean surge to the bed of Helen, the
 fairest that the sun's golden beams shine upon. For toils, and fate more
 stern than toils, close us round: and from the folly of one came a public
 calamity fatal to the land of Simois, and woes springing from other woes:
 and when the dispute was decided, which the shepherd decided between the
 three daughters of the blessed Gods on Ida's top, for war, and slaughter,
 and the desolation of my palaces. And many a Spartan virgin at her home
 on the banks of the fair-flowing Eurotas sighs while bathed in tears: and
 many an aged matron strikes her hand against her hoary head, for her
 children who have perished, and tears her cheek making her nails all
 blood-stained with her wounds.</p><br>

<p class="center">FEMALE ATTENDANT, CHORUS, HECUBA.</p><br>

 thy messages of woe never rest.</p><br>

 right time for thy words.</p><br>

 express in words, thou art undone, and no longer beholdest the light,
 childless, husbandless, cityless, entirely destroyed.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Thou has said nothing new, but hast reproached me who already
 know it: but why dost thou bring this corse of my Polyxena, whose
 sepulture was reported to me as in a state of active progress through the
 labors of all the Grecians?</p><br>

 <p>ATT. She nothing knows, but, woe's me! laments Polyxena, nor does she
 apprehend her new misfortunes.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O wretched me! dost bring hither the body of the frantic and
 inspired Cassandra?</p><br>

 <p>ATT. She whom thou mentionedst, lives; but thou dost not weep for him
 who is dead; but behold this corse cast naked [on the shore,] and look if
 it will appear to thee a wonder, and what thou little expectest.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas me! I do indeed see my son Polydore a corse, whom (<i>I
 fondly hoped</i>) the man of Thrace was preserving in his palace. Now am
 I lost indeed, I no longer exist. Oh my child, my child! Alas! I begin
 the Bacchic strain, having lately learned my woes from my evil
 genius.</p><br>

 <p>ATT. Thou knowest then the calamity of thy son, O most
 unfortunate.</p><br>

 immeasurable woes follow one upon the other. No longer will a day without
 a tear, without a groan, have part with me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O child, child of a wretched mother, by what fate art thou dead,
 by what hap liest thou here? by the hand of what man?</p><br>

 <p>ATT. I know not: on the wave-washed shore I found him.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Cast up from the sea, or fallen by the blood-stained spear? (Note
 [C].)</p><br>

 <p>ATT. The ocean's billow cast him up from the deep on the smooth
 sand.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Woe is me! Now understand I the dream, the vision of mine eyes;
 the black-winged phantom has not flitted by me in vain, which I saw
 concerning thee, my child, as being no longer in the light of day.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. But who slew him? canst thou, O skilled in dreams, declare
 him?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. My friend, my friend, who curbs the steed in Thrace, where his
 aged father placed him for concealment.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Ah me! what wilt thou say? Was it to possess his gold that he
 slew him!</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Unutterable deeds, unworthy of a name, surpassing miracles,
 unhallowed, insufferable! Where are the laws of hospitality? O most
 accurst of men, how didst thou mar that skin, how sever with the cruel
 sword the poor limbs of this boy, nor didst feel pity?</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. O hapless woman, how has the deity made thee by far the most
 wretched of mortals, whoever he be that presses heavy on thee! But, my
 friends, let us henceforward be silent, for I see our lord Agamemnon
 advancing.</p><br>

<p class="center">AGAMEMNON, CHORUS, HECUBA.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Why, Hecuba, delayest thou to come, and bury thy girl in her
 tomb, agreeably to what Talthybius told me, that no one of the Argives
 should be suffered to touch thy daughter. For our part we leave her
 alone, and touch her not; but thou art slow, whereat I am astonished. I
 am come therefore to fetch thee, for every thing there has been well and
 duly performed, if aught of well there be in this. Ah! what corse is this
 I see before the tent? some Trojan's too? for that it is no Grecian's,
 the robes that vest his limbs inform me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) Thou ill-starr'd wretch! myself I mean, when I say
 "thou." O Hecuba, what shall I do? Shall I fall at the knees of Agamemnon
 here, or bear my ills in silence?</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Why dost lament turning thy back upon me, and sayest not what has
 happened? Who is this?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) But should he, thinking me a slave, an enemy,
 spurn me from his knees, I should be adding to my present sufferings.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. No prophet I, so as to trace, unless by hearing, the path of thy
 counsels.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) Am I not rather then putting an evil construction
 on this man's thoughts, whereas he has no evil intention toward me?</p><br>

 <p>AGA. If thou art willing that I should nothing of this affair, thou
 art of a mind with me, for neither do I wish to hear.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) I can not without him take vengeance for my
 children. Why do I thus hesitate? I must be bold, whether I succeed, or
 fail. Agamemnon, by these knees, and by thy beard I implore thee, and by
 thy blessed hand?</p><br>

 <p>AGA. What thy request? Is it to pass thy life in freedom? for this is
 easy for thee to obtain.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Not this indeed; but so that I avenge myself on the bad, I am
 willing to pass my whole life in slavery.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. And for what assistance dost thou call on me?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. In none of those things which thou imaginest, O king. Seest thou
 this corse, o'er which I drop the tear?</p><br>

 <p>AGA. I see it; thy meaning however I can not learn from this.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Him did I once bring forth, him bore I in my bosom.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Is this indeed one of thy children, O unhappy woman?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. It is, but not of the sons of Priam who fell under the walls of
 Troy.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Didst thou then bear any other besides those, O lady?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. In vain, as it appears, this whom you see.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. But where did he chance to be, when the city fell?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. His father sent him out of the country, dreading his death.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Whither, having removed him alone of his children then alive?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. To this country, where he was found a corse.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. To him who is king over this state, to Polymestor?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Hither was he sent, the guardian of gold, which proved most
 destructive to him.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. By whose hand then he is dead, and having met with what fate?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. By whom else should he? The Thracian host slew him.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. O wretch! was he so inflamed with the desire of obtaining the
 gold?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Even so, after he had heard of Troy's disasters.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. And where didst thou find him, or who brought the body?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. She, meeting with it on the sea-shore.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. In quest of it, or occupied in some other employment?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. She was going to bring from the sea wherewith to bathe
 Polyxena.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. This friend then, as it seems, murdered him, and after that cast
 him out.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. To toss upon the waves thus gashing his body.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. O thou unhappy from thy unmeasured ills!</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I perish, no woe is left, O Agamemnon.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Alas! alas! What woman was ever so unfortunate?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. There is none, except you reckon Misfortune herself. But for what
 cause I fall at thy knees, now hear: if I appear to you to suffer these
 ills justly, I would be reconciled to them; but if otherwise, be thou my
 avenger on this man, this most impious of false friends; who revering
 neither the Gods beneath<sup>[12]</sup> the earth, nor the Gods above, hath
 done this most unholy deed, having often partaken of the same table with
 me, [and in the list of hospitality the first of my friends; and having
 met with whatever was due,<sup>[13]</sup> and having received a full
 consideration for his services,<sup>[14]</sup>] slew him, and deigned not to give
 him a tomb, <i>which he might have given</i>, although he purposed to
 slay him, but cast him forth at the mercy of the waves. We indeed are
 slaves, and perhaps weak; but the Gods are strong, and strong the law,
 which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we
 live having justice and injustice strictly defined; which if when
 referred to thee it be disregarded, and they shall suffer no punishment
 who slay their guests, or dare to pollute the hallowed statutes of the
 Gods, there is nothing equitable in the dealings of men. Beholding these
 things then in a base and proper light, reverence me; pity me, and, as
 the artist stands aside <i>to view a picture</i>, do thou view my living
 portrait, and see what woes I am enduring. Once was I a queen, but now I
 am thy slave; once was I blest in my children, but now aged, and at the
 same time childless, cityless, destitute, the most miserable of mortals.
 Alas me wretched! whither withdrawest from me thy foot? It seems<sup>[15]</sup> I shall make no
 impression, wretch that I am. Why then do we mortals toil after all other
 sciences, as a matter of duty, and dive into them, but least of all
 strive to learn thoroughly Persuasion, the sole mistress o'er the minds
 of men, giving a price for her knowledge, that at some time we may have
 it in our power at once to persuade and obtain what we wish??How
 then can any one hereafter hope that he shall be fortunate? So many
 children that I had, and now not one is left to me. But I am perishing a
 captive in base servitude, and yet see the smoke there leaping aloft from
 the city. And however this part of my argument may perchance be vain, the
 bringing forward love; still nevertheless it shall be urged. My daughter
 is wont to sleep by thy side, that prophetess, whom the Trojans call
 Cassandra. Where wilt thou show that thy nights were nights of love, O
 king, or will my daughter receive any recompense for her most fond
 embraces, and I through her? [For from the secret shade, and from night's
 joys, the greatest delight is wont to spring to mortals.] Now then
 attend. Thou seest this corse? Him assisting, thou wilt assist one joined
 to thee in affinity. One thing my speech wants yet. I would fain I had a
 voice in my arms, and hands, and in my hair, and in my footsteps, or by
 the skill of D?dalus, or some God, that each at once might hold thy
 knees, weeping, and imploring in all the strains of eloquence. O my lord.
 O greatest light of the Greeks, be persuaded; lend thy hand to avenge
 this aged woman, although she is of no consequence, yet avenge her. For
 it belongs to a good man to minister justice, and always and in every
 case to punish the bad.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. It is strange, how every thing happens to mortals, and laws
 determine even the fates, making the greatest enemies friends, and
 enemies of those who before were on good terms.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. I, O Hecuba, have pity both on thee and thy son, thy misfortunes,
 and thy suppliant touch, and I am willing in regard both to the Gods and
 to justice, that this impious host should give thee full revenge,
 provided a way could be found, that both you might be gratified, and I
 might in the eyes of the army not seem to meditate this destruction
 against the king of Thrace for Cassandra's sake. For there is a point in
 which apprehension hath reached me. This man the army deems a friend, the
 dead an enemy; but if he is dear to thee, this is a private feeling and
 does not affect the army. Wherefore consider, that thou hast me willing
 to labor with thee, and ready to assist thee, but backward, should I be
 murmured against among the Greeks.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Alas! no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave
 of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of
 the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural
 inclinations. But since thou fearest, and payest too much regard to the
 multitude, I will liberate thee from this fear. For consent with me, if I
 meditate vengeance against the murderer of this youth, but do not act
 with me. But should any tumult or offer of assistance arise from out of
 the Greeks, when the Thracian feels the punishment he shall feel,
 suppress it, not appearing to do it for my sake: but of the rest be
 confident: I will dispose all things well.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. How then? What wilt thou do? Wilt thou grasp the sword in thine
 aged hand, and strike the barbarian? or with poison wilt thou work, or
 with what assistance? What hand will conspire with thee? whence wilt thou
 procure friends?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. These tents inclose a host of Trojan dames.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Meanest thou the captives, the booty of the Greeks?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. With these will I avenge me of my murderer.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. And how shall the victory over men be to women?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Numbers are powerful, with stratagem invincible.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Powerful, I grant; I mistrust however the race of women.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. And why? Did not women slay the sons of ?gyptus,<sup>[16]</sup> and utterly
 extirpated the race of men from Lemnos?<sup>[17]</sup> But thus let it be. Give up this
 discussion. But grant this woman to pass in safety through the army. And
 do thou go to the Thracian host and tell him, "Hecuba, once queen of
 Troy, sends for you on business of no less importance to yourself than to
 her, and your sons likewise, since it is of consequence that your
 children also should hear her words."?And do thou, O Agamemnon, as
 yet forbear to raise the tomb over the newly-sacrificed Polyxena, that
 these two, the brother and the sister, the divided care of their mother,
 may, when reduced to ashes by one and the same flame, be interred side by
 side.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Thus shall it be. And yet, if the army could sail, I should not
 have it in my power to grant thy request: but now, for the deity breathes
 not prosperous gales, we must wait, watching for a calm voyage. But may
 things turn out well some way or other: for this is a general principle
 among all, both individuals in private and states, That the wicked man
 should feel vengeance, but the good man enjoy prosperity.</p><br>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>O thou, my country of Troy, no longer shall thou be called the city of
 the invincible, such a cloud of Grecians envelops thee, with the spear,
 with the spear having destroyed thee. And thou hast been shorn of thy
 crown of turrets, and thou hast been discolored by the dismal blackness
 of smoke; hapless city, no longer shall I tread my steps in thee.</p><br>

 <p>In the midnight hour I perished, when after the feast sweet sleep is
 scattered over the eyes. And my husband, from the song and cheerful
 sacrifice retired, was sleeping peacefully in my bed, his spear on its
 peg, no more dreaming to behold the naval host of the Greeks treading the
 streets of Troy. But I was binding my braided hair with fillets fastened
 on the top of mine head, looking into the round polished surface of the
 golden mirror, that I might get into my bed prepared for me. On a sudden
 a tumultuous cry penetrated the city; and this shout of exhortation was
 heard in the streets of Troy, "When indeed, ye sons of Grecians, when,
 <i>if not now</i>, will ye return to your homes having overthrown the
 proud citadel of Ilium!" And having left my dear bed, in a single robe,
 like a Spartan virgin, flying for aid to the venerable shrine of Diana, I
 hapless fled in vain. And I am dragged, after having seen my husband
 slain, to the ocean waves; and casting a distant look back upon my city,
 after the vessel had begun her way in her return to Greece, and divided
 me from the land of Troy, I wretched fainted through anguish. And
 consigning to curses Helen, the sister of the Twin Brothers, and the
 Idean shepherd, the ruthless Paris, since his marriage, no marriage, but
 some Fury's hate hath utterly destroyed me far from my native land, and
 hath driven me from my home. Whom may the ocean refuse ever to bear back
 again; and may she never reach again her paternal home.</p><br>

<p class="center">POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. O Priam, thou dearest of men, and thou most dear Hecuba, at thy
 sight I weep for thee, and thy city, and thy daughter who has lately
 died. Alas! there is nothing secure, neither glory, nor when one is
 faring well is there a certainty that he will not fare ill. But the Gods
 mingle these things promiscuously to and fro, making all confusion, so
 that we through ignorance may worship them. But wherefore should I utter
 these plaints, which in no way tend to free thee from thy former
 calamities. But thou, if thou hast aught to blame for my absence,
 forbear; for I chanced to be afar off in the middle of my Thracian
 territories, when thou camest hither; but soon as I returned, as I was
 already setting out from my house, this maid of thine met me for the
 self-same purpose, and delivered thy message, which when I had heard, I
 came.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O Polymestor, I am ashamed to look thee in the face, sunk as I am
 in such miseries; for before one who has seen me in prosperity, shame
 overwhelms me, being in the state in which I now am, nor can I look upon
 thee with unmoved eyes. But impute not this to any enmity I bear thee;
 but there are other causes, and in some degree this law; "that women
 ought not to gaze at men."</p><br>

 <p>POLY. And 'tis indeed no wonder; but what need hast thou of me? for
 what purpose didst thou send for me to come from home?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I am desirous of communicating a private affair of my own to thee
 and thy children; but order thy attendants to retire from these
 tents.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Depart, for here to be alone is safe. Friendly thou art, this
 Grecian army too is friendly toward me, but it is for thee to signify, in
 what manner I, who am in good circumstances, ought to succor my friends
 in distress; since, on my part, I am ready.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. First then tell me of my son Polydore, whom thou retainest,
 receiving him from mine, and from his father's hand, if he live; but the
 rest I shall inquire of thee afterward.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. He lives, and in good health; as far as regards him indeed thou
 art happy.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. O my best friend, how well thou speakest, and how worthily of
 thyself!</p><br>

 <p>POLY. What dost thou wish then to inquire of me in the next place?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Whether he remembers at all me, his mother?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Yes: and he even sought to come to thee by stealth.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. And is the gold safe, which he brought with him from Troy?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. It is safe, at least it is guarded in my house.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Preserve it therefore, nor covet the goods of others.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Certainly not. May I enjoy what is mine own, O lady.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Knowest thou then, what I wish to say to thee and thy
 children?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. I do not: this shalt thou signify by thy speech.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Be my son loved by thee, as thou art now loved of me.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. What is it, that I and my sons must know?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. The ancient buried treasures of the family of Priam.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Is it this thou wishest me to inform thy son of?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Yes, certainly; through thee at least, for thou art a pious
 man.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. What necessity then is there for the presence of these
 children?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. 'Tis better in case of thy death, that these should know.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Well hast thou thus said, and 'tis the wiser plan.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Thou knowest then where the temple of Minerva in Troy
 is?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Is the gold there! but what is the mark?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. A black rock rising above the earth.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Hast any thing further to tell me of what is there?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. No, but I wish thee to take care of some treasures, with which I
 came out of the city.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Where are they then? Hast thou them hidden beneath thy
 robes?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Amidst a heap of spoils they are preserved in this tent.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. But where? These are the naval encampments of the Grecians.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. The habitations of the captive women are private.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. And is all secure within, and untenanted by men?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Not one of the Greeks is within, but we women only. But come into
 the tent, for the Greeks are desirous of loosing the sheets of their
 vessels homeward from Troy; so that, having done every thing that thou
 oughtest, thou mayest go with thy children to that place where thou hast
 given my son to dwell.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Not yet hast thou suffered, but peradventure thou wilt suffer
 vengeance; as a man falling headlong into the gulf where no harbor is,
 shalt thou be hurled from thy dear heart, having lost thy life;<sup>[18]</sup> for where the
 rites of hospitality coincide<sup>[19]</sup> with justice, and with the Gods,
 <i>on the villain who dares to violate these</i> destructive, destructive
 indeed impends the evil. But thy hopes will deceive thee, which thou
 entertainedst from this journey, which has brought thee, thou wretched
 man, to the deadly mansions of Pluto; but thou shalt quit thy life by no
 warrior's hand.</p><br>

<p class="center">POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, SEMICHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Oh me! I wretch am deprived of the sight of mine eyes.</p><br>

 <p>SEMI. Heard ye the shriek of the man of Thrace, my friends?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Oh me; there again?Oh my children, thy miserable
 butchery!</p><br>

 <p>SEMI. My friends, some strange ills have been perpetrated within the
 tents.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. But for all your nimble feet, ye never can escape me, for by my
 blows will I burst open the recesses of these tents.</p><br>

 <p>SEMI. Behold, he uses violently the weapon of his heavy hand. Will ye
 that we fall on; since the instant calls on us to be present with
 assistance to Hecuba and the Trojan dames?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Dash on, spare nothing, break down the gates, for thou never
 shalt replace the clear sight in those pupils, nor shalt thou behold
 alive those children which I have slain.</p><br>

 <p>SEMI. What! hast thou vanquished the Thracian? and hast thou got the
 mastery over this host, my mistress? and hast thou done such deeds, as
 thou sayest?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Thou wilt see him quickly before the house, blind, with blind
 wandering steps approaching, and the bodies of his two children, whom I
 have slain with these most valiant Trojan women; but he has felt my
 vengeance; but he is coming as thou seest from the tent. But I will
 retire out of his way, and make good my retreat from the boiling rage of
 this most desperate Thracian.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Alas me! whither can I go? where stand? whither shall I direct
 my way, advancing my steps like the four-footed mountain beast on my
 hands and on my feet in pursuit? What new path shall I take in this
 direction or in that, desirous of seizing these murderous Trojan dames,
 who have utterly destroyed me; O ye impious, impious Phrygian daughters!
 Ah the accursed, in what corner do they shrink from me in flight? Would
 that thou, O sun, could'st heal, could'st heal these bleeding lids of my
 eyes, and remove this gloomy-darkness. Ah, hush, hush! I hear the
 carefully-concealed step of these women. Whither shall I direct my course
 in order that I may glut myself on the flesh and bones of these, making
 the wild beasts' banquet, inflicting vengeance on them, in return for the
 injuries done me. Wretch that I am! Whither, whither am I borne, having
 left my children deserted, for these fiends of hell to tear piecemeal, a
 mangled, bleeding, savage prey to dogs, and a thing to cast out on the
 mountains? Where shall I stand? Whither turn? Whither go, as a ship
 setting her yellow canvas sails with her sea-washed palsers, rushing to
 this lair of death, the protector of my children?</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. O miserable man, what intolerable evils have been perpetrated by
 thee! but on thee having done base deeds the God hath sent dreadful
 punishment, whoever he be that presses heavy on thee.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Alas! alas! O Thracian nation, brandishing the spear, warlike,
 bestriding the steed, nation ruled by Mars; O ye Greeks, sons of Atreus;
 I raise the cry, the cry, the cry; Come, come, hasten, I entreat you by
 the Gods. Does any hear, or will no one assist me? Why do ye delay? The
 women have destroyed me, the captive women. Horrible, horrible treatment
 have I suffered. Alas me for my ruin! Whither can I turn? Whither can I
 go? Shall I soar through the ethereal skies to the lofty mansions where
 Orion or Sirius dart from their eyes the flaming rays of fire: or shall I
 hapless rush to the gloomy shore of Pluto?</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. It is pardonable, when any one suffers greater misfortunes than
 he can bear, for him to be desirous to quit a miserable life.</p><br>

<p class="center">AGAMEMNON, POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. I came having heard the clamor: for Echo, the mountain's
 daughter, did not sound in gentle strains through the army, causing a
 disturbance. But did we not know that the Phrygian towers are fallen
 beneath the Grecian spear, this tumult might have caused no little
 terror.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. O my dearest friend (for I know thee, Agamemnon, having heard
 thy voice), seest thou what I am suffering?</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Ah! wretched Polymestor, who hath destroyed thee? who made thine
 eyes sightless, having drowned their orbs in blood? And who hath slain
 these thy children? Sure, whoe'er it was, felt the greatest rage against
 thee and thy sons.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Hecuba with the female captives hath destroyed me?nay, not
 destroyed me, but more than destroyed me.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. What sayest thou? Hast thou done this deed, as he affirms? Hast
 thou, Hecuba, dared this inconceivable act of boldness?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Ah me! what wilt thou say? Is she any where near me? Show me,
 tell me where she is, that I may seize her in my hands, and tear
 piecemeal and mangle her body.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. What ho! what are you doing?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. By the Gods I entreat thee, suffer me to lay my raging hand upon
 her.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Forbear. And having banished this barbarous deed from thy
 thoughts, speak; that having heard both thee and her in your respective
 turns, I may decide justly, in return for what thou art suffering these
 ills.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. I will speak then. There was a certain youth, the youngest of
 Priam's children, by name Polydore, the son of Hecuba; him his father
 Priam sent to me from Troy to bring up in my palace, already presaging<sup>[20]</sup> the capture of
 Troy. Him I put to death. But for what cause I put him to death, with
 what policy and prudent forethought, now hear. I feared, lest the boy
 being left an enemy to thee, should collect the scattered remnants of
 Troy, and again people the city. And lest the Greeks, having discovered
 that one of the sons of Priam was alive, should again direct an
 expedition against the Phrygian land, and after that should harass and
 lay waste the plains of Thrace; and it might fare ill with the neighbors
 of the Trojans, under which misfortune, O king, we are now laboring. But
 Hecuba, when she had discovered her son's death, by such treachery as
 this lured me hither, as about to tell me of treasure belonging to
 Priam's family concealed in Troy, and introduces me alone with my sons
 into the tent, that no one else might know it. And I sat, having reclined
 on the centre of the couch; but many Trojan damsels, some from the left
 hand, and others from the right, sat round me, as by an intimate friend,
 holding in their hands the Edonian looms, and praised these robes,
 looking at them in the light; but others, beholding with admiration my
 Thracian spear, deprived me of my double ornament. But as many as were
 mothers caressed my children in their arms in seeming admiration, that
 they might be farther removed from their father, successively handing
 them from one to another: and then, amidst their kind blandishments, what
 think you? in an instant, snatching from somewhere beneath their garments
 their daggers, they stab my children. But they having seized me in an
 hostile manner held my hands and feet; and if, wishing to succor my
 children, I raised my head, they held me by the hair: but if I attempted
 to move my hands, I wretched could effect nothing through the host of
 women. But at last, cruelty and worse than cruelty, they perpetrated
 dreadful things; for having taken their clasps they pierce and gore the
 wretched pupils of my eyes, then vanish in flight through the tent. But
 I, having leaped out, like some exasperated beast, pursue the
 blood-stained wretches, searching every wall, as the hunter, casting
 down, rending. This have I suffered, while studious to advance thy
 interest, Agamemnon, and having killed thine enemy. But that I may not
 extend my speech to a greater length, if any one of those of ancient
 times hath reviled women, or if any one doth now, or shall hereafter
 revile them, I will comprise the whole when I say, that such a race
 neither doth the sea nor the earth produce, but he who is always with
 them knows it best.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Be not at all insolent, nor, in thy calamities, thus
 comprehending the female sex, abuse them all. For of us there are many,
 some indeed are envied <i>for their virtues</i>, but some are by nature
 in the catalogue of bad things.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Agamemnon, it never were fitting among men that the tongue should
 have greater force than actions. But if a man has acted well, well should
 he speak; if on the other hand basely, his words likewise should be
 unsound, and never ought he to be capable of speaking unjust things well.
 Perhaps indeed they who have brought these things to a pitch of accuracy
 are accounted wise, but they can not endure wise unto the end, but perish
 vilely, nor has any one yet escaped this. And this in my prelude is what
 I have to say to thee. Now am I going to direct my discourse to this man,
 and I will answer his arguments. Thou, that assertest, that in order to
 rid the Greeks of their redoubled toil, and for Agamemnon's sake that
 thou didst slay my son? But, in the first place, monstrous villain, never
 can the race of barbarians be friendly to the Grecians, never can this
 take place. But what favor wert thou so eagerly currying? wert thou about
 to contract an alliance, or was it that thou wert of kindred birth, or
 what pretext hadst thou? or were they about to ravage the crops of thy
 country, having sailed thither again? Whom, thinkest thou, wilt thou
 persuade of these things? The gold, if thou wert willing to speak truth,
 the gold destroyed my son, and thy base gains. For come, tell me this;
 how when Troy was prosperous, and a tower yet girt around the city, and
 Priam lived, and the spear of Hector was in its glory, why didst thou not
 then, if thou wert willing to lay him under this obligation, bringing up
 my child, and retaining him in thy palace, why didst thou not then slay
 him, or go and take him alive to the Greeks? But when we were no longer
 in the light of prosperity, and the city by its smoke showed that it was
 in the power of the enemy, thou slewest thy guest who had come to thy
 hearth. Now hear besides how thou wilt appear vile: thou oughtest, if
 thou wert the friend of the Greeks, to have given the gold, which thou
 confessedst thou hast, not thine, but his, distributing to those who were
 in need, and had long been strangers to their native land. But thou, even
 now, hast not courage to part with it from thy hand, but having it, thou
 still art keeping it close in thine house. And yet, in bringing up my
 child, as it was thy duty to bring him up, and in preserving him, thou
 hadst had fair honor. For in adversity friends are most clearly proved
 good. But good circumstances have in every case their friends. But if
 thou wert in want of money, and he in a flourishing condition, my son had
 been to thee a vast treasure; but now, thou neither hast him for thy
 friend, and the benefit from the gold is gone, and thy sons are gone, and
 thou art?as thou art. But to thee, Agamemnon, I say; if thou aidest
 this man, thou wilt appear to be doing wrong. For thou wilt be conferring
 a benefit on a host, who is neither pious, nor faithful to those to whom
 he ought, not holy, not just. But we shall say that thou delightest in
 the bad, if thus thou actest: but I speak no offense to my lords.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Ah! Ah! How do good deeds ever supply to men the source of good
 words!</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Thankless my office to decide on others' grievances; but still I
 must, for it brings disgrace on a man, having taken a thing in hand, to
 give it up. But to me, be assured, thou neither appearest for my sake,
 nor for the sake of the Grecians, to have killed this man thy guest, but
 that thou mightest possess the gold in thy palace. But thou talkest of
 thy advantage, when thou art in calamities.<sup>[21]</sup> Perhaps with you it is a slight thing
 to kill your guests; but with us Grecians this thing is abhorred. How
 then, in giving my decision that thou hast not injured, can I escape
 blame? I can not; but as thou hast dared to do things dishonorable,
 endure now things unpleasant.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Alas me! worsted, as it seems, by a woman who is a slave, I
 shall submit to the vengeance of my inferiors.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Will it not then be justly, seeing thou hast acted wrong?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Alas me! wretched on account of these children and on account of
 my eyes.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Thou sufferest? but what do I? Thinkest thou I suffer not for my
 child?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Thou rejoicest in insulting me, O thou malicious woman.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. For ought not I to rejoice on having avenged myself on thee?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. But thou wilt not soon, when the liquid wave?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Shall bear me, <i>dost thou mean</i>, to the confines of the
 Grecian land?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. ?shall cover thee, having fallen from the shrouds.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. From whom meeting with this violent leap?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Thyself shalt climb with thy feet up the ship's mast.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Having wings on my back, or in what way?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. But how dost thou know of this my metamorphose?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Dionysius the Thracian prophet told it me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. But did he not declare to thee any of the evils which thou
 sufferest?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. No: for, <i>if he had</i>, thou never wouldst thus treacherously
 have taken me.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. <sup>[22]</sup>Thence
 shall I conclude my life in death, or still live on?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Thou shalt die. But the name of thy tomb shall be?</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Dost thou speak of it as in any way correspondent to my
 shape?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. <sup>[23]</sup>The
 tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I heed it not, since thou at least hast felt my vengeance.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. And it is fated too for thy daughter Cassandra to die.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. I renounce these prophecies; I give them for thyself to bear.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Him shall his wife slay, a cruel guardian of his house.</p><br>

 <p>HEC. Never yet may the daughter of Tyndarus have arrived at such
 madness.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Even this man himself, having lifted up the axe.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. What ho! thou art mad, and art desirous of obtaining greater
 ills.</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Kill me, for the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Will ye not, slaves, forcibly drag him from my presence?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Thou art galled at what thou hearest.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Will ye not stop his mouth?</p><br>

 <p>POLY. Stop it: for the word is spoken.</p><br>

 <p>AGA. Will ye not as quick as possible cast him out on some desert
 island, since he is thus, and past endurance insolent? But do thou,
 wretched Hecuba, go and bury thy two dead: and you, O Trojan dames, must
 approach your masters' tents, for I perceive that the gales are favorable
 for wafting us to our homes. And may we sail in safety to our native
 country, and behold our household and families in prosperity, having
 found rest from these toils.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Come, my friends, to the harbor, and the tents, to undergo the
 tasks imposed by our masters. For necessity is relentless.</p><br>

<h3>NOTES ON HECUBA</h3>

<hr class="short">

<div class="note">
 <p>[1] Homer makes Dymas, not
 Cisseus, the father of Hecuba. Virgil however follows Euripides, the rest
 of the Latin poets Virgil.</p><br>

 <p>[2] In the martial time of
 antiquity the spear was reverenced as something divine, and signified the
 chief command in arms, it was also the insigne of the highest civil
 authority: in this sense Euripides in other places uses the word <span title="dory" lang="el">&#948;&#959;&#961;&#965;</span>. See Hippol.
 988.</p><br>

 <p>[3] <span title="tritaios" lang="el">&#964;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>
 properly signifies <i>triduanus</i>; here it is used for <span title="tritos" lang="el">&#964;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, the
 cardinal number for the ordinal. So also Hippol. 275.</p><br>

 <p>[15] See note on Medea

 <p>[16] The story of the
 daughters of Danaus is well known.</p><br>

 <p>[17] Of this there are two
 accounts given in the Scholia. The one is, that the women of Lemnos being
 punished by Venus with an ill savor, and therefore neglected by their
 husbands, conspired against them and slew them. The other is found in
 Herodotus, Erato, chap. 138. see also ?sch. Choephor?, line 627, ed.

 and <span title="asebeias" lang="el">&#945;&#963;&#949;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#962;</span>,

 <p>The Chorus therefore says, <i>Ubi contingit eundem et Justiti? et Diis
 esse addictum, exitiale semper malum esse</i>; or, as the learned
 Hemsterheuyse has more fully and more elegantly expressed, it,
 <i>Ubi</i>, id est, <i>in quo</i>, vel <i>in quem cadit et concurrit, ut
 ob crimen commissum simul et human? justiti? et Deorum vindict? sit
 obnoxius, ac velut oppignoratus; illi certissimum exitium imminet</i>.
 This sense the words give, if for <span title="ou" lang="el">&#959;&#965;</span>, we read <span title="hou" lang="el">&#8219;&#959;&#965;</span>, i.e. in the sense of <span title="hopou" lang="el">&#8219;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#965;</span>.

 <p>[20] The verbal adjective

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short">

 <p>Orestes, in revenge for the murder of his father, took off ?gisthus
 and Cly?tmnestra; but having dared to slay his mother, he was instantly
 punished for it by being afflicted with madness. But on Tyndarus, the
 father of her who was slain, laying an accusation against him, the
 Argives were about to give a public decision on this question, "What
 ought he, who has dared this impious deed, to suffer?" By chance
 Menelaus, having returned from his wanderings, sent in Helen indeed by
 night, but himself came by day, and being entreated by Orestes to aid
 him, he rather feared Tyndarus the accuser: but when the speeches came to
 be spoken among the populace, the multitude were stirred up to kill
 Orestes. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But Pylades, his friend, accompanying him, counseled him
 first to take revenge on Menelaus by killing Helen. As they were going on
 this project, they were disappointed of their hope by the Gods snatching
 away Helen from them. But Electra delivered up Hermione, when she made
 her appearance, into their hands, and they were about to kill her. When
 Menelaus came, and saw himself bereft by them at once of his wife and
 child, he endeavored to storm the palace; but they, anticipating his
 purpose, threatened to set it on fire. Apollo, however, having appeared,
 said that he had conducted Helen to the Gods, and commanded Orestes to
 take Hermione to wife, and Electra to dwell with Pylades, and, after that
 he was purified of the murder, to reign over Argos.</p><br>

 <p>The scene of the piece is laid at Argos; But the chorus consists of
 Argive women, intimate associates of Electra, who also come on inquiring
 about the calamity of Orestes. The play has a catastrophe rather suited
 to comedy. The opening scene of the play is thus arranged. Orestes is
 discovered before the palace of Agamemnon, fatigued, and, on account of
 his madness, lying on a couch on which Electra is sitting by him at his
 feet. A difficulty has been started, why does not she sit at his head?
 for thus would she seem to watch more tenderly over her brother, if she
 sat nearer him. The poet, it is answered, seems to have made this
 arrangement on account of the Chorus; for Orestes, who had but just then
 and with difficulty gotten to sleep, would have been awakened, if the
 women that constituted the Chorus had stood nearer to him. But this we
 may infer from what Electra says to the Chorus, "<span title="Siga, siga, lepton ichnos arbyl?is" lang="el">&#931;&#953;&#947;&#945;,
 &#963;&#953;&#947;&#945;, &#955;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;
 &#953;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;
 &#945;&#961;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#951;&#953;&#962;</span>." It is
 probable then that the above is the reason of this arrangement.</p><br>

 <p>The play is among the most celebrated on the stage, but infamous in
 its morals; for, with the exception of Pylades, all the characters are
 bad persons.</p><br>

<h2>ORESTES.</h2>

<hr class="short">

<p class="center">ELECTRA.</p><br>

 <p>There is no word so dreadful to relate, nor suffering, nor
 heaven-inflicted calamity, the burden of which human nature may not be
 compelled to bear. For Tantalus, the blest, (and I am not reproaching his
 fortune, <i>when I say this</i>,) the son of Jupiter, as they report,
 trembling at the rock which impends over his head, hangs in the air, and
 suffers this punishment, as they say indeed, because, although being a
 man, yet having the honor of a table in common with the Gods upon equal
 terms, he possessed an ungovernable tongue, a most disgraceful malady. He
 begat Pelops, and from him sprung Atreus, for whom the Goddess having
 carded the wool<sup>[1]</sup> spun the thread of contention, <i>and
 doomed him</i> to make war on Thyestes his relation; (why must I
 commemorate things unspeakable?) But Atreus then<sup>[2]</sup> killed his children?and feasted
 him. But from Atreus, for I pass over in silence the misfortunes which
 intervened, sprung Agamemnon, the illustrious, (if he was indeed
 illustrious,) and Menelaus; their mother A?rope of Crete. But Menelaus
 indeed marries Helen, the hated of the Gods, but King Agamemnon
 <i>obtained</i> Clyt?mnestra's bed, memorable throughout the Grecians:
 from whom we virgins were born, three from one mother; Chrysothemis, and
 Iphigenia, and myself Electra; and Orestes the male part of the family,
 from a most unholy mother, who slew her husband, having covered him
 around with an inextricable robe; the reason however it is not decorous
 in a virgin to tell; I leave this undeclared for men to consider as they
 will. But why indeed must I accuse the injustice of Ph?bus? Yet
 persuaded he Orestes to kill that mother that brought him forth, a deed
 which gained not a good report from all men. But nevertheless he did slay
 her, as he would not be disobedient to the God. I also took a share in
 the murder, but such as a woman ought to take. As did Pylades also who
 perpetrated this deed with us. From that time wasting away, the wretched
 Orestes is afflicted with a grievous malady, but falling on his couch
 there lies, but his mother's blood whirls him to frenzy (for I dread to
 mention those Goddesses, the Eumenides, who persecute him with terror).
 Moreover this is the sixth day since his slaughtered mother was purified
 by fire as to her body. During which he has neither taken any food down
 his throat, he has not bathed his limbs, but covered beneath his cloak,
 when indeed his body is lightened of its disease, on coming to his right
 mind he weeps, but at another time starts suddenly from his couch, as a
 colt from his yoke. But it has been decreed by this city of Argos, that
 no one shall receive us who have slain a mother under their roof, nor at
 their fire, and that none shall speak to us; but this is the appointed
 day, in the which the city of the Argives will pronounce their vote,
 whether it is fitting that we should die being stoned with stones, or
 having whet the sword, should plunge it into our necks. But I yet have
 some hope that we may not die, for Menelaus has arrived at this country
 from Troy, and filling the Nauplian harbor with his oars is mooring his
 fleet off the shore, having been lost in wanderings from Troy a long
 time: but the much-afflicted Helen has he sent before to our palace,
 having taken advantage of the night, lest any of those, whose children
 died under Ilium, when they saw her coming, by day, might go so far as to
 stone her; but she is within bewailing her sister, and the calamity of
 her family. She has however some consolation in her woes, for the virgin
 Hermione, whom Menelaus bringing from Sparta, left at our palace, when he
 sailed to Troy, and gave as a charge to my mother to bring up, in her she
 rejoices, and forgets her miseries. But I am looking at each avenue when
 I shall see Menelaus present, since, for the rest, we ride on slender
 power,<sup>[3]</sup> if we
 receive not some succor from him; the house of the unfortunate is an
 embarrassed state of affairs.</p><br>

<p class="center">ELECTRA. HELEN.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. O daughter of Clyt?mnestra and Agamemnon, O Electra, thou that
 hast remained a virgin a long time. How are ye, O wretched woman, both
 you, and your brother, the wretched Orestes (he was the murderer of his
 mother)? For by thy converse I am not polluted, transferring, as I do,
 the blame to Ph?bus. And yet I groan the death of Clyt?mnestra,
 whom, after that I sailed to Troy, (how did I sail, urged by the
 maddening fate of the Gods!) I saw not, but of her bereft I lament my
 fortune.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. Helen, why should I inform thee of things thou seest thyself
 here present, the race of Agamemnon in calamities. I indeed sleepless sit
 companion to the wretched corse, (for he is a corse, in that he breathes
 so little,) but at his fortune I murmur not. But thou a happy woman, and
 thy husband a happy man, have come to us, who fare most wretchedly.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. But what length of time has he been lying on his couch?</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. Ever since he shed his parent's blood.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. Oh wretched, and his mother too, that thus she perished!</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. These things are thus, so that he is unable to speak for
 misery.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. By the Gods wilt thou oblige me in a thing, O virgin?</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. As far as I am permitted by the little leisure I have from
 watching by my brother.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. Wilt thou go to the tomb of my sister?</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. My mother's tomb dost thou desire? wherefore?</p><br>

 <p>HEL. Bearing the first offerings of my hair, and my libations.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. But is it not lawful for thee to go to the tomb of thy
 friends?</p><br>

 <p>HEL. No, for I am ashamed to show myself among the Argives.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. Late art thou discreet, then formerly leaving thine home
 disgracefully.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. True hast thou spoken, but thou speakest not pleasantly to
 me.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. But what shame possesses thee among the Myceneans?</p><br>

 <p>HEL. I fear the fathers of those who are dead under Ilium.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. For this is a dreadful thing; and at Argos thou art declaimed
 against by every one's mouth.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. Do thou then grant me this favor, and free me from this fear.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. I can not look upon the tomb of my mother.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. And yet it is disgraceful for servants to bear these.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. But why not send thy daughter Hermione?</p><br>

 <p>HEL. It is not well for virgins to go among the crowd.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. And yet she might repay the dead the care of her education.</p><br>

 <p>HEL. Right hast thou spoken, and I obey thee, O virgin, and I will
 send my daughter, for thou sayest well. Come forth, my child Hermione,
 before the house, and take these libations in thine hand, and my hair,
 and, going to the tomb of Clyt?mnestra, leave there this mixture of milk
 and honey, and the froth of wine, and standing on the summit of the
 mound, say thus: "Helen, thy sister, presents thee with these libations,
 in fear herself to approach thy tomb, and afraid of the populace of
 Argos:" and bid her hold kind intentions toward me, and thyself, and my
 husband, and toward these two miserable persons whom the God has
 destroyed. But promise all the offerings to the manes, whatever it is
 fitting that I should perform for a sister. Go, my child, hasten, and
 when thou hast offered the libations at the tomb, remember to return back
 as speedily as possible.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. [<i>alone</i>] O Nature, what a great evil art thou among men,
 and the safeguard of those who possess thee, with virtue! For see, how
 she has shorn off the extremities of her hair, in order to preserve her
 beauty; but she is the same woman she always was. May the Gods detest
 thee, for that thou hast destroyed me, and this man, and the whole state
 of Greece: oh wretch that I am! But my dear friends that accompany me in
 my lamentations are again present; perhaps they will disturb the sleeper
 from his slumber, and will melt my eyes in tears when I behold my brother
 raving.</p><br>

<p class="center">ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. O most dear woman, proceed with a gentle foot, make no noise,
 let there be heard no sound. For your friendliness is very kind, but to
 awake him will be a calamity to me. Hush, hush?gently advance the
 tread of thy sandal, make no noise, let there be heard no sound. Move
 onward from that place?onward from before the couch.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Behold, I obey.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. St! st! Speak to me, my friend, as the breathing of the soft
 reed pipe.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. See, I utter a voice low as an under note.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. Ay, thus come hither, come hither, approach quietly?go
 quietly: tell me, for what purpose, I pray, are ye come? For he has
 fallen on his couch, and been sleeping some time.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. How is he? Give us an account of him, my friend.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. What fortune can I say of him? and what his calamities? still
 indeed he breathes, but sighs at short intervals.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. What sayest thou? Oh, the unhappy man!</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. You will kill him if you move his eyelids, now that he is taking
 the sweetest enjoyment of sleep.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Unfortunate on account of these most angry deeds from heaven!
 oh! wretched on account of thy sufferings!</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. Alas! alas! Apollo himself unjust, then spoke unjust things,
 when at the tripod of Themis he commanded the unhallowed, inauspicious
 murder of my mother.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. Dost thou see? he moves his body in the robes that cover
 him.</p><br>

 <p>ELEC. You by your cries, O wretch, have disturbed him from his
 sleep.</p><br>

 <p>CHOR. I indeed think he is sleeping yet.</p><br>
