 <h2>
 Chapter One
 </h2>
 <p>
 We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new fellow,"
 not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large
 desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just
 surprised at his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the
 class-master, he said to him in a low voice?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he'll be
 in the second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory, he will go into
 one of the upper classes, as becomes his age."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The "new fellow," standing in the corner behind the door so that he could
 hardly be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of
 us. His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village chorister's; he
 looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he was not
 broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black
 buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the
 opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in
 blue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by
 braces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as attentive
 as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow;
 and when at two o'clock the bell rang, the master was obliged to tell him
 to fall into line with the rest of us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on
 the ground so as to have our hands more free; we used from the door to
 toss them under the form, so that they hit against the wall and made a lot
 of dust: it was "the thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt it,
 the "new fellow," was still holding his cap on his knees even after
 prayers were over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in
 which we can find traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin
 cap, and cotton night-cap; one of those poor things, in fine, whose dumb
 ugliness has depths of expression, like an imbecile's face. Oval,
 stiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in
 succession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated by a red band;
 after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with
 complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord,
 small twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel. The cap was new; its
 peak shone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rise," said the master.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He stooped to
 pick it up. A neighbor knocked it down again with his elbow; he picked it
 up once more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get rid of your helmet," said the master, who was a bit of a wag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the
 poor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether to keep his cap
 in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his head. He sat down
 again and placed it on his knee.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rise," repeated the master, "and tell me your name."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Again!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the tittering of
 the class.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Louder!" cried the master; "louder!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The "new fellow" then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately
 large mouth, and shouted at the top of his voice as if calling someone in
 the word "Charbovari."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill voices (they
 yelled, barked, stamped, repeated "Charbovari! Charbovari"), then died
 away into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty, and
 now and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose
 here and there, like a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually re-established in
 the class; and the master having succeeded in catching the name of
 "Charles Bovary," having had it dictated to him, spelt out, and re-read,
 at once ordered the poor devil to go and sit down on the punishment form
 at the foot of the master's desk. He got up, but before going hesitated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you looking for?" asked the master.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My c-a-p," timidly said the "new fellow," casting troubled looks round
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Five hundred lines for all the class!" shouted in a furious voice
 stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. "Silence!" continued the
 master indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he had
 just taken from his cap. "As to you, 'new boy,' you will conjugate
 'ridiculus sum'** twenty times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, in a gentler tone, "Come, you'll find your cap again; it hasn't been
 stolen."
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.

 **I am ridiculous.
</pre>
 <p>
 Quiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the "new fellow" remained
 for two hours in an exemplary attitude, although from time to time some
 paper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came bang in his face. But he
 wiped his face with one hand and continued motionless, his eyes lowered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his desk,
 arranged his small belongings, and carefully ruled his paper. We saw him
 working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, and
 taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he showed,
 he had not to go down to the class below. But though he knew his rules
 passably, he had little finish in composition. It was the cure of his
 village who had taught him his first Latin; his parents, from motives of
 economy, having sent him to school as late as possible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired
 assistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain conscription
 scandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken
 advantage of his fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand
 francs that offered in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen in
 love with his good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his spurs
 ring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his
 fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours, he had
 the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune,
 dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in at
 night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law died,
 leaving little; he was indignant at this, "went in for the business," lost
 some money in it, then retired to the country, where he thought he would
 make money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his horses
 instead of sending them to plough, drank his cider in bottle instead of
 selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his farmyard, and greased
 his hunting-boots with the fat of his pigs, he was not long in finding out
 that he would do better to give up all speculation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the
 provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half private
 house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his luck, jealous
 of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he
 said, and determined to live at peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a thousand
 servilities that had only estranged him the more. Lively once, expansive
 and affectionate, in growing older she had become (after the fashion of
 wine that, exposed to air, turns to vinegar) ill-tempered, grumbling,
 irritable. She had suffered so much without complaint at first, until she
 had seem him going after all the village drabs, and until a score of bad
 houses sent him back to her at night, weary, stinking drunk. Then her
 pride revolted. After that she was silent, burying her anger in a dumb
 stoicism that she maintained till her death. She was constantly going
 about looking after business matters. She called on the lawyers, the
 president, remembered when bills fell due, got them renewed, and at home
 ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the workmen, paid the accounts, while
 he, troubling himself about nothing, eternally besotted in sleepy
 sulkiness, whence he only roused himself to say disagreeable things to
 her, sat smoking by the fire and spitting into the cinders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he came home,
 the lad was spoilt as if he were a prince. His mother stuffed him with
 jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and, playing the philosopher,
 even said he might as well go about quite naked like the young of animals.
 As opposed to the maternal ideas, he had a certain virile idea of
 childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing him to be brought
 up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong constitution. He sent him
 to bed without any fire, taught him to drink off large draughts of rum and
 to jeer at religious processions. But, peaceable by nature, the lad
 answered only poorly to his notions. His mother always kept him near her;
 she cut out cardboard for him, told him tales, entertained him with
 endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety and charming nonsense. In her
 life's isolation she centered on the child's head all her shattered,
 broken little vanities. She dreamed of high station; she already saw him,
 tall, handsome, clever, settled as an engineer or in the law. She taught
 him to read, and even, on an old piano, she had taught him two or three
 little songs. But to all this Monsieur Bovary, caring little for letters,
 said, "It was not worth while. Would they ever have the means to send him
 to a public school, to buy him a practice, or start him in business?
 Besides, with cheek a man always gets on in the world." Madame Bovary bit
 her lips, and the child knocked about the village.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens
 that were flying about. He ate blackberries along the hedges, minded the
 geese with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran about in the
 woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days, and at
 great fetes begged the beadle to let him toll the bells, that he might
 hang all his weight on the long rope and feel himself borne upward by it
 in its swing. Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on hand, fresh
 of colour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began lessons.
 The cure took him in hand; but the lessons were so short and irregular
 that they could not be of much use. They were given at spare moments in
 the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and a burial; or
 else the cure, if he had not to go out, sent for his pupil after the
 Angelus*. They went up to his room and settled down; the flies and moths
 fluttered round the candle. It was close, the child fell asleep, and the
 good man, beginning to doze with his hands on his stomach, was soon
 snoring with his mouth wide open. On other occasions, when Monsieur le
 Cure, on his way back after administering the viaticum to some sick person
 in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles playing about the fields, he
 called him, lectured him for a quarter of an hour and took advantage of
 the occasion to make him conjugate his verb at the foot of a tree. The
 rain interrupted them or an acquaintance passed. All the same he was
 always pleased with him, and even said the "young man" had a very good
 memory.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound
 of a bell. Here, the evening prayer.
</pre>
 <p>
 Charles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong steps.
 Ashamed, or rather tired out, Monsieur Bovary gave in without a struggle,
 and they waited one year longer, so that the lad should take his first
 communion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to
 school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October, at
 the time of the St. Romain fair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him.
 He was a youth of even temperament, who played in playtime, worked in
 school-hours, was attentive in class, slept well in the dormitory, and ate
 well in the refectory. He had in loco parentis* a wholesale ironmonger in
 the Rue Ganterie, who took him out once a month on Sundays after his shop
 was shut, sent him for a walk on the quay to look at the boats, and then
 brought him back to college at seven o'clock before supper. Every Thursday
 evening he wrote a long letter to his mother with red ink and three
 wafers; then he went over his history note-books, or read an old volume of
 "Anarchasis" that was knocking about the study. When he went for walks he
 talked to the servant, who, like himself, came from the country.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *In place of a parent.
</pre>
 <p>
 By dint of hard work he kept always about the middle of the class; once
 even he got a certificate in natural history. But at the end of his third
 year his parents withdrew him from the school to make him study medicine,
 convinced that he could even take his degree by himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother chose a room for him on the fourth floor of a dyer's she knew,
 overlooking the Eau-de-Robec. She made arrangements for his board, got him
 furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for an old cherry-tree
 bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron stove with the supply of
 wood that was to warm the poor child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand injunctions to be
 good now that he was going to be left to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The syllabus that he read on the notice-board stunned him; lectures on
 anatomy, lectures on pathology, lectures on physiology, lectures on
 pharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical medicine, and therapeutics,
 without counting hygiene and materia medica?all names of whose
 etymologies he was ignorant, and that were to him as so many doors to
 sanctuaries filled with magnificent darkness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen?he
 did not follow. Still he worked; he had bound note-books, he attended all
 the courses, never missed a single lecture. He did his little daily task
 like a mill-horse, who goes round and round with his eyes bandaged, not
 knowing what work he is doing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the carrier a piece
 of veal baked in the oven, with which he lunched when he came back from
 the hospital, while he sat kicking his feet against the wall. After this
 he had to run off to lectures, to the operation-room, to the hospital, and
 return to his home at the other end of the town. In the evening, after the
 poor dinner of his landlord, he went back to his room and set to work
 again in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot
 stove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are empty,
 when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the doors, he opened his
 window and leaned out. The river, that makes of this quarter of Rouen a
 wretched little Venice, flowed beneath him, between the bridges and the
 railings, yellow, violet, or blue. Working men, kneeling on the banks,
 washed their bare arms in the water. On poles projecting from the attics,
 skeins of cotton were drying in the air. Opposite, beyond the roots spread
 the pure heaven with the red sun setting. How pleasant it must be at home!
 How fresh under the beech-tree! And he expanded his nostrils to breathe in
 the sweet odours of the country which did not reach him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that
 made it nearly interesting. Naturally, through indifference, he abandoned
 all the resolutions he had made. Once he missed a lecture; the next day
 all the lectures; and, enjoying his idleness, little by little, he gave up
 work altogether. He got into the habit of going to the public-house, and
 had a passion for dominoes. To shut himself up every evening in the dirty
 public room, to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with
 black dots, seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom, which raised him in
 his own esteem. It was beginning to see life, the sweetness of stolen
 pleasures; and when he entered, he put his hand on the door-handle with a
 joy almost sensual. Then many things hidden within him came out; he learnt
 couplets by heart and sang them to his boon companions, became
 enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally, how
 to make love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thanks to these preparatory labours, he failed completely in his
 examination for an ordinary degree. He was expected home the same night to
 celebrate his success. He started on foot, stopped at the beginning of the
 village, sent for his mother, and told her all. She excused him, threw the
 blame of his failure on the injustice of the examiners, encouraged him a
 little, and took upon herself to set matters straight. It was only five
 years later that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was old then, and he
 accepted it. Moreover, he could not believe that a man born of him could
 be a fool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination, ceaselessly
 learning all the old questions by heart. He passed pretty well. What a
 happy day for his mother! They gave a grand dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Where should he go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only one old
 doctor. For a long time Madame Bovary had been on the look-out for his
 death, and the old fellow had barely been packed off when Charles was
 installed, opposite his place, as his successor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had him taught
 medicine, and discovered Tostes, where he could practice it; he must have
 a wife. She found him one?the widow of a bailiff at Dieppe?who
 was forty-five and had an income of twelve hundred francs. Though she was
 ugly, as dry as a bone, her face with as many pimples as the spring has
 buds, Madame Dubuc had no lack of suitors. To attain her ends Madame
 Bovary had to oust them all, and she even succeeded in very cleverly
 baffling the intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the priests.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he
 would be more free to do as he liked with himself and his money. But his
 wife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to fast
 every Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients who
 did not pay. She opened his letter, watched his comings and goings, and
 listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him in his
 surgery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without end. She
 constantly complained of her nerves, her chest, her liver. The noise of
 footsteps made her ill; when people left her, solitude became odious to
 her; if they came back, it was doubtless to see her die. When Charles
 returned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from
 beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit down
 on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was
 neglecting her, he loved another. She had been warned she would be
 unhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine and a little
 more love.

 <h2>
 Chapter Two
 </h2>
 <p>
 One night towards eleven o'clock they were awakened by the noise of a
 horse pulling up outside their door. The servant opened the garret-window
 and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below. He came for the
 doctor, had a letter for him. Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid
 the bars and bolts one after the other. The man left his horse, and,
 following the servant, suddenly came in behind her. He pulled out from his
 wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in a rag and presented it
 gingerly to Charles, who rested on his elbow on the pillow to read it.
 Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light. Madame in modesty had
 turned to the wall and showed only her back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged Monsieur Bovary
 to come immediately to the farm of the Bertaux to set a broken leg. Now
 from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across country by way
 of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior
 was afraid of accidents for her husband. So it was decided the stable-boy
 should go on first; Charles would start three hours later when the moon
 rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and show him the way to the farm,
 and open the gates for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards four o'clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his
 cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still sleepy from the warmth of his bed,
 he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. When it stopped
 of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are
 dug on the margin of furrows, Charles awoke with a start, suddenly
 remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures he
 knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the
 leafless trees birds roosted motionless, their little feathers bristling
 in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as eye could
 see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals seemed like
 dark violet stains on the cast grey surface, that on the horizon faded
 into the gloom of the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary, and, sleep
 coming upon him, he soon fell into a doze wherein, his recent sensations
 blending with memories, he became conscious of a double self, at once
 student and married man, lying in his bed as but now, and crossing the
 operation theatre as of old. The warm smell of poultices mingled in his
 brain with the fresh odour of dew; he heard the iron rings rattling along
 the curtain-rods of the bed and saw his wife sleeping. As he passed
 Vassonville he came upon a boy sitting on the grass at the edge of a
 ditch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you the doctor?" asked the child.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And on Charles's answer he took his wooden shoes in his hands and ran on
 in front of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide's talk
 that Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had broken his leg the evening before on his way home from a
 Twelfth-night feast at a neighbour's. His wife had been dead for two
 years. There was with him only his daughter, who helped him to keep house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ruts were becoming deeper; they were approaching the Bertaux.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little lad, slipping through a hole in the hedge, disappeared; then he
 came back to the end of a courtyard to open the gate. The horse slipped on
 the wet grass; Charles had to stoop to pass under the branches. The
 watchdogs in their kennels barked, dragging at their chains. As he entered
 the Bertaux, the horse took fright and stumbled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top of the
 open doors, one could see great cart-horses quietly feeding from new
 racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from which
 manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks,
 a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of it. The
 sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as your hand. Under
 the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with their whips,
 shafts and harnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool were getting
 soiled by the fine dust that fell from the granaries. The courtyard sloped
 upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically, and the chattering
 noise of a flock of geese was heard near the pond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to the
 threshold of the door to receive Monsieur Bovary, whom she led to the
 kitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant's breakfast was
 boiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some damp clothes were
 drying inside the chimney-corner. The shovel, tongs, and the nozzle of the
 bellows, all of colossal size, shone like polished steel, while along the
 walls hung many pots and pans in which the clear flame of the hearth,
 mingling with the first rays of the sun coming in through the window, was
 mirrored fitfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles went up the first floor to see the patient. He found him in his
 bed, sweating under his bed-clothes, having thrown his cotton nightcap
 right away from him. He was a fat little man of fifty, with white skin and
 blue eyes, the forepart of his head bald, and he wore earrings. By his
 side on a chair stood a large decanter of brandy, whence he poured himself
 a little from time to time to keep up his spirits; but as soon as he
 caught sight of the doctor his elation subsided, and instead of swearing,
 as he had been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan freely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to mind the
 devices of his masters at the bedsides of patients, he comforted the
 sufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those Caresses of the surgeon
 that are like the oil they put on bistouries. In order to make some
 splints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house. Charles
 selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment of
 windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and
 Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads. As she was a long time before
 she found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer,
 but as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth
 to suck them. Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her nails. They
 were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the ivory of Dieppe,
 and almond-shaped. Yet her hand was not beautiful, perhaps not white
 enough, and a little hard at the knuckles; besides, it was too long, with
 no soft inflections in the outlines. Her real beauty was in her eyes.
 Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and her look came
 at you frankly, with a candid boldness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault himself to
 "pick a bit" before he left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles went down into the room on the ground floor. Knives and forks and
 silver goblets were laid for two on a little table at the foot of a huge
 bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with figures representing Turks.
 There was an odour of iris-root and damp sheets that escaped from a large
 oak chest opposite the window. On the floor in corners were sacks of flour
 stuck upright in rows. These were the overflow from the neighbouring
 granary, to which three stone steps led. By way of decoration for the
 apartment, hanging to a nail in the middle of the wall, whose green paint
 scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre, was a crayon head of Minerva
 in gold frame, underneath which was written in Gothic letters "To dear
 Papa."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First they spoke of the patient, then of the weather, of the great cold,
 of the wolves that infested the fields at night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mademoiselle Rouault did not at all like the country, especially now that
 she had to look after the farm almost alone. As the room was chilly, she
 shivered as she ate. This showed something of her full lips, that she had
 a habit of biting when silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her neck stood out from a white turned-down collar. Her hair, whose two
 black folds seemed each of a single piece, so smooth were they, was parted
 in the middle by a delicate line that curved slightly with the curve of
 the head; and, just showing the tip of the ear, it was joined behind in a
 thick chignon, with a wavy movement at the temples that the country doctor
 saw now for the first time in his life. The upper part of her cheek was
 rose-coloured. She had, like a man, thrust in between two buttons of her
 bodice a tortoise-shell eyeglass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to the room
 before leaving, he found her standing, her forehead against the window,
 looking into the garden, where the bean props had been knocked down by the
 wind. She turned round. "Are you looking for anything?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My whip, if you please," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He began rummaging on the bed, behind the doors, under the chairs. It had
 fallen to the floor, between the sacks and the wall. Mademoiselle Emma saw
 it, and bent over the flour sacks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he stretched out his
 arm, at the same moment felt his breast brush against the back of the
 young girl bending beneath him. She drew herself up, scarlet, and looked
 at him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Instead of returning to the Bertaux in three days as he had promised, he
 went back the very next day, then regularly twice a week, without counting
 the visits he paid now and then as if by accident.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everything, moreover, went well; the patient progressed favourably; and
 when, at the end of forty-six days, old Rouault was seen trying to walk
 alone in his "den," Monsieur Bovary began to be looked upon as a man of
 great capacity. Old Rouault said that he could not have been cured better
 by the first doctor of Yvetot, or even of Rouen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure to him
 to go to the Bertaux. Had he done so, he would, no doubt, have attributed
 his zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the money he hoped
 to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm
 formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life? On
 these days he rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on his horse, then
 got down to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black gloves before
 entering. He liked going into the courtyard, and noticing the gate turn
 against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the lads run to meet him.
 He liked the granary and the stables; he liked old Rouault, who pressed
 his hand and called him his saviour; he like the small wooden shoes of
 Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the kitchen?her high heels
 made her a little taller; and when she walked in front of him, the wooden
 soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the leather
 of her boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She always accompanied him to the first step of the stairs. When his horse
 had not yet been brought round she stayed there. They had said "Good-bye";
 there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her round, playing with
 the soft down on the back of her neck, or blew to and fro on her hips the
 apron-strings, that fluttered like streamers. Once, during a thaw the bark
 of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on the roofs of the
 outbuildings was melting; she stood on the threshold, and went to fetch
 her sunshade and opened it. The sunshade of silk of the colour of pigeons'
 breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted up with shifting hues the
 white skin of her face. She smiled under the tender warmth, and drops of
 water could be heard falling one by one on the stretched silk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the first period of Charles's visits to the Bertaux, Madame Bovary
 junior never failed to inquire after the invalid, and she had even chosen
 in the book that she kept on a system of double entry a clean blank page
 for Monsieur Rouault. But when she heard he had a daughter, she began to
 make inquiries, and she learnt the Mademoiselle Rouault, brought up at the
 Ursuline Convent, had received what is called "a good education"; and so
 knew dancing, geography, drawing, how to embroider and play the piano.
 That was the last straw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So it is for this," she said to herself, "that his face beams when he
 goes to see her, and that he puts on his new waistcoat at the risk of
 spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! That woman!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she detested her instinctively. At first she solaced herself by
 allusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual observations
 that he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to which
 he knew not what to answer. "Why did he go back to the Bertaux now that
 Monsieur Rouault was cured and that these folks hadn't paid yet? Ah! it
 was because a young lady was there, some one who know how to talk, to
 embroider, to be witty. That was what he cared about; he wanted town
 misses." And she went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! Get out! Their grandfather was a
 shepherd, and they have a cousin who was almost had up at the assizes for
 a nasty blow in a quarrel. It is not worth while making such a fuss, or
 showing herself at church on Sundays in a silk gown like a countess.
 Besides, the poor old chap, if it hadn't been for the colza last year,
 would have had much ado to pay up his arrears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux. Heloise made him
 swear, his hand on the prayer-book, that he would go there no more after
 much sobbing and many kisses, in a great outburst of love. He obeyed then,
 but the strength of his desire protested against the servility of his
 conduct; and he thought, with a kind of naive hypocrisy, that his
 interdict to see her gave him a sort of right to love her. And then the
 widow was thin; she had long teeth; wore in all weathers a little black
 shawl, the edge of which hung down between her shoulder-blades; her bony
 figure was sheathed in her clothes as if they were a scabbard; they were
 too short, and displayed her ankles with the laces of her large boots
 crossed over grey stockings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles's mother came to see them from time to time, but after a few days
 the daughter-in-law seemed to put her own edge on her, and then, like two
 knives, they scarified him with their reflections and observations. It was
 wrong of him to eat so much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Why did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who came? What
 obstinacy not to wear flannels! In the spring it came about that a notary
 at Ingouville, the holder of the widow Dubuc's property, one fine day went
 off, taking with him all the money in his office. Heloise, it is true,
 still possessed, besides a share in a boat valued at six thousand francs,
 her house in the Rue St. Francois; and yet, with all this fortune that had
 been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting perhaps a little furniture
 and a few clothes, had appeared in the household. The matter had to be
 gone into. The house at Dieppe was found to be eaten up with mortgages to
 its foundations; what she had placed with the notary God only knew, and
 her share in the boat did not exceed one thousand crowns. She had lied,
 the good lady! In his exasperation, Monsieur Bovary the elder, smashing a
 chair on the flags, accused his wife of having caused misfortune to the
 son by harnessing him to such a harridan, whose harness wasn't worth her
 hide. They came to Tostes. Explanations followed. There were scenes.
 Heloise in tears, throwing her arms about her husband, implored him to
 defend her from his parents.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles tried to speak up for her. They grew angry and left the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But "the blow had struck home." A week after, as she was hanging up some
 washing in her yard, she was seized with a spitting of blood, and the next
 day, while Charles had his back turned to her drawing the window-curtain,
 she said, "O God!" gave a sigh and fainted. She was dead! What a surprise!
 When all was over at the cemetery Charles went home. He found no one
 downstairs; he went up to the first floor to their room; saw her dress
 still hanging at the foot of the alcove; then, leaning against the
 writing-table, he stayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful reverie.
 She had loved him after all!

 <h2>
 Chapter Three
 </h2>
 <p>
 One morning old Rouault brought Charles the money for setting his leg?seventy-five
 francs in forty-sou pieces, and a turkey. He had heard of his loss, and
 consoled him as well as he could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know what it is," said he, clapping him on the shoulder; "I've been
 through it. When I lost my dear departed, I went into the fields to be
 quite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried; I called on God; I
 talked nonsense to Him. I wanted to be like the moles that I saw on the
 branches, their insides swarming with worms, dead, and an end of it. And
 when I thought that there were others at that very moment with their nice
 little wives holding them in their embrace, I struck great blows on the
 earth with my stick. I was pretty well mad with not eating; the very idea
 of going to a cafe disgusted me?you wouldn't believe it. Well, quite
 softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter, and an autumn
 after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb; it passed
 away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for something always remains
 at the bottom as one would say?a weight here, at one's heart. But
 since it is the lot of all of us, one must not give way altogether, and,
 because others have died, want to die too. You must pull yourself
 together, Monsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see us; my daughter
 thinks of you now and again, d'ye know, and she says you are forgetting
 her. Spring will soon be here. We'll have some rabbit-shooting in the
 warrens to amuse you a bit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles followed his advice. He went back to the Bertaux. He found all as
 he had left it, that is to say, as it was five months ago. The pear trees
 were already in blossom, and Farmer Rouault, on his legs again, came and
 went, making the farm more full of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thinking it his duty to heap the greatest attention upon the doctor
 because of his sad position, he begged him not to take his hat off, spoke
 to him in an undertone as if he had been ill, and even pretended to be
 angry because nothing rather lighter had been prepared for him than for
 the others, such as a little clotted cream or stewed pears. He told
 stories. Charles found himself laughing, but the remembrance of his wife
 suddenly coming back to him depressed him. Coffee was brought in; he
 thought no more about her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thought less of her as he grew accustomed to living alone. The new
 delight of independence soon made his loneliness bearable. He could now
 change his meal-times, go in or out without explanation, and when he was
 very tired stretch himself at full length on his bed. So he nursed and
 coddled himself and accepted the consolations that were offered him. On
 the other hand, the death of his wife had not served him ill in his
 business, since for a month people had been saying, "The poor young man!
 what a loss!" His name had been talked about, his practice had increased;
 and moreover, he could go to the Bertaux just as he liked. He had an
 aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought himself better looking as
 he brushed his whiskers before the looking-glass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day he got there about three o'clock. Everybody was in the fields. He
 went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight of Emma; the
 outside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of the wood the sun sent
 across the flooring long fine rays that were broken at the corners of the
 furniture and trembled along the ceiling. Some flies on the table were
 crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as they drowned
 themselves in the dregs of the cider. The daylight that came in by the
 chimney made velvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and touched
 with blue the cold cinders. Between the window and the hearth Emma was
 sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of perspiration on her
 bare shoulders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After the fashion of country folks she asked him to have something to
 drink. He said no; she insisted, and at last laughingly offered to have a
 glass of liqueur with him. So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao from
 the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the brim,
 poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked
 glasses, carried hers to her mouth. As it was almost empty she bent back
 to drink, her head thrown back, her lips pouting, her neck on the strain.
 She laughed at getting none of it, while with the tip of her tongue
 passing between her small teeth she licked drop by drop the bottom of her
 glass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down again and took up her work, a white cotton stocking she was
 darning. She worked with her head bent down; she did not speak, nor did
 Charles. The air coming in under the door blew a little dust over the
 flags; he watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing in
 his head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard.
 Emma from time to time cooled her cheeks with the palms of her hands, and
 cooled these again on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She complained of suffering since the beginning of the season from
 giddiness; she asked if sea-baths would do her any good; she began talking
 of her convent, Charles of his school; words came to them. They went up
 into her bedroom. She showed him her old music-books, the little prizes
 she had won, and the oak-leaf crowns, left at the bottom of a cupboard.
 She spoke to him, too, of her mother, of the country, and even showed him
 the bed in the garden where, on the first Friday of every month, she
 gathered flowers to put on her mother's tomb. But the gardener they had
 never knew anything about it; servants are so stupid! She would have
 dearly liked, if only for the winter, to live in town, although the length
 of the fine days made the country perhaps even more wearisome in the
 summer. And, according to what she was saying, her voice was clear, sharp,
 or, on a sudden all languor, drawn out in modulations that ended almost in
 murmurs as she spoke to herself, now joyous, opening big naive eyes, then
 with her eyelids half closed, her look full of boredom, her thoughts
 wandering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Going home at night, Charles went over her words one by one, trying to
 recall them, to fill out their sense, that he might piece out the life she
 had lived before he knew her. But he never saw her in his thoughts other
 than he had seen her the first time, or as he had just left her. Then he
 asked himself what would become of her?if she would be married, and
 to whom! Alas! Old Rouault was rich, and she!?so beautiful! But
 Emma's face always rose before his eyes, and a monotone, like the humming
 of a top, sounded in his ears, "If you should marry after all! If you
 should marry!" At night he could not sleep; his throat was parched; he was
 athirst. He got up to drink from the water-bottle and opened the window.
 The night was covered with stars, a warm wind blowing in the distance; the
 dogs were barking. He turned his head towards the Bertaux.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thinking that, after all, he should lose nothing, Charles promised himself
 to ask her in marriage as soon as occasion offered, but each time such
 occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words sealed his
 lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Old Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was
 of no use to him in the house. In his heart he excused her, thinking her
 too clever for farming, a calling under the ban of Heaven, since one never
 saw a millionaire in it. Far from having made a fortune by it, the good
 man was losing every year; for if he was good in bargaining, in which he
 enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand, agriculture properly
 so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him less than
 most people. He did not willingly take his hands out of his pockets, and
 did not spare expense in all that concerned himself, liking to eat well,
 to have good fires, and to sleep well. He liked old cider, underdone legs
 of mutton, glorias* well beaten up. He took his meals in the kitchen
 alone, opposite the fire, on a little table brought to him all ready laid
 as on the stage.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *A mixture of coffee and spirits.
</pre>
 <p>
 When, therefore, he perceived that Charles's cheeks grew red if near his
 daughter, which meant that he would propose for her one of these days, he
 chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He certainly thought him a little
 meagre, and not quite the son-in-law he would have liked, but he was said
 to be well brought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt would not
 make too many difficulties about the dowry. Now, as old Rouault would soon
 be forced to sell twenty-two acres of "his property," as he owed a good
 deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as the shaft of the
 cider-press wanted renewing, "If he asks for her," he said to himself,
 "I'll give her to him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At Michaelmas Charles went to spend three days at the Bertaux.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The last had passed like the others in procrastinating from hour to hour.
 Old Rouault was seeing him off; they were walking along the road full of
 ruts; they were about to part. This was the time. Charles gave himself as
 far as to the corner of the hedge, and at last, when past it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Rouault," he murmured, "I should like to say something to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stopped. Charles was silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, tell me your story. Don't I know all about it?" said old Rouault,
 laughing softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Rouault?Monsieur Rouault," stammered Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ask nothing better", the farmer went on. "Although, no doubt, the
 little one is of my mind, still we must ask her opinion. So you get off?I'll
 go back home. If it is 'yes', you needn't return because of all the people
 about, and besides it would upset her too much. But so that you mayn't be
 eating your heart, I'll open wide the outer shutter of the window against
 the wall; you can see it from the back by leaning over the hedge."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he went off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles fastened his horse to a tree; he ran into the road and waited.
 Half an hour passed, then he counted nineteen minutes by his watch.
 Suddenly a noise was heard against the wall; the shutter had been thrown
 back; the hook was still swinging.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day by nine o'clock he was at the farm. Emma blushed as he
 entered, and she gave a little forced laugh to keep herself in
 countenance. Old Rouault embraced his future son-in-law. The discussion of
 money matters was put off; moreover, there was plenty of time before them,
 as the marriage could not decently take place till Charles was out of
 mourning, that is to say, about the spring of the next year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The winter passed waiting for this. Mademoiselle Rouault was busy with her
 trousseau. Part of it was ordered at Rouen, and she made herself chemises
 and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she borrowed. When Charles visited
 the farmer, the preparations for the wedding were talked over; they
 wondered in what room they should have dinner; they dreamed of the number
 of dishes that would be wanted, and what should be entrees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight wedding
 with torches, but old Rouault could not understand such an idea. So there
 was a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at which they
 remained sixteen hours at table, began again the next day, and to some
 extent on the days following.

 <h2>
 Chapter Four
 </h2>
 <p>
 The guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled
 cars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods, and the young people
 from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in rows, holding
 on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot and well shaken up.
 Some came from a distance of thirty miles, from Goderville, from
 Normanville, and from Cany.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the relatives of both families had been invited, quarrels between
 friends arranged, acquaintances long since lost sight of written to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From time to time one heard the crack of a whip behind the hedge; then the
 gates opened, a chaise entered. Galloping up to the foot of the steps, it
 stopped short and emptied its load. They got down from all sides, rubbing
 knees and stretching arms. The ladies, wearing bonnets, had on dresses in
 the town fashion, gold watch chains, pelerines with the ends tucked into
 belts, or little coloured fichus fastened down behind with a pin, and that
 left the back of the neck bare. The lads, dressed like their papas, seemed
 uncomfortable in their new clothes (many that day hand-sewed their first
 pair of boots), and by their sides, speaking never a work, wearing the
 white dress of their first communion lengthened for the occasion were some
 big girls of fourteen or sixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt,
 rubicund, bewildered, their hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much
 afraid of dirtying their gloves. As there were not enough stable-boys to
 unharness all the carriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set
 about it themselves. According to their different social positions they
 wore tail-coats, overcoats, shooting jackets, cutaway-coats; fine
 tail-coats, redolent of family respectability, that only came out of the
 wardrobe on state occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the
 wind and round capes and pockets like sacks; shooting jackets of coarse
 cloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak; very short
 cutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back, close together like a
 pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed cut out of one piece by a
 carpenter's hatchet. Some, too (but these, you may be sure, would sit at
 the bottom of the table), wore their best blouses?that is to say,
 with collars turned down to the shoulders, the back gathered into small
 plaits and the waist fastened very low down with a worked belt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! Everyone had just
 had his hair cut; ears stood out from the heads; they had been
 close-shaved; a few, even, who had had to get up before daybreak, and not
 been able to see to shave, had diagonal gashes under their noses or cuts
 the size of a three-franc piece along the jaws, which the fresh air en
 route had enflamed, so that the great white beaming faces were mottled
 here and there with red dabs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mairie was a mile and a half from the farm, and they went thither on
 foot, returning in the same way after the ceremony in the church. The
 procession, first united like one long coloured scarf that undulated
 across the fields, along the narrow path winding amid the green corn, soon
 lengthened out, and broke up into different groups that loitered to talk.
 The fiddler walked in front with his violin, gay with ribbons at its pegs.
 Then came the married pair, the relations, the friends, all following
 pell-mell; the children stayed behind amusing themselves plucking the
 bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves unseen. Emma's
 dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from time to time she
 stopped to pull it up, and then delicately, with her gloved hands, she
 picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns, while Charles, empty
 handed, waited till she had finished. Old Rouault, with a new silk hat and
 the cuffs of his black coat covering his hands up to the nails, gave his
 arm to Madame Bovary senior. As to Monsieur Bovary senior, who, heartily
 despising all these folk, had come simply in a frock-coat of military cut
 with one row of buttons?he was passing compliments of the bar to a
 fair young peasant. She bowed, blushed, and did not know what to say. The
 other wedding guests talked of their business or played tricks behind each
 other's backs, egging one another on in advance to be jolly. Those who
 listened could always catch the squeaking of the fiddler, who went on
 playing across the fields. When he saw that the rest were far behind he
 stopped to take breath, slowly rosined his bow, so that the strings should
 sound more shrilly, then set off again, by turns lowering and raising his
 neck, the better to mark time for himself. The noise of the instrument
 drove away the little birds from afar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The table was laid under the cart-shed. On it were four sirloins, six
 chicken fricassees, stewed veal, three legs of mutton, and in the middle a
 fine roast suckling pig, flanked by four chitterlings with sorrel. At the
 corners were decanters of brandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round the
 corks, and all the glasses had been filled to the brim with wine
 beforehand. Large dishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least
 shake of the table, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of
 the newly wedded pair in nonpareil arabesques. A confectioner of Yvetot
 had been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. As he had only just set up
 on the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he himself
 brought in a set dish that evoked loud cries of wonderment. To begin with,
 at its base there was a square of blue cardboard, representing a temple
 with porticoes, colonnades, and stucco statuettes all round, and in the
 niches constellations of gilt paper stars; then on the second stage was a
 dungeon of Savoy cake, surrounded by many fortifications in candied
 angelica, almonds, raisins, and quarters of oranges; and finally, on the
 upper platform a green field with rocks set in lakes of jam, nutshell
 boats, and a small Cupid balancing himself in a chocolate swing whose two
 uprights ended in real roses for balls at the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Until night they ate. When any of them were too tired of sitting, they
 went out for a stroll in the yard, or for a game with corks in the
 granary, and then returned to table. Some towards the finish went to sleep
 and snored. But with the coffee everyone woke up. Then they began songs,
 showed off tricks, raised heavy weights, performed feats with their
 fingers, then tried lifting carts on their shoulders, made broad jokes,
 kissed the women. At night when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the
 nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they kicked,
 reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and all night
 in the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway carts at
 full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over yard after yard of
 stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning out from the tilt to
 catch hold of the reins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen.
 The children had fallen asleep under the seats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bride had begged her father to be spared the usual marriage
 pleasantries. However, a fishmonger, one of their cousins (who had even
 brought a pair of soles for his wedding present), began to squirt water
 from his mouth through the keyhole, when old Rouault came up just in time
 to stop him, and explain to him that the distinguished position of his
 son-in-law would not allow of such liberties. The cousin all the same did
 not give in to these reasons readily. In his heart he accused old Rouault
 of being proud, and he joined four or five other guests in a corner, who
 having, through mere chance, been several times running served with the
 worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been badly used, and
 were whispering about their host, and with covered hints hoping he would
 ruin himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had been
 consulted neither as to the dress of her daughter-in-law nor as to the
 arrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her husband, instead of
 following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till
 daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a mixture unknown to the company. This
 added greatly to the consideration in which he was held.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding. He
 answered feebly to the puns, doubles entendres*, compliments, and chaff
 that it was felt a duty to let off at him as soon as the soup appeared.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Double meanings.
</pre>
 <p>
 The next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he who
 might rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening before, whilst
 the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did not know
 what to make of it, and they looked at her when she passed near them with
 an unbounded concentration of mind. But Charles concealed nothing. He
 called her "my wife", tutoyed* her, asked for her of everyone, looked for
 her everywhere, and often he dragged her into the yards, where he could be
 seen from far between the trees, putting his arm around her waist, and
 walking half-bending over her, ruffling the chemisette of her bodice with
 his head.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Used the familiar form of address.
</pre>
 <p>
 Two days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of
 his patients, could not be away longer. Old Rouault had them driven back
 in his cart, and himself accompanied them as far as Vassonville. Here he
 embraced his daughter for the last time, got down, and went his way. When
 he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart
 disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he
 remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his wife;
 he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father
 to his home, and had carried her off on a pillion, trotting through the
 snow, for it was near Christmas-time, and the country was all white. She
 held him by one arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the
 long lace of her Cauchois headdress so that it sometimes flapped across
 his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw near him, on his shoulder,
 her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap. To
 warm her hands she put them from time to time in his breast. How long ago
 it all was! Their son would have been thirty by now. Then he looked back
 and saw nothing on the road. He felt dreary as an empty house; and tender
 memories mingling with the sad thoughts in his brain, addled by the fumes
 of the feast, he felt inclined for a moment to take a turn towards the
 church. As he was afraid, however, that this sight would make him yet more
 sad, he went right away home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes about six o'clock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The neighbors came to the windows to see their doctor's new wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised for not
 having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should
 look over her house.

 <h2>
 Chapter Five
 </h2>
 <p>
 The brick front was just in a line with the street, or rather the road.
 Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar, a bridle, and a black
 leather cap, and on the floor, in a corner, were a pair of leggings, still
 covered with dry mud. On the right was the one apartment, that was both
 dining and sitting room. A canary yellow paper, relieved at the top by a
 garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched
 canvas; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the
 length of the window; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of
 Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks under oval
 shades. On the other side of the passage was Charles's consulting room, a
 little room about six paces wide, with a table, three chairs, and an
 office chair. Volumes of the "Dictionary of Medical Science," uncut, but
 the binding rather the worse for the successive sales through which they
 had gone, occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he saw
 patients, just as in the kitchen one could hear the people coughing in the
 consulting room and recounting their histories.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, opening on the yard, where the stable was, came a large dilapidated
 room with a stove, now used as a wood-house, cellar, and pantry, full of
 old rubbish, of empty casks, agricultural implements past service, and a
 mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to guess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with espaliered
 apricots, to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field. In the
 middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal; four flower beds with
 eglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed.
 Right at the bottom, under the spruce bushes, was a cure in plaster
 reading his breviary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma went upstairs. The first room was not furnished, but in the second,
 which was their bedroom, was a mahogany bedstead in an alcove with red
 drapery. A shell box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary
 near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons
 stood in a bottle. It was a bride's bouquet; it was the other one's. She
 looked at it. Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the
 attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting her things
 down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and
 wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she were to die.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the first days she occupied herself in thinking about changes in
 the house. She took the shades off the candlesticks, had new wallpaper put
 up, the staircase repainted, and seats made in the garden round the
 sundial; she even inquired how she could get a basin with a jet fountain
 and fishes. Finally her husband, knowing that she liked to drive out,
 picked up a second-hand dogcart, which, with new lamps and splashboard in
 striped leather, looked almost like a tilbury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was happy then, and without a care in the world. A meal together, a
 walk in the evening on the highroad, a gesture of her hands over her hair,
 the sight of her straw hat hanging from the window-fastener, and many
 another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure, now made up
 the endless round of his happiness. In bed, in the morning, by her side,
 on the pillow, he watched the sunlight sinking into the down on her fair
 cheek, half hidden by the lappets of her night-cap. Seen thus closely, her
 eyes looked to him enlarged, especially when, on waking up, she opened and
 shut them rapidly many times. Black in the shade, dark blue in broad
 daylight, they had, as it were, depths of different colours, that, darker
 in the centre, grew paler towards the surface of the eye. His own eyes
 lost themselves in these depths; he saw himself in miniature down to the
 shoulders, with his handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt
 open. He rose. She came to the window to see him off, and stayed leaning
 on the sill between two pots of geranium, clad in her dressing gown
 hanging loosely about her. Charles, in the street buckled his spurs, his
 foot on the mounting stone, while she talked to him from above, picking
 with her mouth some scrap of flower or leaf that she blew out at him. Then
 this, eddying, floating, described semicircles in the air like a bird, and
 was caught before it reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old
 white mare standing motionless at the door. Charles from horseback threw
 her a kiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the window, and he set off.
 And then along the highroad, spreading out its long ribbon of dust, along
 the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours, along paths where
 the corn reached to the knees, with the sun on his back and the morning
 air in his nostrils, his heart full of the joys of the past night, his
 mind at rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his happiness,
 like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are
 digesting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Until now what good had he had of his life? His time at school, when he
 remained shut up within the high walls, alone, in the midst of companions
 richer than he or cleverer at their work, who laughed at his accent, who
 jeered at his clothes, and whose mothers came to the school with cakes in
 their muffs? Later on, when he studied medicine, and never had his purse
 full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have become his
 mistress? Afterwards, he had lived fourteen months with the widow, whose
 feet in bed were cold as icicles. But now he had for life this beautiful
 woman whom he adored. For him the universe did not extend beyond the
 circumference of her petticoat, and he reproached himself with not loving
 her. He wanted to see her again; he turned back quickly, ran up the stairs
 with a beating heart. Emma, in her room, was dressing; he came up on
 tiptoe, kissed her back; she gave a cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He could not keep from constantly touching her comb, her ring, her fichu;
 sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all his mouth on her
 cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm from the tip
 of her fingers up to her shoulder, and she put him away half-smiling,
 half-vexed, as you do a child who hangs about you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before marriage she thought herself in love; but the happiness that should
 have followed this love not having come, she must, she thought, have been
 mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in life by the
 words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her so beautiful in
 books.

 <h2>
 Chapter Six
 </h2>
 <p>
 She had read "Paul and Virginia," and she had dreamed of the little
 bamboo-house, the nigger Domingo, the dog Fidele, but above all of the
 sweet friendship of some dear little brother, who seeks red fruit for you
 on trees taller than steeples, or who runs barefoot over the sand,
 bringing you a bird's nest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she was thirteen, her father himself took her to town to place her in
 the convent. They stopped at an inn in the St. Gervais quarter, where, at
 their supper, they used painted plates that set forth the story of
 Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The explanatory legends, chipped here and
 there by the scratching of knives, all glorified religion, the
 tendernesses of the heart, and the pomps of court.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Far from being bored at first at the convent, she took pleasure in the
 society of the good sisters, who, to amuse her, took her to the chapel,
 which one entered from the refectory by a long corridor. She played very
 little during recreation hours, knew her catechism well, and it was she
 who always answered Monsieur le Vicaire's difficult questions. Living
 thus, without every leaving the warm atmosphere of the classrooms, and
 amid these pale-faced women wearing rosaries with brass crosses, she was
 softly lulled by the mystic languor exhaled in the perfumes of the altar,
 the freshness of the holy water, and the lights of the tapers. Instead of
 attending to mass, she looked at the pious vignettes with their azure
 borders in her book, and she loved the sick lamb, the sacred heart pierced
 with sharp arrows, or the poor Jesus sinking beneath the cross he carries.
 She tried, by way of mortification, to eat nothing a whole day. She
 puzzled her head to find some vow to fulfil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she went to confession, she invented little sins in order that she
 might stay there longer, kneeling in the shadow, her hands joined, her
 face against the grating beneath the whispering of the priest. The
 comparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial lover, and eternal marriage,
 that recur in sermons, stirred within her soul depths of unexpected
 sweetness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the evening, before prayers, there was some religious reading in the
 study. On week-nights it was some abstract of sacred history or the
 Lectures of the Abbe Frayssinous, and on Sundays passages from the "Genie
 du Christianisme," as a recreation. How she listened at first to the
 sonorous lamentations of its romantic melancholies reechoing through the
 world and eternity! If her childhood had been spent in the shop-parlour of
 some business quarter, she might perhaps have opened her heart to those
 lyrical invasions of Nature, which usually come to us only through
 translation in books. But she knew the country too well; she knew the
 lowing of cattle, the milking, the ploughs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Accustomed to calm aspects of life, she turned, on the contrary, to those
 of excitement. She loved the sea only for the sake of its storms, and the
 green fields only when broken up by ruins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she rejected as
 useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her heart,
 being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking for
 emotions, not landscapes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the convent there was an old maid who came for a week each month to
 mend the linen. Patronized by the clergy, because she belonged to an
 ancient family of noblemen ruined by the Revolution, she dined in the
 refectory at the table of the good sisters, and after the meal had a bit
 of chat with them before going back to her work. The girls often slipped
 out from the study to go and see her. She knew by heart the love songs of
 the last century, and sang them in a low voice as she stitched away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She told stories, gave them news, went errands in the town, and on the sly
 lent the big girls some novel, that she always carried in the pockets of
 her apron, and of which the good lady herself swallowed long chapters in
 the intervals of her work. They were all love, lovers, sweethearts,
 persecuted ladies fainting in lonely pavilions, postilions killed at every
 stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre forests, heartaches,
 vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by moonlight, nightingales in
 shady groves, "gentlemen" brave as lions, gentle as lambs, virtuous as no
 one ever was, always well dressed, and weeping like fountains. For six
 months, then, Emma, at fifteen years of age, made her hands dirty with
 books from old lending libraries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Through Walter Scott, later on, she fell in love with historical events,
 dreamed of old chests, guard-rooms and minstrels. She would have liked to
 live in some old manor-house, like those long-waisted chatelaines who, in
 the shade of pointed arches, spent their days leaning on the stone, chin
 in hand, watching a cavalier with white plume galloping on his black horse
 from the distant fields. At this time she had a cult for Mary Stuart and
 enthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy women. Joan of Arc,
 Heloise, Agnes Sorel, the beautiful Ferroniere, and Clemence Isaure stood
 out to her like comets in the dark immensity of heaven, where also were
 seen, lost in shadow, and all unconnected, St. Louis with his oak, the
 dying Bayard, some cruelties of Louis XI, a little of St. Bartholomew's
 Day, the plume of the Bearnais, and always the remembrance of the plates
 painted in honour of Louis XIV.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the music class, in the ballads she sang, there was nothing but little
 angels with golden wings, madonnas, lagunes, gondoliers;-mild compositions
 that allowed her to catch a glimpse athwart the obscurity of style and the
 weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria of sentimental
 realities. Some of her companions brought "keepsakes" given them as new
 year's gifts to the convent. These had to be hidden; it was quite an
 undertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately handling the
 beautiful satin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at the names of
 the unknown authors, who had signed their verses for the most part as
 counts or viscounts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She trembled as she blew back the tissue paper over the engraving and saw
 it folded in two and fall gently against the page. Here behind the
 balustrade of a balcony was a young man in a short cloak, holding in his
 arms a young girl in a white dress wearing an alms-bag at her belt; or
 there were nameless portraits of English ladies with fair curls, who
 looked at you from under their round straw hats with their large clear
 eyes. Some there were lounging in their carriages, gliding through parks,
 a greyhound bounding along in front of the equipage driven at a trot by
 two midget postilions in white breeches. Others, dreaming on sofas with an
 open letter, gazed at the moon through a slightly open window half draped
 by a black curtain. The naive ones, a tear on their cheeks, were kissing
 doves through the bars of a Gothic cage, or, smiling, their heads on one
 side, were plucking the leaves of a marguerite with their taper fingers,
 that curved at the tips like peaked shoes. And you, too, were there,
 Sultans with long pipes reclining beneath arbours in the arms of
 Bayaderes; Djiaours, Turkish sabres, Greek caps; and you especially, pale
 landscapes of dithyrambic lands, that often show us at once palm trees and
 firs, tigers on the right, a lion to the left, Tartar minarets on the
 horizon; the whole framed by a very neat virgin forest, and with a great
 perpendicular sunbeam trembling in the water, where, standing out in
 relief like white excoriations on a steel-grey ground, swans are swimming
 about.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the shade of the argand lamp fastened to the wall above Emma's head
 lighted up all these pictures of the world, that passed before her one by
 one in the silence of the dormitory, and to the distant noise of some
 belated carriage rolling over the Boulevards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When her mother died she cried much the first few days. She had a funeral
 picture made with the hair of the deceased, and, in a letter sent to the
 Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she asked to be buried later on
 in the same grave. The goodman thought she must be ill, and came to see
 her. Emma was secretly pleased that she had reached at a first attempt the
 rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre hearts. She let
 herself glide along with Lamartine meanderings, listened to harps on
 lakes, to all the songs of dying swans, to the falling of the leaves, the
 pure virgins ascending to heaven, and the voice of the Eternal discoursing
 down the valleys. She wearied of it, would not confess it, continued from
 habit, and at last was surprised to feel herself soothed, and with no more
 sadness at heart than wrinkles on her brow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The good nuns, who had been so sure of her vocation, perceived with great
 astonishment that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to be slipping from them.
 They had indeed been so lavish to her of prayers, retreats, novenas, and
 sermons, they had so often preached the respect due to saints and martyrs,
 and given so much good advice as to the modesty of the body and the
 salvation of her soul, that she did as tightly reined horses; she pulled
 up short and the bit slipped from her teeth. This nature, positive in the
 midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for the sake of the
 flowers, and music for the words of the songs, and literature for its
 passional stimulus, rebelled against the mysteries of faith as it grew
 irritated by discipline, a thing antipathetic to her constitution. When
 her father took her from school, no one was sorry to see her go. The Lady
 Superior even thought that she had latterly been somewhat irreverent to
 the community.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the
 servants, then grew disgusted with the country and missed her convent.
 When Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she thought herself
 quite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn, and nothing more to feel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the uneasiness of her new position, or perhaps the disturbance caused
 by the presence of this man, had sufficed to make her believe that she at
 last felt that wondrous passion which, till then, like a great bird with
 rose-coloured wings, hung in the splendour of the skies of poesy; and now
 she could not think that the calm in which she lived was the happiness she
 had dreamed.

 <h2>
 Chapter Seven
 </h2>
 <p>
 She thought, sometimes, that, after all, this was the happiest time of her
 life?the honeymoon, as people called it. To taste the full sweetness
 of it, it would have been necessary doubtless to fly to those lands with
 sonorous names where the days after marriage are full of laziness most
 suave. In post chaises behind blue silken curtains to ride slowly up steep
 road, listening to the song of the postilion re-echoed by the mountains,
 along with the bells of goats and the muffled sound of a waterfall; at
 sunset on the shores of gulfs to breathe in the perfume of lemon trees;
 then in the evening on the villa-terraces above, hand in hand to look at
 the stars, making plans for the future. It seemed to her that certain
 places on earth must bring happiness, as a plant peculiar to the soil, and
 that cannot thrive elsewhere. Why could not she lean over balconies in
 Swiss chalets, or enshrine her melancholy in a Scotch cottage, with a
 husband dressed in a black velvet coat with long tails, and thin shoes, a
 pointed hat and frills? Perhaps she would have liked to confide all these
 things to someone. But how tell an undefinable uneasiness, variable as the
 clouds, unstable as the winds? Words failed her?the opportunity, the
 courage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If Charles had but wished it, if he had guessed it, if his look had but
 once met her thought, it seemed to her that a sudden plenty would have
 gone out from her heart, as the fruit falls from a tree when shaken by a
 hand. But as the intimacy of their life became deeper, the greater became
 the gulf that separated her from him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and
 everyone's ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb, without
 exciting emotion, laughter, or thought. He had never had the curiosity, he
 said, while he lived at Rouen, to go to the theatre to see the actors from
 Paris. He could neither swim, nor fence, nor shoot, and one day he could
 not explain some term of horsemanship to her that she had come across in a
 novel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold
 activities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements of
 life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing, wished
 nothing. He thought her happy; and she resented this easy calm, this
 serene heaviness, the very happiness she gave him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes she would draw; and it was great amusement to Charles to stand
 there bolt upright and watch her bend over her cardboard, with eyes
 half-closed the better to see her work, or rolling, between her fingers,
 little bread-pellets. As to the piano, the more quickly her fingers glided
 over it the more he wondered. She struck the notes with aplomb, and ran
 from top to bottom of the keyboard without a break. Thus shaken up, the
 old instrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the other end of
 the village when the window was open, and often the bailiff's clerk,
 passing along the highroad bare-headed and in list slippers, stopped to
 listen, his sheet of paper in his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She sent the
 patients' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no suggestion of a
 bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays, she managed to have
 some tasty dish?piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves,
 served up preserves turned out into plates?and even spoke of buying
 finger-glasses for dessert. From all this much consideration was extended
 to Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles finished by rising in his own esteem for possessing such a wife.
 He showed with pride in the sitting room two small pencil sketches by her
 that he had had framed in very large frames, and hung up against the
 wallpaper by long green cords. People returning from mass saw him at his
 door in his wool-work slippers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came home late?at ten o'clock, at midnight sometimes. Then he
 asked for something to eat, and as the servant had gone to bed, Emma
 waited on him. He took off his coat to dine more at his ease. He told her,
 one after the other, the people he had met, the villages where he had
 been, the prescriptions he had written, and, well pleased with himself, he
 finished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked pieces off
 the cheese, munched an apple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to
 bed, and lay on his back and snored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his handkerchief
 would not keep down over his ears, so that his hair in the morning was all
 tumbled pell-mell about his face and whitened with the feathers of the
 pillow, whose strings came untied during the night. He always wore thick
 boots that had two long creases over the instep running obliquely towards
 the ankle, while the rest of the upper continued in a straight line as if
 stretched on a wooden foot. He said that "was quite good enough for the
 country."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother approved of his economy, for she came to see him as formerly
 when there had been some violent row at her place; and yet Madame Bovary
 senior seemed prejudiced against her daughter-in-law. She thought "her
 ways too fine for their position"; the wood, the sugar, and the candles
 disappeared as "at a grand establishment," and the amount of firing in the
 kitchen would have been enough for twenty-five courses. She put her linen
 in order for her in the presses, and taught her to keep an eye on the
 butcher when he brought the meat. Emma put up with these lessons. Madame
 Bovary was lavish of them; and the words "daughter" and "mother" were
 exchanged all day long, accompanied by little quiverings of the lips, each
 one uttering gentle words in a voice trembling with anger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In Madame Dubuc's time the old woman felt that she was still the favorite;
 but now the love of Charles for Emma seemed to her a desertion from her
 tenderness, an encroachment upon what was hers, and she watched her son's
 happiness in sad silence, as a ruined man looks through the windows at
 people dining in his old house. She recalled to him as remembrances her
 troubles and her sacrifices, and, comparing these with Emma's negligence,
 came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to adore her so
 exclusively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he loved his
 wife infinitely; he considered the judgment of the one infallible, and yet
 he thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. When Madam Bovary had
 gone, he tried timidly and in the same terms to hazard one or two of the
 more anodyne observations he had heard from his mamma. Emma proved to him
 with a word that he was mistaken, and sent him off to his patients.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet, in accord with theories she believed right, she wanted to make
 herself in love with him. By moonlight in the garden she recited all the
 passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him many
 melancholy adagios; but she found herself as calm after as before, and
 Charles seemed no more amorous and no more moved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she had thus for a while struck the flint on her heart without
 getting a spark, incapable, moreover, of understanding what she did not
 experience as of believing anything that did not present itself in
 conventional forms, she persuaded herself without difficulty that
 Charles's passion was nothing very exorbitant. His outbursts became
 regular; he embraced her at certain fixed times. It was one habit among
 other habits, and, like a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony of
 dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs, had given
 madame a little Italian greyhound; she took her out walking, for she went
 out sometimes in order to be alone for a moment, and not to see before her
 eyes the eternal garden and the dusty road. She went as far as the beeches
 of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall
 on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of the ditch there are
 long reeds with leaves that cut you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She began by looking round her to see if nothing had changed since last
 she had been there. She found again in the same places the foxgloves and
 wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and the
 patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always closed,
 were rotting away on their rusty iron bars. Her thoughts, aimless at
 first, wandered at random, like her greyhound, who ran round and round in
 the fields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing the shrew-mice,
 or nibbling the poppies on the edge of a cornfield.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then gradually her ideas took definite shape, and, sitting on the grass
 that she dug up with little prods of her sunshade, Emma repeated to
 herself, "Good heavens! Why did I marry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not
 been possible to meet another man; and she tried to imagine what would
 have been these unrealised events, this different life, this unknown
 husband. All, surely, could not be like this one. He might have been
 handsome, witty, distinguished, attractive, such as, no doubt, her old
 companions of the convent had married. What were they doing now? In town,
 with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the lights of
 the ballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands, the senses
 bourgeon out. But she?her life was cold as a garret whose dormer
 window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was weaving its
 web in the darkness in every corner of her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She recalled the prize days, when she mounted the platform to receive her
 little crowns, with her hair in long plaits. In her white frock and open
 prunella shoes she had a pretty way, and when she went back to her seat,
 the gentlemen bent over her to congratulate her; the courtyard was full of
 carriages; farewells were called to her through their windows; the music
 master with his violin case bowed in passing by. How far all of this! How
 far away! She called Djali, took her between her knees, and smoothed the
 long delicate head, saying, "Come, kiss mistress; you have no troubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal, who yawned slowly,
 she softened, and comparing her to herself, spoke to her aloud as to
 somebody in trouble whom one is consoling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Occasionally there came gusts of winds, breezes from the sea rolling in
 one sweep over the whole plateau of the Caux country, which brought even
 to these fields a salt freshness. The rushes, close to the ground,
 whistled; the branches trembled in a swift rustling, while their summits,
 ceaselessly swaying, kept up a deep murmur. Emma drew her shawl round her
 shoulders and rose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the avenue a green light dimmed by the leaves lit up the short moss
 that crackled softly beneath her feet. The sun was setting; the sky showed
 red between the branches, and the trunks of the trees, uniform, and
 planted in a straight line, seemed a brown colonnade standing out against
 a background of gold. A fear took hold of her; she called Djali, and
 hurriedly returned to Tostes by the high road, threw herself into an
 armchair, and for the rest of the evening did not speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But towards the end of September something extraordinary fell upon her
 life; she was invited by the Marquis d'Andervilliers to Vaubyessard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Secretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to re-enter
 political life, set about preparing for his candidature to the Chamber of
 Deputies long beforehand. In the winter he distributed a great deal of
 wood, and in the Conseil General always enthusiastically demanded new
 roads for his arrondissement. During the dog-days he had suffered from an
 abscess, which Charles had cured as if by miracle by giving a timely
 little touch with the lancet. The steward sent to Tostes to pay for the
 operation reported in the evening that he had seen some superb cherries in
 the doctor's little garden. Now cherry trees did not thrive at
 Vaubyessard; the Marquis asked Bovary for some slips; made it his business
 to thank his personally; saw Emma; thought she had a pretty figure, and
 that she did not bow like a peasant; so that he did not think he was going
 beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other hand, making a
 mistake, in inviting the young couple.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in their
 dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped on behind
 and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these Charles held a
 bandbox between his knees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They arrived at nightfall, just as the lamps in the park were being lit to
 show the way for the carriages.

 <h2>
 Chapter Eight
 </h2>
 <p>
 The chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting wings
 and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense green-sward, on
 which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees set out at
 regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas,
 and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of green along the
 curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through the mist
 one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over the
 field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered hillocks, and in the
 background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines the coach houses and
 stables, all that was left of the ruined old chateau.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles's dog-cart pulled up before the middle flight of steps; servants
 appeared; the Marquis came forward, and, offering his arm to the doctor's
 wife, conducted her to the vestibule.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was paved with marble slabs, was very lofty, and the sound of footsteps
 and that of voices re-echoed through it as in a church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Opposite rose a straight staircase, and on the left a gallery overlooking
 the garden led to the billiard room, through whose door one could hear the
 click of the ivory balls. As she crossed it to go to the drawing room,
 Emma saw standing round the table men with grave faces, their chins
 resting on high cravats. They all wore orders, and smiled silently as they
 made their strokes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at the bottom
 names written in black letters. She read: "Jean-Antoine d'Andervilliers
 d'Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la Fresnay, killed at
 the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October, 1587." And on another:
 "Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d'Andervilliers de la Vaubyessard, Admiral of
 France and Chevalier of the Order of St. Michael, wounded at the battle of
 the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of May, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on
 the 23rd of January 1693." One could hardly make out those that followed,
 for the light of the lamps lowered over the green cloth threw a dim shadow
 round the room. Burnishing the horizontal pictures, it broke up against
 these in delicate lines where there were cracks in the varnish, and from
 all these great black squares framed in with gold stood out here and there
 some lighter portion of the painting?a pale brow, two eyes that
 looked at you, perukes flowing over and powdering red-coated shoulders, or
 the buckle of a garter above a well-rounded calf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies (the
 Marchioness herself) came to meet Emma. She made her sit down by her on an
 ottoman, and began talking to her as amicably as if she had known her a
 long time. She was a woman of about forty, with fine shoulders, a hook
 nose, a drawling voice, and on this evening she wore over her brown hair a
 simple guipure fichu that fell in a point at the back. A fair young woman
 sat in a high-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers in
 their buttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At seven dinner was served. The men, who were in the majority, sat down at
 the first table in the vestibule; the ladies at the second in the dining
 room with the Marquis and Marchioness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a blending
 of the perfume of flowers and of the fine linen, of the fumes of the
 viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver dish covers reflected
 the lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal covered with
 light steam reflected from one to the other pale rays; bouquets were
 placed in a row the whole length of the table; and in the large-bordered
 plates each napkin, arranged after the fashion of a bishop's mitre, held
 between its two gaping folds a small oval shaped roll. The red claws of
 lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open baskets was piled up on
 moss; there were quails in their plumage; smoke was rising; and in silk
 stockings, knee-breeches, white cravat, and frilled shirt, the steward,
 grave as a judge, offering ready carved dishes between the shoulders of
 the guests, with a touch of the spoon gave you the piece chosen. On the
 large stove of porcelain inlaid with copper baguettes the statue of a
 woman, draped to the chin, gazed motionless on the room full of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary noticed that many ladies had not put their gloves in their
 glasses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But at the upper end of the table, alone amongst all these women, bent
 over his full plate, and his napkin tied round his neck like a child, an
 old man sat eating, letting drops of gravy drip from his mouth. His eyes
 were bloodshot, and he wore a little queue tied with black ribbon. He was
 the Marquis's father-in-law, the old Duke de Laverdiere, once on a time
 favourite of the Count d'Artois, in the days of the Vaudreuil
 hunting-parties at the Marquis de Conflans', and had been, it was said,
 the lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and
 Monsieur de Lauzun. He had lived a life of noisy debauch, full of duels,
 bets, elopements; he had squandered his fortune and frightened all his
 family. A servant behind his chair named aloud to him in his ear the
 dishes that he pointed to stammering, and constantly Emma's eyes turned
 involuntarily to this old man with hanging lips, as to something
 extraordinary. He had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens! Iced
 champagne was poured out. Emma shivered all over as she felt it cold in
 her mouth. She had never seen pomegranates nor tasted pineapples. The
 powdered sugar even seemed to her whiter and finer than elsewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the ball.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma made her toilet with the fastidious care of an actress on her debut.
 She did her hair according to the directions of the hairdresser, and put
 on the barege dress spread out upon the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles's trousers were tight across the belly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dancing?" repeated Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you must be mad! They would make fun of you; keep your place.
 Besides, it is more becoming for a doctor," she added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles was silent. He walked up and down waiting for Emma to finish
 dressing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw her from behind in the glass between two lights. Her black eyes
 seemed blacker than ever. Her hair, undulating towards the ears, shone
 with a blue lustre; a rose in her chignon trembled on its mobile stalk,
 with artificial dewdrops on the tip of the leaves. She wore a gown of pale
 saffron trimmed with three bouquets of pompon roses mixed with green.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles came and kissed her on her shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let me alone!" she said; "you are tumbling me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a horn. She
 went downstairs restraining herself from running.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dancing had begun. Guests were arriving. There was some crushing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sat down on a form near the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The quadrille over, the floor was occupied by groups of men standing up
 and talking and servants in livery bearing large trays. Along the line of
 seated women painted fans were fluttering, bouquets half hid smiling
 faces, and gold stoppered scent-bottles were turned in partly-closed
 hands, whose white gloves outlined the nails and tightened on the flesh at
 the wrists. Lace trimmings, diamond brooches, medallion bracelets trembled
 on bodices, gleamed on breasts, clinked on bare arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hair, well-smoothed over the temples and knotted at the nape, bore
 crowns, or bunches, or sprays of mytosotis, jasmine, pomegranate blossoms,
 ears of corn, and corn-flowers. Calmly seated in their places, mothers
 with forbidding countenances were wearing red turbans.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma's heart beat rather faster when, her partner holding her by the tips
 of the fingers, she took her place in a line with the dancers, and waited
 for the first note to start. But her emotion soon vanished, and, swaying
 to the rhythm of the orchestra, she glided forward with slight movements
 of the neck. A smile rose to her lips at certain delicate phrases of the
 violin, that sometimes played alone while the other instruments were
 silent; one could hear the clear clink of the louis d'or that were being
 thrown down upon the card tables in the next room; then all struck again,
 the cornet-a-piston uttered its sonorous note, feet marked time, skirts
 swelled and rustled, hands touched and parted; the same eyes falling
 before you met yours again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few men (some fifteen or so), of twenty-five to forty, scattered here
 and there among the dancers or talking at the doorways, distinguished
 themselves from the crowd by a certain air of breeding, whatever their
 differences in age, dress, or face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their clothes, better made, seemed of finer cloth, and their hair, brought
 forward in curls towards the temples, glossy with more delicate pomades.
 They had the complexion of wealth?that clear complexion that is
 heightened by the pallor of porcelain, the shimmer of satin, the veneer of
 old furniture, and that an ordered regimen of exquisite nurture maintains
 at its best. Their necks moved easily in their low cravats, their long
 whiskers fell over their turned-down collars, they wiped their lips upon
 handkerchiefs with embroidered initials that gave forth a subtle perfume.
 Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of youth, while there was
 something mature in the faces of the young. In their unconcerned looks was
 the calm of passions daily satiated, and through all their gentleness of
 manner pierced that peculiar brutality, the result of a command of
 half-easy things, in which force is exercised and vanity amused?the
 management of thoroughbred horses and the society of loose women.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few steps from Emma a gentleman in a blue coat was talking of Italy with
 a pale young woman wearing a parure of pearls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were praising the breadth of the columns of St. Peter's, Tivoly,
 Vesuvius, Castellamare, and Cassines, the roses of Genoa, the Coliseum by
 moonlight. With her other ear Emma was listening to a conversation full of
 words she did not understand. A circle gathered round a very young man who
 the week before had beaten "Miss Arabella" and "Romolus," and won two
 thousand louis jumping a ditch in England. One complained that his
 racehorses were growing fat; another of the printers' errors that had
 disfigured the name of his horse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The atmosphere of the ball was heavy; the lamps were growing dim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Guests were flocking to the billiard room. A servant got upon a chair and
 broke the window-panes. At the crash of the glass Madame Bovary turned her
 head and saw in the garden the faces of peasants pressed against the
 window looking in at them. Then the memory of the Bertaux came back to
 her. She saw the farm again, the muddy pond, her father in a blouse under
 the apple trees, and she saw herself again as formerly, skimming with her
 finger the cream off the milk-pans in the dairy. But in the refulgence of
 the present hour her past life, so distinct until then, faded away
 completely, and she almost doubted having lived it. She was there; beyond
 the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest. She was just eating a
 maraschino ice that she held with her left hand in a silver-gilt cup, her
 eyes half-closed, and the spoon between her teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A lady near her dropped her fan. A gentlemen was passing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you be so good," said the lady, "as to pick up my fan that has
 fallen behind the sofa?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The gentleman bowed, and as he moved to stretch out his arm, Emma saw the
 hand of a young woman throw something white, folded in a triangle, into
 his hat. The gentleman, picking up the fan, offered it to the lady
 respectfully; she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began
 smelling her bouquet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups a la
 bisque and au lait d'amandes*, puddings a la Trafalgar, and all sorts of
 cold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes, the carriages one
 after the other began to drive off. Raising the corners of the muslin
 curtain, one could see the light of their lanterns glimmering through the
 darkness. The seats began to empty, some card-players were still left; the
 musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their tongues. Charles
 was half asleep, his back propped against a door.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *With almond milk
</pre>
 <p>
 At three o'clock the cotillion began. Emma did not know how to waltz.
 Everyone was waltzing, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers herself and the
 Marquis; only the guests staying at the castle were still there, about a
 dozen persons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the waltzers, however, who was familiarly called Viscount, and
 whose low cut waistcoat seemed moulded to his chest, came a second time to
 ask Madame Bovary to dance, assuring her that he would guide her, and that
 she would get through it very well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They began slowly, then went more rapidly. They turned; all around them
 was turning?the lamps, the furniture, the wainscoting, the floor,
 like a disc on a pivot. On passing near the doors the bottom of Emma's
 dress caught against his trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their legs commingled; he looked down at her; she raised her eyes to his.
 A torpor seized her; she stopped. They started again, and with a more
 rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her along disappeared with her to
 the end of the gallery, where panting, she almost fell, and for a moment
 rested her head upon his breast. And then, still turning, but more slowly,
 he guided her back to her seat. She leaned back against the wall and
 covered her eyes with her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room three
 waltzers were kneeling before a lady sitting on a stool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everyone looked at them. They passed and re-passed, she with rigid body,
 her chin bent down, and he always in the same pose, his figure curved, his
 elbow rounded, his chin thrown forward. That woman knew how to waltz! They
 kept up a long time, and tired out all the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they talked a few moments longer, and after the goodnights, or rather
 good mornings, the guests of the chateau retired to bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles dragged himself up by the balusters. His "knees were going up into
 his body." He had spent five consecutive hours standing bolt upright at
 the card tables, watching them play whist, without understanding anything
 about it, and it was with a deep sigh of relief that he pulled off his
 boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma threw a shawl over her shoulders, opened the window, and leant out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. She breathed in the
 damp wind that refreshed her eyelids. The music of the ball was still
 murmuring in her ears. And she tried to keep herself awake in order to
 prolong the illusion of this luxurious life that she would soon have to
 give up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Day began to break. She looked long at the windows of the chateau, trying
 to guess which were the rooms of all those she had noticed the evening
 before. She would fain have known their lives, have penetrated, blended
 with them. But she was shivering with cold. She undressed, and cowered
 down between the sheets against Charles, who was asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were a great many people to luncheon. The repast lasted ten minutes;
 no liqueurs were served, which astonished the doctor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll in a
 small basket to take them to the swans on the ornamental waters, and they
 went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange plants, bristling with
 hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging vases, whence, as from over-filled
 nests of serpents, fell long green cords interlacing. The orangery, which
 was at the other end, led by a covered way to the outhouses of the
 chateau. The Marquis, to amuse the young woman, took her to see the
 stables.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Above the basket-shaped racks porcelain slabs bore the names of the horses
 in black letters. Each animal in its stall whisked its tail when anyone
 went near and said "Tchk! tchk!" The boards of the harness room shone like
 the flooring of a drawing room. The carriage harness was piled up in the
 middle against two twisted columns, and the bits, the whips, the spurs,
 the curbs, were ranged in a line all along the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his horse to. The dog-cart
 was brought to the foot of the steps, and, all the parcels being crammed
 in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the Marquis and Marchioness and set
 out again for Tostes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma watched the turning wheels in silence. Charles, on the extreme edge
 of the seat, held the reins with his two arms wide apart, and the little
 horse ambled along in the shafts that were too big for him. The loose
 reins hanging over his crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened on
 behind the chaise gave great regular bumps against it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were on the heights of Thibourville when suddenly some horsemen with
 cigars between their lips passed laughing. Emma thought she recognized the
 Viscount, turned back, and caught on the horizon only the movement of the
 heads rising or falling with the unequal cadence of the trot or gallop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A mile farther on they had to stop to mend with some string the traces
 that had broken.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Charles, giving a last look to the harness, saw something on the
 ground between his horse's legs, and he picked up a cigar-case with a
 green silk border and beblazoned in the centre like the door of a
 carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are even two cigars in it," said he; "they'll do for this evening
 after dinner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, do you smoke?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes, when I get a chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He put his find in his pocket and whipped up the nag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they reached home the dinner was not ready. Madame lost her temper.
 Nastasie answered rudely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave the room!" said Emma. "You are forgetting yourself. I give you
 warning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For dinner there was onion soup and a piece of veal with sorrel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How good it is to be at home again!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nastasie could be heard crying. He was rather fond of the poor girl. She
 had formerly, during the wearisome time of his widowhood, kept him company
 many an evening. She had been his first patient, his oldest acquaintance
 in the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you given her warning for good?" he asked at last.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Who is to prevent me?" she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they warmed themselves in the kitchen while their room was being made
 ready. Charles began to smoke. He smoked with lips protruding, spitting
 every moment, recoiling at every puff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll make yourself ill," she said scornfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the
 pump. Emma seizing hold of the cigar case threw it quickly to the back of
 the cupboard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day was a long one. She walked about her little garden, up and
 down the same walks, stopping before the beds, before the espalier, before
 the plaster curate, looking with amazement at all these things of
 once-on-a-time that she knew so well. How far off the ball seemed already!
 What was it that thus set so far asunder the morning of the day before
 yesterday and the evening of to-day? Her journey to Vaubyessard had made a
 hole in her life, like one of those great crevices that a storm will
 sometimes make in one night in mountains. Still she was resigned. She
 devoutly put away in her drawers her beautiful dress, down to the satin
 shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax of the dancing
 floor. Her heart was like these. In its friction against wealth something
 had come over it that could not be effaced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The memory of this ball, then, became an occupation for Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whenever the Wednesday came round she said to herself as she awoke, "Ah! I
 was there a week?a fortnight?three weeks ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And little by little the faces grew confused in her remembrance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the liveries and
 appointments so distinctly; some details escaped her, but the regret
 remained with her.

 <h2>
 Chapter Nine
 </h2>
 <p>
 Often when Charles was out she took from the cupboard, between the folds
 of the linen where she had left it, the green silk cigar case. She looked
 at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining?a mixture
 of verbena and tobacco. Whose was it? The Viscount's? Perhaps it was a
 present from his mistress. It had been embroidered on some rosewood frame,
 a pretty little thing, hidden from all eyes, that had occupied many hours,
 and over which had fallen the soft curls of the pensive worker. A breath
 of love had passed over the stitches on the canvas; each prick of the
 needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and all those interwoven
 threads of silk were but the continuity of the same silent passion. And
 then one morning the Viscount had taken it away with him. Of what had they
 spoken when it lay upon the wide-mantelled chimneys between flower-vases
 and Pompadour clocks? She was at Tostes; he was at Paris now, far away!
 What was this Paris like? What a vague name! She repeated it in a low
 voice, for the mere pleasure of it; it rang in her ears like a great
 cathedral bell; it shone before her eyes, even on the labels of her
 pomade-pots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At night, when the carriers passed under her windows in their carts
 singing the "Marjolaine," she awoke, and listened to the noise of the
 iron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country road, was soon
 deadened by the soil. "They will be there to-morrow!" she said to herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she followed them in thought up and down the hills, traversing
 villages, gliding along the highroads by the light of the stars. At the
 end of some indefinite distance there was always a confused spot, into
 which her dream died.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her finger on the map she
 walked about the capital. She went up the boulevards, stopping at every
 turning, between the lines of the streets, in front of the white squares
 that represented the houses. At last she would close the lids of her weary
 eyes, and see in the darkness the gas jets flaring in the wind and the
 steps of carriages lowered with much noise before the peristyles of
 theatres.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took in "La Corbeille," a lady's journal, and the "Sylphe des Salons."
 She devoured, without skipping a word, all the accounts of first nights,
 races, and soirees, took interest in the debut of a singer, in the opening
 of a new shop. She knew the latest fashions, the addresses of the best
 tailors, the days of the Bois and the Opera. In Eugene Sue she studied
 descriptions of furniture; she read Balzac and George Sand, seeking in
 them imaginary satisfaction for her own desires. Even at table she had her
 book by her, and turned over the pages while Charles ate and talked to
 her. The memory of the Viscount always returned as she read. Between him
 and the imaginary personages she made comparisons. But the circle of which
 he was the centre gradually widened round him, and the aureole that he
 bore, fading from his form, broadened out beyond, lighting up her other
 dreams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Paris, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma's eyes in an
 atmosphere of vermilion. The many lives that stirred amid this tumult
 were, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. Emma
 perceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in
 themselves represented all humanity. The world of ambassadors moved over
 polished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables
 covered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with
 trains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the
 society of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o'clock; the
 women, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,
 unappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to
 death at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards
 the forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants, where
 one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the motley
 crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as kings, full
 of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an existence outside that
 of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of storms, having
 something of the sublime. For the rest of the world it was lost, with no
 particular place and as if non-existent. The nearer things were, moreover,
 the more her thoughts turned away from them. All her immediate
 surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class imbeciles, the
 mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a peculiar chance that
 had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as far as eye could see,
 an immense land of joys and passions. She confused in her desire the
 sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart, elegance of manners
 with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like Indian plants, need a
 special soil, a particular temperature? Signs by moonlight, long embraces,
 tears flowing over yielded hands, all the fevers of the flesh and the
 languors of tenderness could not be separated from the balconies of great
 castles full of indolence, from boudoirs with silken curtains and thick
 carpets, well-filled flower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the
 flashing of precious stones and the shoulder-knots of liveries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every morning
 passed through the passage with his heavy wooden shoes; there were holes
 in his blouse; his feet were bare in list slippers. And this was the groom
 in knee-britches with whom she had to be content! His work done, he did
 not come back again all day, for Charles on his return put up his horse
 himself, unsaddled him and put on the halter, while the servant-girl
 brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could into the manger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears) Emma took
 into her service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan with a sweet face.
 She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught her to address her in the
 third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before coming
 into a room, to iron, starch, and to dress her?wanted to make a
 lady's-maid of her. The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as not to
 be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard,
 Felicite every evening took a small supply of sugar that she ate alone in
 her bed after she had said her prayers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes in the afternoon she went to chat with the postilions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing gown that
 showed between the shawl facings of her bodice a pleated chamisette with
 three gold buttons. Her belt was a corded girdle with great tassels, and
 her small garnet coloured slippers had a large knot of ribbon that fell
 over her instep. She had bought herself a blotting book, writing case,
 pen-holder, and envelopes, although she had no one to write to; she dusted
 her what-not, looked at herself in the glass, picked up a book, and then,
 dreaming between the lines, let it drop on her knees. She longed to travel
 or to go back to her convent. She wished at the same time to die and to
 live in Paris.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles in snow and rain trotted across country. He ate omelettes on
 farmhouse tables, poked his arm into damp beds, received the tepid spurt
 of blood-lettings in his face, listened to death-rattles, examined basins,
 turned over a good deal of dirty linen; but every evening he found a
 blazing fire, his dinner ready, easy-chairs, and a well-dressed woman,
 charming with an odour of freshness, though no one could say whence the
 perfume came, or if it were not her skin that made odorous her chemise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She charmed him by numerous attentions; now it was some new way of
 arranging paper sconces for the candles, a flounce that she altered on her
 gown, or an extraordinary name for some very simple dish that the servant
 had spoilt, but that Charles swallowed with pleasure to the last mouthful.
 At Rouen she saw some ladies who wore a bunch of charms on the
 watch-chains; she bought some charms. She wanted for her mantelpiece two
 large blue glass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a
 silver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these refinements the
 more they seduced him. They added something to the pleasure of the senses
 and to the comfort of his fireside. It was like a golden dust sanding all
 along the narrow path of his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was well, looked well; his reputation was firmly established.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The country-folk loved him because he was not proud. He petted the
 children, never went to the public house, and, moreover, his morals
 inspired confidence. He was specially successful with catarrhs and chest
 complaints. Being much afraid of killing his patients, Charles, in fact
 only prescribed sedatives, from time to time and emetic, a footbath, or
 leeches. It was not that he was afraid of surgery; he bled people
 copiously like horses, and for the taking out of teeth he had the "devil's
 own wrist."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, to keep up with the times, he took in "La Ruche Medicale," a new
 journal whose prospectus had been sent him. He read it a little after
 dinner, but in about five minutes the warmth of the room added to the
 effect of his dinner sent him to sleep; and he sat there, his chin on his
 two hands and his hair spreading like a mane to the foot of the lamp. Emma
 looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. Why, at least, was not her
 husband one of those men of taciturn passions who work at their books all
 night, and at last, when about sixty, the age of rheumatism sets in, wear
 a string of orders on their ill-fitting black coat? She could have wished
 this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been illustrious, to see it
 displayed at the booksellers', repeated in the newspapers, known to all
 France. But Charles had no ambition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An Yvetot doctor whom he had lately met in consultation had somewhat
 humiliated him at the very bedside of the patient, before the assembled
 relatives. When, in the evening, Charles told her this anecdote, Emma
 inveighed loudly against his colleague. Charles was much touched. He
 kissed her forehead with a tear in his eyes. But she was angered with
 shame; she felt a wild desire to strike him; she went to open the window
 in the passage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a man! What a man!" she said in a low voice, biting her lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides, she was becoming more irritated with him. As he grew older his
 manner grew heavier; at dessert he cut the corks of the empty bottles;
 after eating he cleaned his teeth with his tongue; in taking soup he made
 a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and, as he was getting fatter, the
 puffed-out cheeks seemed to push the eyes, always small, up to the
 temples.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his
 waistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he was
 going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it was for
 herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation. Sometimes, too,
 she told him of what she had read, such as a passage in a novel, of a new
 play, or an anecdote of the "upper ten" that she had seen in a feuilleton;
 for, after all, Charles was something, an ever-open ear, and ever-ready
 approbation. She confided many a thing to her greyhound. She would have
 done so to the logs in the fireplace or to the pendulum of the clock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to
 happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the
 solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the
 horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring
 it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or
 a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the portholes. But
 each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened
 to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come;
 then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for the morrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Spring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear trees began
 to blossom, she suffered from dyspnoea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the beginning of July she counted how many weeks there were to
 October, thinking that perhaps the Marquis d'Andervilliers would give
 another ball at Vaubyessard. But all September passed without letters or
 visits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained empty,
 and then the same series of days recommenced. So now they would thus
 follow one another, always the same, immovable, and bringing nothing.
 Other lives, however flat, had at least the chance of some event. One
 adventure sometimes brought with it infinite consequences and the scene
 changed. But nothing happened to her; God had willed it so! The future was
 a dark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gave up music. What was the good of playing? Who would hear her? Since
 she could never, in a velvet gown with short sleeves, striking with her
 light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a concert, feel the murmur of
 ecstasy envelop her like a breeze, it was not worth while boring herself
 with practicing. Her drawing cardboard and her embroidery she left in the
 cupboard. What was the good? What was the good? Sewing irritated her. "I
 have read everything," she said to herself. And she sat there making the
 tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How sad she was on Sundays when vespers sounded! She listened with dull
 attention to each stroke of the cracked bell. A cat slowly walking over
 some roof put up his back in the pale rays of the sun. The wind on the
 highroad blew up clouds of dust. Afar off a dog sometimes howled; and the
 bell, keeping time, continued its monotonous ringing that died away over
 the fields.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the people came out from church. The women in waxed clogs, the
 peasants in new blouses, the little bare-headed children skipping along in
 front of them, all were going home. And till nightfall, five or six men,
 always the same, stayed playing at corks in front of the large door of the
 inn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The winter was severe. The windows every morning were covered with rime,
 and the light shining through them, dim as through ground-glass, sometimes
 did not change the whole day long. At four o'clock the lamp had to be
 lighted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On fine days she went down into the garden. The dew had left on the
 cabbages a silver lace with long transparent threads spreading from one to
 the other. No birds were to be heard; everything seemed asleep, the
 espalier covered with straw, and the vine, like a great sick serpent under
 the coping of the wall, along which, on drawing hear, one saw the
 many-footed woodlice crawling. Under the spruce by the hedgerow, the curie
 in the three-cornered hat reading his breviary had lost his right foot,
 and the very plaster, scaling off with the frost, had left white scabs on
 his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting with the
 heat of the hearth, felt her boredom weigh more heavily than ever. She
 would have liked to go down and talk to the servant, but a sense of shame
 restrained her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened the
 shutters of his house, and the rural policeman, wearing his sabre over his
 blouse, passed by. Night and morning the post-horses, three by three,
 crossed the street to water at the pond. From time to time the bell of a
 public house door rang, and when it was windy one could hear the little
 brass basins that served as signs for the hairdresser's shop creaking on
 their two rods. This shop had as decoration an old engraving of a
 fashion-plate stuck against a windowpane and the wax bust of a woman with
 yellow hair. He, too, the hairdresser, lamented his wasted calling, his
 hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in a big town?at Rouen,
 for example, overlooking the harbour, near the theatre?he walked up
 and down all day from the mairie to the church, sombre and waiting for
 customers. When Madame Bovary looked up, she always saw him there, like a
 sentinel on duty, with his skullcap over his ears and his vest of lasting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the head of a
 man appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers, smiling slowly, with a
 broad, gentle smile that showed his white teeth. A waltz immediately began
 and on the organ, in a little drawing room, dancers the size of a finger,
 women in pink turbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock coats,
 gentlemen in knee-breeches, turned and turned between the sofas, the
 consoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together at their
 corners by a piece of gold paper. The man turned his handle, looking to
 the right and left, and up at the windows. Now and again, while he shot
 out a long squirt of brown saliva against the milestone, with his knee
 raised his instrument, whose hard straps tired his shoulder; and now,
 doleful and drawling, or gay and hurried, the music escaped from the box,
 droning through a curtain of pink taffeta under a brass claw in arabesque.
 They were airs played in other places at the theatres, sung in drawing
 rooms, danced to at night under lighted lustres, echoes of the world that
 reached even to Emma. Endless sarabands ran through her head, and, like an
 Indian dancing girl on the flowers of a carpet, her thoughts leapt with
 the notes, swung from dream to dream, from sadness to sadness. When the
 man had caught some coppers in his cap, he drew down an old cover of blue
 cloth, hitched his organ on to his back, and went off with a heavy tread.
 She watched him going.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her, in this
 small room on the ground floor, with its smoking stove, its creaking door,
 the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all the bitterness in life seemed
 served up on her plate, and with smoke of the boiled beef there rose from
 her secret soul whiffs of sickliness. Charles was a slow eater; she played
 with a few nuts, or, leaning on her elbow, amused herself with drawing
 lines along the oilcloth table cover with the point of her knife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She now let everything in her household take care of itself, and Madame
 Bovary senior, when she came to spend part of Lent at Tostes, was much
 surprised at the change. She who was formerly so careful, so dainty, now
 passed whole days without dressing, wore grey cotton stockings, and burnt
 tallow candles. She kept saying they must be economical since they were
 not rich, adding that she was very contented, very happy, that Tostes
 pleased her very much, with other speeches that closed the mouth of her
 mother-in-law. Besides, Emma no longer seemed inclined to follow her
 advice; once even, Madame Bovary having thought fit to maintain that
 mistresses ought to keep an eye on the religion of their servants, she had
 answered with so angry a look and so cold a smile that the good woman did
 not interfere again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was growing difficult, capricious. She ordered dishes for herself,
 then she did not touch them; one day drank only pure milk, the next cups
 of tea by the dozen. Often she persisted in not going out, then, stifling,
 threw open the windows and put on light dresses. After she had well
 scolded her servant she gave her presents or sent her out to see
 neighbours, just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her
 purse, although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to
 the feelings of others, like most country-bred people, who always retain
 in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his cure, himself
 brought his son-in-law a superb turkey, and stayed three days at Tostes.
 Charles being with his patients, Emma kept him company. He smoked in the
 room, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and
 municipal council, so that when he left she closed the door on him with a
 feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself. Moreover she no
 longer concealed her contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she
 set herself to express singular opinions, finding fault with that which
 others approved, and approving things perverse and immoral, all of which
 made her husband open his eyes widely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Would this misery last for ever? Would she never issue from it? Yet she
 was as good as all the women who were living happily. She had seen
 duchesses at Vaubyessard with clumsier waists and commoner ways, and she
 execrated the injustice of God. She leant her head against the walls to
 weep; she envied lives of stir; longed for masked balls, for violent
 pleasures, with all the wildness that she did not know, but that these
 must surely yield.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She grew pale and suffered from palpitations of the heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles prescribed valerian and camphor baths. Everything that was tried
 only seemed to irritate her the more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On certain days she chatted with feverish rapidity, and this
 over-excitement was suddenly followed by a state of torpor, in which she
 remained without speaking, without moving. What then revived her was
 pouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her
 illness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing on this idea,
 began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From that moment she drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little cough, and
 completely lost her appetite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It cost Charles much to give up Tostes after living there four years and
 "when he was beginning to get on there." Yet if it must be! He took her to
 Rouen to see his old master. It was a nervous complaint: change of air was
 needed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After looking about him on this side and on that, Charles learnt that in
 the Neufchatel arrondissement there was a considerable market town called
 Yonville-l'Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish refugee, had decamped a week
 before. Then he wrote to the chemist of the place to ask the number of the
 population, the distance from the nearest doctor, what his predecessor had
 made a year, and so forth; and the answer being satisfactory, he made up
 his mind to move towards the spring, if Emma's health did not improve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer,
 something pricked her finger. It was a wire of her wedding bouquet. The
 orange blossoms were yellow with dust and the silver bordered satin
 ribbons frayed at the edges. She threw it into the fire. It flared up more
 quickly than dry straw. Then it was, like a red bush in the cinders,
 slowly devoured. She watched it burn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold lace
 melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black
 butterflies at the back of the stove, at least flew up the chimney.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was pregnant.

 <h2>
 Chapter One
 </h2>
 <p>
 Yonville-l'Abbaye (so called from an old Capuchin abbey of which not even
 the ruins remain) is a market-town twenty-four miles from Rouen, between
 the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, at the foot of a valley watered by the
 Rieule, a little river that runs into the Andelle after turning three
 water-mills near its mouth, where there are a few trout that the lads
 amuse themselves by fishing for on Sundays.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We leave the highroad at La Boissiere and keep straight on to the top of
 the Leux hill, whence the valley is seen. The river that runs through it
 makes of it, as it were, two regions with distinct physiognomies?all
 on the left is pasture land, all of the right arable. The meadow stretches
 under a bulge of low hills to join at the back with the pasture land of
 the Bray country, while on the eastern side, the plain, gently rising,
 broadens out, showing as far as eye can follow its blond cornfields. The
 water, flowing by the grass, divides with a white line the colour of the
 roads and of the plains, and the country is like a great unfolded mantle
 with a green velvet cape bordered with a fringe of silver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the forest of
 Argueil, with the steeps of the Saint-Jean hills scarred from top to
 bottom with red irregular lines; they are rain tracks, and these
 brick-tones standing out in narrow streaks against the grey colour of the
 mountain are due to the quantity of iron springs that flow beyond in the
 neighboring country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France, a
 bastard land whose language is without accent and its landscape is without
 character. It is there that they make the worst Neufchatel cheeses of all
 the arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming is costly because so
 much manure is needed to enrich this friable soil full of sand and flints.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Up to 1835 there was no practicable road for getting to Yonville, but
 about this time a cross-road was made which joins that of Abbeville to
 that of Amiens, and is occasionally used by the Rouen wagoners on their
 way to Flanders. Yonville-l'Abbaye has remained stationary in spite of its
 "new outlet." Instead of improving the soil, they persist in keeping up
 the pasture lands, however depreciated they may be in value, and the lazy
 borough, growing away from the plain, has naturally spread riverwards. It
 is seem from afar sprawling along the banks like a cowherd taking a siesta
 by the water-side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins a roadway, planted with
 young aspens, that leads in a straight line to the first houses in the
 place. These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle of courtyards full of
 straggling buildings, wine-presses, cart-sheds and distilleries scattered
 under thick trees, with ladders, poles, or scythes hung on to the
 branches. The thatched roofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach down
 over about a third of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses have
 knots in the middle like the bottoms of bottles. Against the plaster wall
 diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree sometimes leans and
 the ground-floors have at their door a small swing-gate to keep out the
 chicks that come pilfering crumbs of bread steeped in cider on the
 threshold. But the courtyards grow narrower, the houses closer together,
 and the fences disappear; a bundle of ferns swings under a window from the
 end of a broomstick; there is a blacksmith's forge and then a
 wheelwright's, with two or three new carts outside that partly block the
 way. Then across an open space appears a white house beyond a grass mound
 ornamented by a Cupid, his finger on his lips; two brass vases are at each
 end of a flight of steps; scutcheons* blaze upon the door. It is the
 notary's house, and the finest in the place.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *The panonceaux that have to be hung over the doors of
 notaries.
</pre>
 <p>
 The Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther down,
 at the entrance of the square. The little cemetery that surrounds it,
 closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of graves that the old stones,
 level with the ground, form a continuous pavement, on which the grass of
 itself has marked out regular green squares. The church was rebuilt during
 the last years of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof is beginning to
 rot from the top, and here and there has black hollows in its blue colour.
 Over the door, where the organ should be, is a loft for the men, with a
 spiral staircase that reverberates under their wooden shoes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls obliquely upon
 the pews ranged along the walls, which are adorned here and there with a
 straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters, "Mr. So-and-so's
 pew." Farther on, at a spot where the building narrows, the confessional
 forms a pendant to a statuette of the Virgin, clothed in a satin robe,
 coifed with a tulle veil sprinkled with silver stars, and with red cheeks,
 like an idol of the Sandwich Islands; and, finally, a copy of the "Holy
 Family, presented by the Minister of the Interior," overlooking the high
 altar, between four candlesticks, closes in the perspective. The choir
 stalls, of deal wood, have been left unpainted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts,
 occupies of itself about half the public square of Yonville. The town
 hall, constructed "from the designs of a Paris architect," is a sort of
 Greek temple that forms the corner next to the chemist's shop. On the
 ground-floor are three Ionic columns and on the first floor a semicircular
 gallery, while the dome that crowns it is occupied by a Gallic cock,
 resting one foot upon the "Charte" and holding in the other the scales of
 Justice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But that which most attracts the eye is opposite the Lion d'Or inn, the
 chemist's shop of Monsieur Homais. In the evening especially its argand
 lamp is lit up and the red and green jars that embellish his shop-front
 throw far across the street their two streams of colour; then across them
 as if in Bengal lights is seen the shadow of the chemist leaning over his
 desk. His house from top to bottom is placarded with inscriptions written
 in large hand, round hand, printed hand: "Vichy, Seltzer, Barege waters,
 blood purifiers, Raspail patent medicine, Arabian racahout, Darcet
 lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths, hygienic chocolate," etc. And
 the signboard, which takes up all the breadth of the shop, bears in gold
 letters, "Homais, Chemist." Then at the back of the shop, behind the great
 scales fixed to the counter, the word "Laboratory" appears on a scroll
 above a glass door, which about half-way up once more repeats "Homais" in
 gold letters on a black ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Beyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. The street (the only one)
 a gunshot in length and flanked by a few shops on either side stops short
 at the turn of the highroad. If it is left on the right hand and the foot
 of the Saint-Jean hills followed the cemetery is soon reached.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of wall was
 pulled down, and three acres of land by its side purchased; but all the
 new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as heretofore, continue to
 crowd together towards the gate. The keeper, who is at once gravedigger
 and church beadle (thus making a double profit out of the parish corpses),
 has taken advantage of the unused plot of ground to plant potatoes there.
 From year to year, however, his small field grows smaller, and when there
 is an epidemic, he does not know whether to rejoice at the deaths or
 regret the burials.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!" the curie at last said to him one
 day. This grim remark made him reflect; it checked him for some time; but
 to this day he carries on the cultivation of his little tubers, and even
 maintains stoutly that they grow naturally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since the events about to be narrated, nothing in fact has changed at
 Yonville. The tin tricolour flag still swings at the top of the
 church-steeple; the two chintz streamers still flutter in the wind from
 the linen-draper's; the chemist's fetuses, like lumps of white amadou, rot
 more and more in their turbid alcohol, and above the big door of the inn
 the old golden lion, faded by rain, still shows passers-by its poodle
 mane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow
 Lefrancois, the landlady of this inn, was so very busy that she sweated
 great drops as she moved her saucepans. To-morrow was market-day. The meat
 had to be cut beforehand, the fowls drawn, the soup and coffee made.
 Moreover, she had the boarders' meal to see to, and that of the doctor,
 his wife, and their servant; the billiard-room was echoing with bursts of
 laughter; three millers in a small parlour were calling for brandy; the
 wood was blazing, the brazen pan was hissing, and on the long kitchen
 table, amid the quarters of raw mutton, rose piles of plates that rattled
 with the shaking of the block on which spinach was being chopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the poultry-yard was heard the screaming of the fowls whom the
 servant was chasing in order to wring their necks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man slightly marked with small-pox, in green leather slippers, and
 wearing a velvet cap with a gold tassel, was warming his back at the
 chimney. His face expressed nothing but self-satisfaction, and he appeared
 to take life as calmly as the goldfinch suspended over his head in its
 wicker cage: this was the chemist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Artemise!" shouted the landlady, "chop some wood, fill the water bottles,
 bring some brandy, look sharp! If only I knew what dessert to offer the
 guests you are expecting! Good heavens! Those furniture-movers are
 beginning their racket in the billiard-room again; and their van has been
 left before the front door! The 'Hirondelle' might run into it when it
 draws up. Call Polyte and tell him to put it up. Only think, Monsieur
 Homais, that since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk
 eight jars of cider! Why, they'll tear my cloth for me," she went on,
 looking at them from a distance, her strainer in her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That wouldn't be much of a loss," replied Monsieur Homais. "You would buy
 another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Another billiard-table!" exclaimed the widow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame Lefrancois. I tell you again
 you are doing yourself harm, much harm! And besides, players now want
 narrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards aren't played now; everything is
 changed! One must keep pace with the times! Just look at Tellier!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may say what you like; his table is better than yours; and if one
 were to think, for example, of getting up a patriotic pool for Poland or
 the sufferers from the Lyons floods?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't beggars like him that'll frighten us," interrupted the landlady,
 shrugging her fat shoulders. "Come, come, Monsieur Homais; as long as the
 'Lion d'Or' exists people will come to it. We've feathered our nest; while
 one of these days you'll find the 'Cafe Francais' closed with a big
 placard on the shutters. Change my billiard-table!" she went on, speaking
 to herself, "the table that comes in so handy for folding the washing, and
 on which, in the hunting season, I have slept six visitors! But that
 dawdler, Hivert, doesn't come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait for him! And what about Monsieur Binet? As the clock strikes six
 you'll see him come in, for he hasn't his equal under the sun for
 punctuality. He must always have his seat in the small parlour. He'd
 rather die than dine anywhere else. And so squeamish as he is, and so
 particular about the cider! Not like Monsieur Leon; he sometimes comes at
 seven, or even half-past, and he doesn't so much as look at what he eats.
 Such a nice young man! Never speaks a rough word!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see, there's a great difference between an educated man and an
 old carabineer who is now a tax-collector."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Six o'clock struck. Binet came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin body,
 and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of his head
 with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead, flattened by
 the constant wearing of a helmet. He wore a black cloth waistcoat, a hair
 collar, grey trousers, and, all the year round, well-blacked boots, that
 had two parallel swellings due to the sticking out of his big-toes. Not a
 hair stood out from the regular line of fair whiskers, which, encircling
 his jaws, framed, after the fashion of a garden border, his long, wan
 face, whose eyes were small and the nose hooked. Clever at all games of
 cards, a good hunter, and writing a fine hand, he had at home a lathe, and
 amused himself by turning napkin rings, with which he filled up his house,
 with the jealousy of an artist and the egotism of a bourgeois.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out
 first, and during the whole time necessary for laying the cloth, Binet
 remained silent in his place near the stove. Then he shut the door and
 took off his cap in his usual way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't with saying civil things that he'll wear out his tongue," said
 the chemist, as soon as he was along with the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He never talks more," she replied. "Last week two travelers in the cloth
 line were here?such clever chaps who told such jokes in the evening,
 that I fairly cried with laughing; and he stood there like a dab fish and
 never said a word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," observed the chemist; "no imagination, no sallies, nothing that
 makes the society-man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet they say he has parts," objected the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Parts!" replied Monsieur Homais; "he, parts! In his own line it is
 possible," he added in a calmer tone. And he went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! That a merchant, who has large connections, a jurisconsult, a doctor,
 a chemist, should be thus absent-minded, that they should become whimsical
 or even peevish, I can understand; such cases are cited in history. But at
 least it is because they are thinking of something. Myself, for example,
 how often has it happened to me to look on the bureau for my pen to write
 a label, and to find, after all, that I had put it behind my ear!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Lefrancois just then went to the door to see if the "Hirondelle"
 were not coming. She started. A man dressed in black suddenly came into
 the kitchen. By the last gleam of the twilight one could see that his face
 was rubicund and his form athletic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What can I do for you, Monsieur le Curie?" asked the landlady, as she
 reached down from the chimney one of the copper candlesticks placed with
 their candles in a row. "Will you take something? A thimbleful of Cassis*?
 A glass of wine?"
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Black currant liqueur.
</pre>
 <p>
 The priest declined very politely. He had come for his umbrella, that he
 had forgotten the other day at the Ernemont convent, and after asking
 Madame Lefrancois to have it sent to him at the presbytery in the evening,
 he left for the church, from which the Angelus was ringing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the chemist no longer heard the noise of his boots along the square,
 he thought the priest's behaviour just now very unbecoming. This refusal
 to take any refreshment seemed to him the most odious hypocrisy; all
 priests tippled on the sly, and were trying to bring back the days of the
 tithe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady took up the defence of her curie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee. Last year he
 helped our people to bring in the straw; he carried as many as six trusses
 at once, he is so strong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bravo!" said the chemist. "Now just send your daughters to confess to
 fellows which such a temperament! I, if I were the Government, I'd have
 the priests bled once a month. Yes, Madame Lefrancois, every month?a
 good phlebotomy, in the interests of the police and morals."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be quiet, Monsieur Homais. You are an infidel; you've no religion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The chemist answered: "I have a religion, my religion, and I even have
 more than all these others with their mummeries and their juggling. I
 adore God, on the contrary. I believe in the Supreme Being, in a Creator,
 whatever he may be. I care little who has placed us here below to fulfil
 our duties as citizens and fathers of families; but I don't need to go to
 church to kiss silver plates, and fatten, out of my pocket, a lot of
 good-for-nothings who live better than we do. For one can know Him as well
 in a wood, in a field, or even contemplating the eternal vault like the
 ancients. My God! Mine is the God of Socrates, of Franklin, of Voltaire,
 and of Beranger! I am for the profession of faith of the 'Savoyard Vicar,'
 and the immortal principles of '89! And I can't admit of an old boy of a
 God who takes walks in his garden with a cane in his hand, who lodges his
 friends in the belly of whales, dies uttering a cry, and rises again at
 the end of three days; things absurd in themselves, and completely
 opposed, moreover, to all physical laws, which prove to us, by the way,
 that priests have always wallowed in turpid ignorance, in which they would
 fain engulf the people with them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his bubbling over the
 chemist had for a moment fancied himself in the midst of the town council.
 But the landlady no longer heeded him; she was listening to a distant
 rolling. One could distinguish the noise of a carriage mingled with the
 clattering of loose horseshoes that beat against the ground, and at last
 the "Hirondelle" stopped at the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a yellow box on two large wheels, that, reaching to the tilt,
 prevented travelers from seeing the road and dirtied their shoulders. The
 small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their sashes when the coach
 was closed, and retained here and there patches of mud amid the old layers
 of dust, that not even storms of rain had altogether washed away. It was
 drawn by three horses, the first a leader, and when it came down-hill its
 bottom jolted against the ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some of the inhabitants of Yonville came out into the square; they all
 spoke at once, asking for news, for explanations, for hampers. Hivert did
 not know whom to answer. It was he who did the errands of the place in
 town. He went to the shops and brought back rolls of leather for the
 shoemaker, old iron for the farrier, a barrel of herrings for his
 mistress, caps from the milliner's, locks from the hair-dresser's and all
 along the road on his return journey he distributed his parcels, which he
 threw, standing upright on his seat and shouting at the top of his voice,
 over the enclosures of the yards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An accident had delayed him. Madame Bovary's greyhound had run across the
 field. They had whistled for him a quarter of an hour; Hivert had even
 gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to catch sight of her;
 but it had been necessary to go on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma had wept, grown angry; she had accused Charles of this misfortune.
 Monsieur Lheureux, a draper, who happened to be in the coach with her, had
 tried to console her by a number of examples of lost dogs recognizing
 their masters at the end of long years. One, he said had been told of, who
 had come back to Paris from Constantinople. Another had gone one hundred
 and fifty miles in a straight line, and swum four rivers; and his own
 father had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve years of absence, had
 all of a sudden jumped on his back in the street as he was going to dine
 in town.

 <h2>
 Chapter Two
 </h2>
 <p>
 Emma got out first, then Felicite, Monsieur Lheureux, and a nurse, and
 they had to wake up Charles in his corner, where he had slept soundly
 since night set in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais introduced himself; he offered his homages to madame and his
 respects to monsieur; said he was charmed to have been able to render them
 some slight service, and added with a cordial air that he had ventured to
 invite himself, his wife being away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Madame Bovary was in the kitchen she went up to the chimney.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee, and having
 thus pulled it up to her ankle, held out her foot in its black boot to the
 fire above the revolving leg of mutton. The flame lit up the whole of her,
 penetrating with a crude light the woof of her gowns, the fine pores of
 her fair skin, and even her eyelids, which she blinked now and again. A
 great red glow passed over her with the blowing of the wind through the
 half-open door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair watched her
 silently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he was a good deal bored at Yonville, where he was a clerk at the
 notary's, Monsieur Guillaumin, Monsieur Leon Dupuis (it was he who was the
 second habitue of the "Lion d'Or") frequently put back his dinner-hour in
 hope that some traveler might come to the inn, with whom he could chat in
 the evening. On the days when his work was done early, he had, for want of
 something else to do, to come punctually, and endure from soup to cheese a
 tete-a-tete with Binet. It was therefore with delight that he accepted the
 landlady's suggestion that he should dine in company with the newcomers,
 and they passed into the large parlour where Madame Lefrancois, for the
 purpose of showing off, had had the table laid for four.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap, for fear of coryza;
 then, turning to his neighbour?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame is no doubt a little fatigued; one gets jolted so abominably in
 our 'Hirondelle.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true," replied Emma; "but moving about always amuses me. I like
 change of place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is so tedious," sighed the clerk, "to be always riveted to the same
 places."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you were like me," said Charles, "constantly obliged to be in the
 saddle"?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," Leon went on, addressing himself to Madame Bovary, "nothing, it
 seems to me, is more pleasant?when one can," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Moreover," said the druggist, "the practice of medicine is not very hard
 work in our part of the world, for the state of our roads allows us the
 use of gigs, and generally, as the farmers are prosperous, they pay pretty
 well. We have, medically speaking, besides the ordinary cases of
 enteritis, bronchitis, bilious affections, etc., now and then a few
 intermittent fevers at harvest-time; but on the whole, little of a serious
 nature, nothing special to note, unless it be a great deal of scrofula,
 due, no doubt, to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasant
 dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur Bovary,
 much obstinacy of routine, with which all the efforts of your science will
 daily come into collision; for people still have recourse to novenas, to
 relics, to the priest, rather than come straight to the doctor or the
 chemist. The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad, and we even
 have a few nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I have made some
 observations) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade at the outside,
 which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or otherwise 54 degrees
 Fahrenheit (English scale), not more. And, as a matter of fact, we are
 sheltered from the north winds by the forest of Argueil on the one side,
 from the west winds by the St. Jean range on the other; and this heat,
 moreover, which, on account of the aqueous vapours given off by the river
 and the considerable number of cattle in the fields, which, as you know,
 exhale much ammonia, that is to say, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen (no,
 nitrogen and hydrogen alone), and which sucking up into itself the humus
 from the ground, mixing together all those different emanations, unites
 them into a stack, so to say, and combining with the electricity diffused
 through the atmosphere, when there is any, might in the long run, as in
 tropical countries, engender insalubrious miasmata?this heat, I say,
 finds itself perfectly tempered on the side whence it comes, or rather
 whence it should come?that is to say, the southern side?by the
 south-eastern winds, which, having cooled themselves passing over the
 Seine, reach us sometimes all at once like breezes from Russia."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?" continued Madame
 Bovary, speaking to the young man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very few," he answered. "There is a place they call La Pature, on the
 top of the hill, on the edge of the forest. Sometimes, on Sundays, I go
 and stay there with a book, watching the sunset."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think there is nothing so admirable as sunsets," she resumed; "but
 especially by the side of the sea."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I adore the sea!" said Monsieur Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And then, does it not seem to you," continued Madame Bovary, "that the
 mind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the contemplation of
 which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is the same with mountainous landscapes," continued Leon. "A cousin of
 mine who travelled in Switzerland last year told me that one could not
 picture to oneself the poetry of the lakes, the charm of the waterfalls,
 the gigantic effect of the glaciers. One sees pines of incredible size
 across torrents, cottages suspended over precipices, and, a thousand feet
 below one, whole valleys when the clouds open. Such spectacles must stir
 to enthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I no longer marvel at
 that celebrated musician who, the better to inspire his imagination, was
 in the habit of playing the piano before some imposing site."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You play?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, but I am very fond of music," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! don't you listen to him, Madame Bovary," interrupted Homais, bending
 over his plate. "That's sheer modesty. Why, my dear fellow, the other day
 in your room you were singing 'L'Ange Gardien' ravishingly. I heard you
 from the laboratory. You gave it like an actor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon, in fact, lodged at the chemist's where he had a small room on the
 second floor, overlooking the Place. He blushed at the compliment of his
 landlord, who had already turned to the doctor, and was enumerating to
 him, one after the other, all the principal inhabitants of Yonville. He
 was telling anecdotes, giving information; the fortune of the notary was
 not known exactly, and "there was the Tuvache household," who made a good
 deal of show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma continued, "And what music do you prefer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, German music; that which makes you dream."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you been to the opera?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not yet; but I shall go next year, when I am living at Paris to finish
 reading for the bar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As I had the honour of putting it to your husband," said the chemist,
 "with regard to this poor Yanoda who has run away, you will find yourself,
 thanks to his extravagance, in the possession of one of the most
 comfortable houses of Yonville. Its greatest convenience for a doctor is a
 door giving on the Walk, where one can go in and out unseen. Moreover, it
 contains everything that is agreeable in a household?a laundry,
 kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He was a gay
 dog, who didn't care what he spent. At the end of the garden, by the side
 of the water, he had an arbour built just for the purpose of drinking beer
 in summer; and if madame is fond of gardening she will be able?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My wife doesn't care about it," said Charles; "although she has been
 advised to take exercise, she prefers always sitting in her room reading."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like me," replied Leon. "And indeed, what is better than to sit by one's
 fireside in the evening with a book, while the wind beats against the
 window and the lamp is burning?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, indeed?" she said, fixing her large black eyes wide open upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One thinks of nothing," he continued; "the hours slip by. Motionless we
 traverse countries we fancy we see, and your thought, blending with the
 fiction, playing with the details, follows the outline of the adventures.
 It mingles with the characters, and it seems as if it were yourself
 palpitating beneath their costumes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true! That is true?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has it ever happened to you," Leon went on, "to come across some vague
 idea of one's own in a book, some dim image that comes back to you from
 afar, and as the completest expression of your own slightest sentiment?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have experienced it," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is why," he said, "I especially love the poets. I think verse more
 tender than prose, and that it moves far more easily to tears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Still in the long run it is tiring," continued Emma. "Now I, on the
 contrary, adore stories that rush breathlessly along, that frighten one. I
 detest commonplace heroes and moderate sentiments, such as there are in
 nature."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fact," observed the clerk, "these works, not touching the heart, miss,
 it seems to me, the true end of art. It is so sweet, amid all the
 disenchantments of life, to be able to dwell in thought upon noble
 characters, pure affections, and pictures of happiness. For myself, living
 here far from the world, this is my one distraction; but Yonville affords
 so few resources."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like Tostes, no doubt," replied Emma; "and so I always subscribed to a
 lending library."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If madame will do me the honour of making use of it", said the chemist,
 who had just caught the last words, "I have at her disposal a library
 composed of the best authors, Voltaire, Rousseau, Delille, Walter Scott,
 the 'Echo des Feuilletons'; and in addition I receive various periodicals,
 among them the 'Fanal de Rouen' daily, having the advantage to be its
 correspondent for the districts of Buchy, Forges, Neufchatel, Yonville,
 and vicinity."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For two hours and a half they had been at table; for the servant Artemis,
 carelessly dragging her old list slippers over the flags, brought one
 plate after the other, forgot everything, and constantly left the door of
 the billiard-room half open, so that it beat against the wall with its
 hooks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Unconsciously, Leon, while talking, had placed his foot on one of the bars
 of the chair on which Madame Bovary was sitting. She wore a small blue
 silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a gauffered cambric collar, and
 with the movements of her head the lower part of her face gently sunk into
 the linen or came out from it. Thus side by side, while Charles and the
 chemist chatted, they entered into one of those vague conversations where
 the hazard of all that is said brings you back to the fixed centre of a
 common sympathy. The Paris theatres, titles of novels, new quadrilles, and
 the world they did not know; Tostes, where she had lived, and Yonville,
 where they were; they examined all, talked of everything till to the end
 of dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room in the new
 house, and the guests soon raised the siege. Madame Lefrancois was asleep
 near the cinders, while the stable-boy, lantern in hand, was waiting to
 show Monsieur and Madame Bovary the way home. Bits of straw stuck in his
 red hair, and he limped with his left leg. When he had taken in his other
 hand the cure's umbrella, they started.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The town was asleep; the pillars of the market threw great shadows; the
 earth was all grey as on a summer's night. But as the doctor's house was
 only some fifty paces from the inn, they had to say good-night almost
 immediately, and the company dispersed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as she entered the passage, Emma felt the cold of the plaster fall
 about her shoulders like damp linen. The walls were new and the wooden
 stairs creaked. In their bedroom, on the first floor, a whitish light
 passed through the curtainless windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields,
 half-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in the moonlight along the course
 of the river. In the middle of the room, pell-mell, were scattered
 drawers, bottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with mattresses on the chairs
 and basins on the ground?the two men who had brought the furniture
 had left everything about carelessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was the fourth time that she had slept in a strange place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first was the day of her going to the convent; the second, of her
 arrival at Tostes; the third, at Vaubyessard; and this was the fourth. And
 each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration of a new phase in her
 life. She did not believe that things could present themselves in the same
 way in different places, and since the portion of her life lived had been
 bad, no doubt that which remained to be lived would be better.

 Chapter Three
 </h2>
 <p>
 The next day, as she was getting up, she saw the clerk on the Place. She
 had on a dressing-gown. He looked up and bowed. She nodded quickly and
 reclosed the window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon waited all day for six o'clock in the evening to come, but on going
 to the inn, he found no one but Monsieur Binet, already at table. The
 dinner of the evening before had been a considerable event for him; he had
 never till then talked for two hours consecutively to a "lady." How then
 had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things
 that he could not have said so well before? He was usually shy, and
 maintained that reserve which partakes at once of modesty and
 dissimulation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At Yonville he was considered "well-bred." He listened to the arguments of
 the older people, and did not seem hot about politics?a remarkable
 thing for a young man. Then he had some accomplishments; he painted in
 water-colours, could read the key of G, and readily talked literature
 after dinner when he did not play cards. Monsieur Homais respected him for
 his education; Madame Homais liked him for his good-nature, for he often
 took the little Homais into the garden?little brats who were always
 dirty, very much spoilt, and somewhat lymphatic, like their mother.
 Besides the servant to look after them, they had Justin, the chemist's
 apprentice, a second cousin of Monsieur Homais, who had been taken into
 the house from charity, and who was useful at the same time as a servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The druggist proved the best of neighbours. He gave Madame Bovary
 information as to the trades-people, sent expressly for his own cider
 merchant, tasted the drink himself, and saw that the casks were properly
 placed in the cellar; he explained how to set about getting in a supply of
 butter cheap, and made an arrangement with Lestiboudois, the sacristan,
 who, besides his sacerdotal and funeral functions, looked after the
 principal gardens at Yonville by the hour or the year, according to the
 taste of the customers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The need of looking after others was not the only thing that urged the
 chemist to such obsequious cordiality; there was a plan underneath it all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had infringed the law of the 19th Ventose, year xi., article I, which
 forbade all persons not having a diploma to practise medicine; so that,
 after certain anonymous denunciations, Homais had been summoned to Rouen
 to see the procurer of the king in his own private room; the magistrate
 receiving him standing up, ermine on shoulder and cap on head. It was in
 the morning, before the court opened. In the corridors one heard the heavy
 boots of the gendarmes walking past, and like a far-off noise great locks
 that were shut. The druggist's ears tingled as if he were about to have an
 apoplectic stroke; he saw the depths of dungeons, his family in tears, his
 shop sold, all the jars dispersed; and he was obliged to enter a cafe and
 take a glass of rum and seltzer to recover his spirits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Little by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and he
 continued, as heretofore, to give anodyne consultations in his
 back-parlour. But the mayor resented it, his colleagues were jealous,
 everything was to be feared; gaining over Monsieur Bovary by his
 attentions was to earn his gratitude, and prevent his speaking out later
 on, should he notice anything. So every morning Homais brought him "the
 paper," and often in the afternoon left his shop for a few moments to have
 a chat with the Doctor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles was dull: patients did not come. He remained seated for hours
 without speaking, went into his consulting room to sleep, or watched his
 wife sewing. Then for diversion he employed himself at home as a workman;
 he even tried to do up the attic with some paint which had been left
 behind by the painters. But money matters worried him. He had spent so
 much for repairs at Tostes, for madame's toilette, and for the moving,
 that the whole dowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped away in two
 years.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then how many things had been spoilt or lost during their carriage from
 Tostes to Yonville, without counting the plaster cure, who falling out of
 the coach at an over-severe jolt, had been dashed into a thousand
 fragments on the pavements of Quincampoix! A pleasanter trouble came to
 distract him, namely, the pregnancy of his wife. As the time of her
 confinement approached he cherished her the more. It was another bond of
 the flesh establishing itself, and, as it were, a continued sentiment of a
 more complex union. When from afar he saw her languid walk, and her figure
 without stays turning softly on her hips; when opposite one another he
 looked at her at his ease, while she took tired poses in her armchair,
 then his happiness knew no bounds; he got up, embraced her, passed his
 hands over her face, called her little mamma, wanted to make her dance,
 and half-laughing, half-crying, uttered all kinds of caressing
 pleasantries that came into his head. The idea of having begotten a child
 delighted him. Now he wanted nothing. He knew human life from end to end,
 and he sat down to it with serenity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma at first felt a great astonishment; then was anxious to be delivered
 that she might know what it was to be a mother. But not being able to
 spend as much as she would have liked, to have a swing-bassinette with
 rose silk curtains, and embroidered caps, in a fit of bitterness she gave
 up looking after the trousseau, and ordered the whole of it from a village
 needlewoman, without choosing or discussing anything. Thus she did not
 amuse herself with those preparations that stimulate the tenderness of
 mothers, and so her affection was from the very outset, perhaps, to some
 extent attenuated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Charles, however, spoke of the boy at every meal, she soon began to
 think of him more consecutively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She hoped for a son; he would be strong and dark; she would call him
 George; and this idea of having a male child was like an expected revenge
 for all her impotence in the past. A man, at least, is free; he may travel
 over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste of the most
 far-away pleasures. But a woman is always hampered. At once inert and
 flexible, she has against her the weakness of the flesh and legal
 dependence. Her will, like the veil of her bonnet, held by a string,
 flutters in every wind; there is always some desire that draws her, some
 conventionality that restrains.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was confined on a Sunday at about six o'clock, as the sun was rising.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is a girl!" said Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned her head away and fainted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or, almost
 immediately came running in to embrace her. The chemist, as man of
 discretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations through the
 half-opened door. He wished to see the child and thought it well made.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst she was getting well she occupied herself much in seeking a name
 for her daughter. First she went over all those that have Italian endings,
 such as Clara, Louisa, Amanda, Atala; she liked Galsuinde pretty well, and
 Yseult or Leocadie still better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles wanted the child to be called after her mother; Emma opposed this.
 They ran over the calendar from end to end, and then consulted outsiders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Leon," said the chemist, "with whom I was talking about it the
 other day, wonders you do not chose Madeleine. It is very much in fashion
 just now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Madame Bovary, senior, cried out loudly against this name of a sinner.
 As to Monsieur Homais, he had a preference for all those that recalled
 some great man, an illustrious fact, or a generous idea, and it was on
 this system that he had baptized his four children. Thus Napoleon
 represented glory and Franklin liberty; Irma was perhaps a concession to
 romanticism, but Athalie was a homage to the greatest masterpiece of the
 French stage. For his philosophical convictions did not interfere with his
 artistic tastes; in him the thinker did not stifle the man of sentiment;
 he could make distinctions, make allowances for imagination and
 fanaticism. In this tragedy, for example, he found fault with the ideas,
 but admired the style; he detested the conception, but applauded all the
 details, and loathed the characters while he grew enthusiastic over their
 dialogue. When he read the fine passages he was transported, but when he
 thought that mummers would get something out of them for their show, he
 was disconsolate; and in this confusion of sentiments in which he was
 involved he would have liked at once to crown Racine with both his hands
 and discuss with him for a good quarter of an hour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard
 the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was
 chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested
 to stand godfather. His gifts were all products from his establishment, to
 wit: six boxes of jujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three cakes of
 marshmallow paste, and six sticks of sugar-candy into the bargain that he
 had come across in a cupboard. On the evening of the ceremony there was a
 grand dinner; the cure was present; there was much excitement. Monsieur
 Homais towards liqueur-time began singing "Le Dieu des bonnes gens."
 Monsieur Leon sang a barcarolle, and Madame Bovary, senior, who was
 godmother, a romance of the time of the Empire; finally, M. Bovary,
 senior, insisted on having the child brought down, and began baptizing it
 with a glass of champagne that he poured over its head. This mockery of
 the first of the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old Bovary
 replied by a quotation from "La Guerre des Dieux"; the cure wanted to
 leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered; and they succeeded in
 making the priest sit down again, and he quietly went on with the
 half-finished coffee in his saucer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Bovary, senior, stayed at Yonville a month, dazzling the natives
 by a superb policeman's cap with silver tassels that he wore in the
 morning when he smoked his pipe in the square. Being also in the habit of
 drinking a good deal of brandy, he often sent the servant to the Lion d'Or
 to buy him a bottle, which was put down to his son's account, and to
 perfume his handkerchiefs he used up his daughter-in-law's whole supply of
 eau-de-cologne.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The latter did not at all dislike his company. He had knocked about the
 world, he talked about Berlin, Vienna, and Strasbourg, of his soldier
 times, of the mistresses he had had, the grand luncheons of which he had
 partaken; then he was amiable, and sometimes even, either on the stairs,
 or in the garden, would seize hold of her waist, crying, "Charles, look
 out for yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Madame Bovary, senior, became alarmed for her son's happiness, and
 fearing that her husband might in the long-run have an immoral influence
 upon the ideas of the young woman, took care to hurry their departure.
 Perhaps she had more serious reasons for uneasiness. Monsieur Bovary was
 not the man to respect anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day Emma was suddenly seized with the desire to see her little girl,
 who had been put to nurse with the carpenter's wife, and, without looking
 at the calendar to see whether the six weeks of the Virgin were yet
 passed, she set out for the Rollets' house, situated at the extreme end of
 the village, between the highroad and the fields.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was mid-day, the shutters of the houses were closed and the slate roofs
 that glittered beneath the fierce light of the blue sky seemed to strike
 sparks from the crest of the gables. A heavy wind was blowing; Emma felt
 weak as she walked; the stones of the pavement hurt her; she was doubtful
 whether she would not go home again, or go in somewhere to rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door with a
 bundle of papers under his arm. He came to greet her, and stood in the
 shade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting grey awning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary said she was going to see her baby, but that she was
 beginning to grow tired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If?" said Leon, not daring to go on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you any business to attend to?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And on the clerk's answer, she begged him to accompany her. That same
 evening this was known in Yonville, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife,
 declared in the presence of her servant that "Madame Bovary was
 compromising herself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To get to the nurse's it was necessary to turn to the left on leaving the
 street, as if making for the cemetery, and to follow between little houses
 and yards a small path bordered with privet hedges. They were in bloom,
 and so were the speedwells, eglantines, thistles, and the sweetbriar that
 sprang up from the thickets. Through openings in the hedges one could see
 into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or tethered cows rubbing their
 horns against the trunk of trees. The two, side by side walked slowly, she
 leaning upon him, and he restraining his pace, which he regulated by hers;
 in front of them a swarm of midges fluttered, buzzing in the warm air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Low and covered with brown tiles, there hung outside it, beneath the
 dormer-window of the garret, a string of onions. Faggots upright against a
 thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce, a few square feet of lavender,
 and sweet peas strung on sticks. Dirty water was running here and there on
 the grass, and all round were several indefinite rags, knitted stockings,
 a red calico jacket, and a large sheet of coarse linen spread over the
 hedge. At the noise of the gate the nurse appeared with a baby she was
 suckling on one arm. With her other hand she was pulling along a poor puny
 little fellow, his face covered with scrofula, the son of a Rouen hosier,
 whom his parents, too taken up with their business, left in the country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go in," she said; "your little one is there asleep."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its
 farther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a
 kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which was
 mended with a piece of blue paper. In the corner behind the door, shining
 hob-nailed shoes stood in a row under the slab of the washstand, near a
 bottle of oil with a feather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu Laensberg lay
 on the dusty mantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and bits of amadou.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, the last luxury in the apartment was a "Fame" blowing her
 trumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt, from some perfumer's prospectus and
 nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma's child was asleep in a wicker-cradle. She took it up in the wrapping
 that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked herself to and
 fro.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see this
 beautiful woman in her nankeen dress in the midst of all this poverty.
 Madam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking perhaps there had been an
 impertinent look in his eyes. Then she put back the little girl, who had
 just been sick over her collar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nurse at once came to dry her, protesting that it wouldn't show.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She gives me other doses," she said: "I am always a-washing of her. If
 you would have the goodness to order Camus, the grocer, to let me have a
 little soap, it would really be more convenient for you, as I needn't
 trouble you then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well! very well!" said Emma. "Good morning, Madame Rollet," and she
 went out, wiping her shoes at the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The good woman accompanied her to the end of the garden, talking all the
 time of the trouble she had getting up of nights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. I'm sure you
 might at least give me just a pound of ground coffee; that'd last me a
 month, and I'd take it of a morning with some milk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After having submitted to her thanks, Madam Bovary left. She had gone a
 little way down the path when, at the sound of wooden shoes, she turned
 round. It was the nurse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the peasant woman, taking her aside behind an elm tree, began talking
 to her of her husband, who with his trade and six francs a year that the
 captain?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, be quick!" said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, "I'm afraid
 he'll be put out seeing me have coffee alone, you know men?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you are to have some," Emma repeated; "I will give you some. You
 bother me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dear! my poor, dear lady! you see in consequence of his wounds he has
 terrible cramps in the chest. He even says that cider weakens him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do make haste, Mere Rollet!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," the latter continued, making a curtsey, "if it weren't asking too
 much," and she curtsied once more, "if you would"?and her eyes
 begged?"a jar of brandy," she said at last, "and I'd rub your little
 one's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once rid of the nurse, Emma again took Monsieur Leon's arm. She walked
 fast for some time, then more slowly, and looking straight in front of
 her, her eyes rested on the shoulder of the young man, whose frock-coat
 had a black-velvety collar. His brown hair fell over it, straight and
 carefully arranged. She noticed his nails which were longer than one wore
 them at Yonville. It was one of the clerk's chief occupations to trim
 them, and for this purpose he kept a special knife in his writing desk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They returned to Yonville by the water-side. In the warm season the bank,
 wider than at other times, showed to their foot the garden walls whence a
 few steps led to the river. It flowed noiselessly, swift, and cold to the
 eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the current drove them,
 and spread themselves upon the limpid water like streaming hair; sometimes
 at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a water-lily an insect with fine
 legs crawled or rested. The sun pierced with a ray the small blue bubbles
 of the waves that, breaking, followed each other; branchless old willows
 mirrored their grey backs in the water; beyond, all around, the meadows
 seemed empty. It was the dinner-hour at the farms, and the young woman and
 her companion heard nothing as they walked but the fall of their steps on
 the earth of the path, the words they spoke, and the sound of Emma's dress
 rustling round her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The walls of the gardens with pieces of bottle on their coping were hot as
 the glass windows of a conservatory. Wallflowers had sprung up between the
 bricks, and with the tip of her open sunshade Madame Bovary, as she
 passed, made some of their faded flowers crumble into a yellow dust, or a
 spray of overhanging honeysuckle and clematis caught in its fringe and
 dangled for a moment over the silk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were talking of a troupe of Spanish dancers who were expected shortly
 at the Rouen theatre.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you going?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I can," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Had they nothing else to say to one another? Yet their eyes were full of
 more serious speech, and while they forced themselves to find trivial
 phrases, they felt the same languor stealing over them both. It was the
 whisper of the soul, deep, continuous, dominating that of their voices.
 Surprised with wonder at this strange sweetness, they did not think of
 speaking of the sensation or of seeking its cause. Coming joys, like
 tropical shores, throw over the immensity before them their inborn
 softness, an odorous wind, and we are lulled by this intoxication without
 a thought of the horizon that we do not even know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In one place the ground had been trodden down by the cattle; they had to
 step on large green stones put here and there in the mud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She often stopped a moment to look where to place her foot, and tottering
 on a stone that shook, her arms outspread, her form bent forward with a
 look of indecision, she would laugh, afraid of falling into the puddles of
 water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they arrived in front of her garden, Madame Bovary opened the little
 gate, ran up the steps and disappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon returned to his office. His chief was away; he just glanced at the
 briefs, then cut himself a pen, and at last took up his hat and went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went to La Pature at the top of the Argueil hills at the beginning of
 the forest; he threw himself upon the ground under the pines and watched
 the sky through his fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How bored I am!" he said to himself, "how bored I am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais for
 a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The latter, entirely absorbed
 by his business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and red whiskers over a
 white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements, although he
 affected a stiff English manner, which in the beginning had impressed the
 clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As to the chemist's spouse, she was the best wife in Normandy, gentle as a
 sheep, loving her children, her father, her mother, her cousins, weeping
 for other's woes, letting everything go in her household, and detesting
 corsets; but so slow of movement, such a bore to listen to, so common in
 appearance, and of such restricted conversation, that although she was
 thirty, he only twenty, although they slept in rooms next each other and
 he spoke to her daily, he never thought that she might be a woman for
 another, or that she possessed anything else of her sex than the gown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And what else was there? Binet, a few shopkeepers, two or three publicans,
 the cure, and finally, Monsieur Tuvache, the mayor, with his two sons,
 rich, crabbed, obtuse persons, who farmed their own lands and had feasts
 among themselves, bigoted to boot, and quite unbearable companions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But from the general background of all these human faces Emma's stood out
 isolated and yet farthest off; for between her and him he seemed to see a
 vague abyss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the beginning he had called on her several times along with the
 druggist. Charles had not appeared particularly anxious to see him again,
 and Leon did not know what to do between his fear of being indiscreet and
 the desire for an intimacy that seemed almost impossible.

 <h2>
 Chapter Four
 </h2>
 <p>
 When the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the
 sitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there was on
 the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the
 looking-glass. Seated in her arm chair near the window, she could see the
 villagers pass along the pavement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Twice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or. Emma could hear
 him coming from afar; she leant forward listening, and the young man
 glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and without
 turning his head. But in the twilight, when, her chin resting on her left
 hand, she let the embroidery she had begun fall on her knees, she often
 shuddered at the apparition of this shadow suddenly gliding past. She
 would get up and order the table to be laid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Homais called at dinner-time. Skull-cap in hand, he came in on
 tiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the same phrase,
 "Good evening, everybody." Then, when he had taken his seat at the table
 between the pair, he asked the doctor about his patients, and the latter
 consulted his as to the probability of their payment. Next they talked of
 "what was in the paper."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais by this hour knew it almost by heart, and he repeated it from end
 to end, with the reflections of the penny-a-liners, and all the stories of
 individual catastrophes that had occurred in France or abroad. But the
 subject becoming exhausted, he was not slow in throwing out some remarks
 on the dishes before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometimes even, half-rising, he delicately pointed out to madame the
 tenderest morsel, or turning to the servant, gave her some advice on the
 manipulation of stews and the hygiene of seasoning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He talked aroma, osmazome, juices, and gelatine in a bewildering manner.
 Moreover, Homais, with his head fuller of recipes than his shop of jars,
 excelled in making all kinds of preserves, vinegars, and sweet liqueurs;
 he knew also all the latest inventions in economic stoves, together with
 the art of preserving cheese and of curing sick wines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At eight o'clock Justin came to fetch him to shut up the shop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Monsieur Homais gave him a sly look, especially if Felicite was
 there, for he half noticed that his apprentice was fond of the doctor's
 house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The young dog," he said, "is beginning to have ideas, and the devil take
 me if I don't believe he's in love with your servant!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But a more serious fault with which he reproached Justin was his
 constantly listening to conversation. On Sunday, for example, one could
 not get him out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais had called him
 to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in the arm-chairs, and
 dragging down with their backs calico chair-covers that were too large.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not many people came to these soirees at the chemist's, his
 scandal-mongering and political opinions having successfully alienated
 various respectable persons from him. The clerk never failed to be there.
 As soon as he heard the bell he ran to meet Madame Bovary, took her shawl,
 and put away under the shop-counter the thick list shoes that she wore
 over her boots when there was snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First they played some hands at trente-et-un; next Monsieur Homais played
 ecarte with Emma; Leon behind her gave her advice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Standing up with his hands on the back of her chair he saw the teeth of
 her comb that bit into her chignon. With every movement that she made to
 throw her cards the right side of her dress was drawn up. From her
 turned-up hair a dark colour fell over her back, and growing gradually
 paler, lost itself little by little in the shade. Then her dress fell on
 both sides of her chair, puffing out full of folds, and reached the
 ground. When Leon occasionally felt the sole of his boot resting on it, he
 drew back as if he had trodden upon some one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor played
 dominoes, and Emma, changing her place, leant her elbow on the table,
 turning over the leaves of "L'Illustration". She had brought her ladies'
 journal with her. Leon sat down near her; they looked at the engravings
 together, and waited for one another at the bottom of the pages. She often
 begged him to read her the verses; Leon declaimed them in a languid voice,
 to which he carefully gave a dying fall in the love passages. But the
 noise of the dominoes annoyed him. Monsieur Homais was strong at the game;
 he could beat Charles and give him a double-six. Then the three hundred
 finished, they both stretched themselves out in front of the fire, and
 were soon asleep. The fire was dying out in the cinders; the teapot was
 empty, Leon was still reading.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma listened to him, mechanically turning around the lampshade, on the
 gauze of which were painted clowns in carriages, and tight-rope dances
 with their balancing-poles. Leon stopped, pointing with a gesture to his
 sleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation
 seemed the more sweet to them because it was unheard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus a kind of bond was established between them, a constant commerce of
 books and of romances. Monsieur Bovary, little given to jealousy, did not
 trouble himself about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On his birthday he received a beautiful phrenological head, all marked
 with figures to the thorax and painted blue. This was an attention of the
 clerk's. He showed him many others, even to doing errands for him at
 Rouen; and the book of a novelist having made the mania for cactuses
 fashionable, Leon bought some for Madame Bovary, bringing them back on his
 knees in the "Hirondelle," pricking his fingers on their hard hairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had a board with a balustrade fixed against her window to hold the
 pots. The clerk, too, had his small hanging garden; they saw each other
 tending their flowers at their windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of the windows of the village there was one yet more often occupied; for
 on Sundays from morning to night, and every morning when the weather was
 bright, one could see at the dormer-window of the garret the profile of
 Monsieur Binet bending over his lathe, whose monotonous humming could be
 heard at the Lion d'Or.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening on coming home Leon found in his room a rug in velvet and wool
 with leaves on a pale ground. He called Madame Homais, Monsieur Homais,
 Justin, the children, the cook; he spoke of it to his chief; every one
 wanted to see this rug. Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents?
 It looked queer. They decided that she must be his lover.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He made this seem likely, so ceaselessly did he talk of her charms and of
 her wit; so much so, that Binet once roughly answered him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does it matter to me since I'm not in her set?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to her,
 and always halting between the fear of displeasing her and the shame of
 being such a coward, he wept with discouragement and desire. Then he took
 energetic resolutions, wrote letters that he tore up, put it off to times
 that he again deferred.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Often he set out with the determination to dare all; but this resolution
 soon deserted him in Emma's presence, and when Charles, dropping in,
 invited him to jump into his chaise to go with him to see some patient in
 the neighbourhood, he at once accepted, bowed to madame, and went out. Her
 husband, was he not something belonging to her? As to Emma, she did not
 ask herself whether she loved. Love, she thought, must come suddenly, with
 great outbursts and lightnings?a hurricane of the skies, which falls
 upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps
 the whole heart into the abyss. She did not know that on the terrace of
 houses it makes lakes when the pipes are choked, and she would thus have
 remained in her security when she suddenly discovered a rent in the wall
 of it.

 <h2>
 Chapter Five
 </h2>
 <h3>
 It was a Sunday in February, an afternoon when the snow was falling.
 </h3>
 <p>
 They had all, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Homais, and Monsieur Leon, gone
 to see a yarn-mill that was being built in the valley a mile and a half
 from Yonville. The druggist had taken Napoleon and Athalie to give them
 some exercise, and Justin accompanied them, carrying the umbrellas on his
 shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing, however, could be less curious than this curiosity. A great piece
 of waste ground, on which pell-mell, amid a mass of sand and stones, were
 a few break-wheels, already rusty, surrounded by a quadrangular building
 pierced by a number of little windows. The building was unfinished; the
 sky could be seen through the joists of the roofing. Attached to the
 stop-plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed with corn-ears fluttered
 its tricoloured ribbons in the wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais was talking. He explained to the company the future importance of
 this establishment, computed the strength of the floorings, the thickness
 of the walls, and regretted extremely not having a yard-stick such as
 Monsieur Binet possessed for his own special use.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, who had taken his arm, bent lightly against his shoulder, and she
 looked at the sun's disc shedding afar through the mist his pale
 splendour. She turned. Charles was there. His cap was drawn down over his
 eyebrows, and his two thick lips were trembling, which added a look of
 stupidity to his face; his very back, his calm back, was irritating to
 behold, and she saw written upon his coat all the platitude of the bearer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While she was considering him thus, tasting in her irritation a sort of
 depraved pleasure, Leon made a step forward. The cold that made him pale
 seemed to add a more gentle languor to his face; between his cravat and
 his neck the somewhat loose collar of his shirt showed the skin; the lobe
 of his ear looked out from beneath a lock of hair, and his large blue
 eyes, raised to the clouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and more beautiful
 than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wretched boy!" suddenly cried the chemist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he ran to his son, who had just precipitated himself into a heap of
 lime in order to whiten his boots. At the reproaches with which he was
 being overwhelmed Napoleon began to roar, while Justin dried his shoes
 with a wisp of straw. But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" she said to herself, "he carried a knife in his pocket like a
 peasant."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hoar-frost was falling, and they turned back to Yonville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her neighbour's, and when
 Charles had left and she felt herself alone, the comparison re-began with
 the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and with that lengthening of
 perspective which memory gives to things. Looking from her bed at the
 clean fire that was burning, she still saw, as she had down there, Leon
 standing up with one hand behind his cane, and with the other holding
 Athalie, who was quietly sucking a piece of ice. She thought him charming;
 she could not tear herself away from him; she recalled his other attitudes
 on other days, the words he had spoken, the sound of his voice, his whole
 person; and she repeated, pouting out her lips as if for a kiss?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, charming! charming! Is he not in love?" she asked herself; "but with
 whom? With me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the proofs arose before her at once; her heart leapt. The flame of the
 fire threw a joyous light upon the ceiling; she turned on her back,
 stretching out her arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then began the eternal lamentation: "Oh, if Heaven had out willed it! And
 why not? What prevented it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Charles came home at midnight, she seemed to have just awakened, and
 as he made a noise undressing, she complained of a headache, then asked
 carelessly what had happened that evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Leon," he said, "went to his room early."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could not help smiling, and she fell asleep, her soul filled with a
 new delight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day, at dusk, she received a visit from Monsieur Lherueux, the
 draper. He was a man of ability, was this shopkeeper. Born a Gascon but
 bred a Norman, he grafted upon his southern volubility the cunning of the
 Cauchois. His fat, flabby, beardless face seemed dyed by a decoction of
 liquorice, and his white hair made even more vivid the keen brilliance of
 his small black eyes. No one knew what he had been formerly; a pedlar said
 some, a banker at Routot according to others. What was certain was that he
 made complex calculations in his head that would have frightened Binet
 himself. Polite to obsequiousness, he always held himself with his back
 bent in the position of one who bows or who invites.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After leaving at the door his hat surrounded with crape, he put down a
 green bandbox on the table, and began by complaining to madame, with many
 civilities, that he should have remained till that day without gaining her
 confidence. A poor shop like his was not made to attract a "fashionable
 lady"; he emphasized the words; yet she had only to command, and he would
 undertake to provide her with anything she might wish, either in
 haberdashery or linen, millinery or fancy goods, for he went to town
 regularly four times a month. He was connected with the best houses. You
 could speak of him at the "Trois Freres," at the "Barbe d'Or," or at the
 "Grand Sauvage"; all these gentlemen knew him as well as the insides of
 their pockets. To-day, then he had come to show madame, in passing,
 various articles he happened to have, thanks to the most rare opportunity.
 And he pulled out half-a-dozen embroidered collars from the box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary examined them. "I do not require anything," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian scarves,
 several packets of English needles, a pair of straw slippers, and finally,
 four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in open work by convicts. Then, with
 both hands on the table, his neck stretched out, his figure bent forward,
 open-mouthed, he watched Emma's look, who was walking up and down
 undecided amid these goods. From time to time, as if to remove some dust,
 he filliped with his nail the silk of the scarves spread out at full
 length, and they rustled with a little noise, making in the green twilight
 the gold spangles of their tissue scintillate like little stars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much are they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A mere nothing," he replied, "a mere nothing. But there's no hurry;
 whenever it's convenient. We are not Jews."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur
 Lheureux's offer. He replied quite unconcernedly?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well. We shall understand one another by and by. I have always got
 on with ladies?if I didn't with my own!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma smiled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wanted to tell you," he went on good-naturedly, after his joke, "that
 it isn't the money I should trouble about. Why, I could give you some, if
 need be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She made a gesture of surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said he quickly and in a low voice, "I shouldn't have to go far to
 find you some, rely on that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he began asking after Pere Tellier, the proprietor of the "Cafe
 Francais," whom Monsieur Bovary was then attending.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter with Pere Tellier? He coughs so that he shakes his
 whole house, and I'm afraid he'll soon want a deal covering rather than a
 flannel vest. He was such a rake as a young man! Those sort of people,
 madame, have not the least regularity; he's burnt up with brandy. Still
 it's sad, all the same, to see an acquaintance go off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And while he fastened up his box he discoursed about the doctor's
 patients.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the weather, no doubt," he said, looking frowningly at the floor,
 "that causes these illnesses. I, too, don't feel the thing. One of these
 days I shall even have to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my back.
 Well, good-bye, Madame Bovary. At your service; your very humble servant."
 And he closed the door gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the fireside; she
 was a long time over it; everything was well with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How good I was!" she said to herself, thinking of the scarves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She heard some steps on the stairs. It was Leon. She got up and took from
 the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be hemmed. When he came
 in she seemed very busy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The conversation languished; Madame Bovary gave it up every few minutes,
 whilst he himself seemed quite embarrassed. Seated on a low chair near the
 fire, he turned round in his fingers the ivory thimble-case. She stitched
 on, or from time to time turned down the hem of the cloth with her nail.
 She did not speak; he was silent, captivated by her silence, as he would
 have been by her speech.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor fellow!" she thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How have I displeased her?" he asked himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, however, Leon said that he should have, one of these days, to go
 to Rouen on some office business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your music subscription is out; am I to renew it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And pursing her lips she slowly drew a long stitch of grey thread.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This work irritated Leon. It seemed to roughen the ends of her fingers. A
 gallant phrase came into his head, but he did not risk it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you are giving it up?" he went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?" she asked hurriedly. "Music? Ah! yes! Have I not my house to look
 after, my husband to attend to, a thousand things, in fact, many duties
 that must be considered first?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked at the clock. Charles was late. Then, she affected anxiety. Two
 or three times she even repeated, "He is so good!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. But this tenderness on his behalf
 astonished him unpleasantly; nevertheless he took up on his praises, which
 he said everyone was singing, especially the chemist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! he is a good fellow," continued Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly," replied the clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he began talking of Madame Homais, whose very untidy appearance
 generally made them laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does it matter?" interrupted Emma. "A good housewife does not
 trouble about her appearance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she relapsed into silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the same on the following days; her talks, her manners, everything
 changed. She took interest in the housework, went to church regularly, and
 looked after her servant with more severity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took Berthe from nurse. When visitors called, Felicite brought her in,
 and Madame Bovary undressed her to show off her limbs. She declared she
 adored children; this was her consolation, her joy, her passion, and she
 accompanied her caresses with lyrical outburst which would have reminded
 anyone but the Yonville people of Sachette in "Notre Dame de Paris."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Charles came home he found his slippers put to warm near the fire.
 His waistcoat now never wanted lining, nor his shirt buttons, and it was
 quite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the night-caps arranged in piles
 of the same height. She no longer grumbled as formerly at taking a turn in
 the garden; what he proposed was always done, although she did not
 understand the wishes to which she submitted without a murmur; and when
 Leon saw him by his fireside after dinner, his two hands on his stomach,
 his two feet on the fender, his two cheeks red with feeding, his eyes
 moist with happiness, the child crawling along the carpet, and this woman
 with the slender waist who came behind his arm-chair to kiss his forehead:
 "What madness!" he said to himself. "And how to reach her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he lost all
 hope, even the faintest. But by this renunciation he placed her on an
 extraordinary pinnacle. To him she stood outside those fleshly attributes
 from which he had nothing to obtain, and in his heart she rose ever, and
 became farther removed from him after the magnificent manner of an
 apotheosis that is taking wing. It was one of those pure feelings that do
 not interfere with life, that are cultivated because they are rare, and
 whose loss would afflict more than their passion rejoices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma grew thinner, her cheeks paler, her face longer. With her black hair,
 her large eyes, her aquiline nose, her birdlike walk, and always silent
 now, did she not seem to be passing through life scarcely touching it, and
 to bear on her brow the vague impress of some divine destiny? She was so
 sad and so calm, at once so gentle and so reserved, that near her one felt
 oneself seized by an icy charm, as we shudder in churches at the perfume
 of the flowers mingling with the cold of the marble. The others even did
 not escape from this seduction. The chemist said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is a woman of great parts, who wouldn't be misplaced in a
 sub-prefecture."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The housewives admired her economy, the patients her politeness, the poor
 her charity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That dress with
 the narrow folds hid a distracted fear, of whose torment those chaste lips
 said nothing. She was in love with Leon, and sought solitude that she
 might with the more ease delight in his image. The sight of his form
 troubled the voluptuousness of this mediation. Emma thrilled at the sound
 of his step; then in his presence the emotion subsided, and afterwards
 there remained to her only an immense astonishment that ended in sorrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon did not know that when he left her in despair she rose after he had
 gone to see him in the street. She concerned herself about his comings and
 goings; she watched his face; she invented quite a history to find an
 excuse for going to his room. The chemist's wife seemed happy to her to
 sleep under the same roof, and her thoughts constantly centered upon this
 house, like the "Lion d'Or" pigeons, who came there to dip their red feet
 and white wings in its gutters. But the more Emma recognised her love, the
 more she crushed it down, that it might not be evident, that she might
 make it less. She would have liked Leon to guess it, and she imagined
 chances, catastrophes that should facilitate this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What restrained her was, no doubt, idleness and fear, and a sense of shame
 also. She thought she had repulsed him too much, that the time was past,
 that all was lost. Then, pride, and joy of being able to say to herself,
 "I am virtuous," and to look at herself in the glass taking resigned
 poses, consoled her a little for the sacrifice she believed she was
 making.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the melancholy of
 passion all blended themselves into one suffering, and instead of turning
 her thoughts from it, she clave to it the more, urging herself to pain,
 and seeking everywhere occasion for it. She was irritated by an ill-served
 dish or by a half-open door; bewailed the velvets she had not, the
 happiness she had missed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her anguish.
 His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her an imbecile
 insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. For whose sake, then
 was she virtuous? Was it not for him, the obstacle to all felicity, the
 cause of all misery, and, as it were, the sharp clasp of that complex
 strap that bucked her in on all sides.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On him alone, then, she concentrated all the various hatreds that resulted
 from her boredom, and every effort to diminish only augmented it; for this
 useless trouble was added to the other reasons for despair, and
 contributed still more to the separation between them. Her own gentleness
 to herself made her rebel against him. Domestic mediocrity drove her to
 lewd fancies, marriage tenderness to adulterous desires. She would have
 liked Charles to beat her, that she might have a better right to hate him,
 to revenge herself upon him. She was surprised sometimes at the atrocious
 conjectures that came into her thoughts, and she had to go on smiling, to
 hear repeated to her at all hours that she was happy, to pretend to be
 happy, to let it be believed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet she had loathing of this hypocrisy. She was seized with the temptation
 to flee somewhere with Leon to try a new life; but at once a vague chasm
 full of darkness opened within her soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides, he no longer loves me," she thought. "What is to become of me?
 What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with
 flowing tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you tell master?" the servant asked her when she came in during
 these crises.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is the nerves," said Emma. "Do not speak to him of it; it would worry
 him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! yes," Felicite went on, "you are just like La Guerine, Pere Guerin's
 daughter, the fisherman at Pollet, that I used to know at Dieppe before I
 came to you. She was so sad, so sad, to see her standing upright on the
 threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a winding-sheet spread out
 before the door. Her illness, it appears, was a kind of fog that she had
 in her head, and the doctors could not do anything, nor the priest either.
 When she was taken too bad she went off quite alone to the sea-shore, so
 that the customs officer, going his rounds, often found her lying flat on
 her face, crying on the shingle. Then, after her marriage, it went off,
 they say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But with me," replied Emma, "it was after marriage that it began."
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter Six
 </h2>
 <p>
 One evening when the window was open, and she, sitting by it, had been
 watching Lestiboudois, the beadle, trimming the box, she suddenly heard
 the Angelus ringing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom, and a warm
 wind blows over the flower-beds newly turned, and the gardens, like women,
 seem to be getting ready for the summer fetes. Through the bars of the
 arbour and away beyond, the river seen in the fields, meandering through
 the grass in wandering curves. The evening vapours rose between the
 leafless poplars, touching their outlines with a violet tint, paler and
 more transparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches. In the
 distance cattle moved about; neither their steps nor their lowing could be
 heard; and the bell, still ringing through the air, kept up its peaceful
 lamentation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With this repeated tinkling the thoughts of the young woman lost
 themselves in old memories of her youth and school-days. She remembered
 the great candlesticks that rose above the vases full of flowers on the
 altar, and the tabernacle with its small columns. She would have liked to
 be once more lost in the long line of white veils, marked off here and
 there by the stuff black hoods of the good sisters bending over their
 prie-Dieu. At mass on Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the gentle face
 of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense. Then she was
 moved; she felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the down of a bird
 whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she went towards the
 church, included to no matter what devotions, so that her soul was
 absorbed and all existence lost in it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Place she met Lestivoudois on his way back, for, in order not to
 shorten his day's labour, he preferred interrupting his work, then
 beginning it again, so that he rang the Angelus to suit his own
 convenience. Besides, the ringing over a little earlier warned the lads of
 catechism hour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Already a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the
 cemetery. Others, astride the wall, swung their legs, kicking with their
 clogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and the
 newest graves. This was the only green spot. All the rest was but stones,
 always covered with a fine powder, despite the vestry-broom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure made
 for them. The shouts of their voices could be heard through the humming of
 the bell. This grew less and less with the swinging of the great rope
 that, hanging from the top of the belfry, dragged its end on the ground.
 Swallows flitted to and fro uttering little cries, cut the air with the
 edge of their wings, and swiftly returned to their yellow nests under the
 tiles of the coping. At the end of the church a lamp was burning, the wick
 of a night-light in a glass hung up. Its light from a distance looked like
 a white stain trembling in the oil. A long ray of the sun fell across the
 nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and the corners.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is the cure?" asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who was
 amusing himself by shaking a swivel in a hole too large for it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is just coming," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in fact the door of the presbytery grated; Abbe Bournisien appeared;
 the children, pell-mell, fled into the church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These young scamps!" murmured the priest, "always the same!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, picking up a catechism all in rags that he had struck with is foot,
 "They respect nothing!" But as soon as he caught sight of Madame Bovary,
 "Excuse me," he said; "I did not recognise you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He thrust the catechism into his pocket, and stopped short, balancing the
 heavy vestry key between his two fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The light of the setting sun that fell full upon his face paled the
 lasting of his cassock, shiny at the elbows, unravelled at the hem. Grease
 and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest the lines of the
 buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they were from his neckcloth,
 in which the massive folds of his red chin rested; this was dotted with
 yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of his greyish
 beard. He had just dined and was breathing noisily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you?" he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not well," replied Emma; "I am ill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and so am I," answered the priest. "These first warm days weaken
 one most remarkably, don't they? But, after all, we are born to suffer, as
 St. Paul says. But what does Monsieur Bovary think of it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He!" she said with a gesture of contempt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" replied the good fellow, quite astonished, "doesn't he prescribe
 something for you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Emma, "it is no earthly remedy I need."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the kneeling
 boys were shouldering one another, and tumbling over like packs of cards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to know?" she went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You look out, Riboudet," cried the priest in an angry voice; "I'll warm
 your ears, you imp!" Then turning to Emma, "He's Boudet the carpenter's
 son; his parents are well off, and let him do just as he pleases. Yet he
 could learn quickly if he would, for he is very sharp. And so sometimes
 for a joke I call him Riboudet (like the road one takes to go to Maromme)
 and I even say 'Mon Riboudet.' Ha! Ha! 'Mont Riboudet.' The other day I
 repeated that just to Monsignor, and he laughed at it; he condescended to
 laugh at it. And how is Monsieur Bovary?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed not to hear him. And he went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Always very busy, no doubt; for he and I are certainly the busiest people
 in the parish. But he is doctor of the body," he added with a thick laugh,
 "and I of the soul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest. "Yes," she said, "you solace
 all sorrows."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! don't talk to me of it, Madame Bovary. This morning I had to go to
 Bas-Diauville for a cow that was ill; they thought it was under a spell.
 All their cows, I don't know how it is?But pardon me! Longuemarre
 and Boudet! Bless me! Will you leave off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And with a bound he ran into the church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing over the
 precentor's footstool, opening the missal; and others on tiptoe were just
 about to venture into the confessional. But the priest suddenly
 distributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing them by the collars of
 their coats, he lifted them from the ground, and deposited them on their
 knees on the stones of the choir, firmly, as if he meant planting them
 there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said he, when he returned to Emma, unfolding his large cotton
 handkerchief, one corner of which he put between his teeth, "farmers are
 much to be pitied."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Others, too," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Assuredly. Town-labourers, for example."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon! I've there known poor mothers of families, virtuous women, I
 assure you, real saints, who wanted even bread."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But those," replied Emma, and the corners of her mouth twitched as she
 spoke, "those, Monsieur le Cure, who have bread and have no?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fire in the winter," said the priest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, what does that matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! What does it matter? It seems to me that when one has firing and
 food?for, after all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My God! my God!" she sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is indigestion, no doubt? You must get home, Madame Bovary; drink a
 little tea, that will strengthen you, or else a glass of fresh water with
 a little moist sugar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" And she looked like one awaking from a dream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I thought you
 felt faint." Then, bethinking himself, "But you were asking me something?
 What was it? I really don't remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I? Nothing! nothing!" repeated Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the glance she cast round her slowly fell upon the old man in the
 cassock. They looked at one another face to face without speaking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, Madame Bovary," he said at last, "excuse me, but duty first, you
 know; I must look after my good-for-nothings. The first communion will
 soon be upon us, and I fear we shall be behind after all. So after
 Ascension Day I keep them recta* an extra hour every Wednesday. Poor
 children! One cannot lead them too soon into the path of the Lord, as,
 moreover, he has himself recommended us to do by the mouth of his Divine
 Son. Good health to you, madame; my respects to your husband."
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *On the straight and narrow path.
</pre>
 <p>
 And he went into the church making a genuflexion as soon as he reached the
 door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma saw him disappear between the double row of forms, walking with a
 heavy tread, his head a little bent over his shoulder, and with his two
 hands half-open behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she turned on her heel all of one piece, like a statue on a pivot,
 and went homewards. But the loud voice of the priest, the clear voices of
 the boys still reached her ears, and went on behind her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you a Christian?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am a Christian."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is a Christian?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He who, being baptized-baptized-baptized?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went up the steps of the staircase holding on to the banisters, and
 when she was in her room threw herself into an arm-chair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The furniture in its place seemed to have become more immobile, and to
 lose itself in the shadow as in an ocean of darkness. The fire was out,
 the clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of all
 things while within herself was such tumult. But little Berthe was there,
 between the window and the work-table, tottering on her knitted shoes, and
 trying to come to her mother to catch hold of the ends of her
 apron-strings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave me alone," said the latter, putting her from her with her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little girl soon came up closer against her knees, and leaning on them
 with her arms, she looked up with her large blue eyes, while a small
 thread of pure saliva dribbled from her lips on to the silk apron.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave me alone," repeated the young woman quite irritably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her face frightened the child, who began to scream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you leave me alone?" she said, pushing her with her elbow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Berthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting
 her cheek, which began to bleed, against it. Madame Bovary sprang to lift
 her up, broke the bell-rope, called for the servant with all her might,
 and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared. It was the
 dinner-hour; he had come home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look, dear!" said Emma, in a calm voice, "the little one fell down while
 she was playing, and has hurt herself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles reassured her; the case was not a serious one, and he went for
 some sticking plaster.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room; she wished to
 remain alone to look after the child. Then watching her sleep, the little
 anxiety she felt gradually wore off, and she seemed very stupid to
 herself, and very good to have been so worried just now at so little.
 Berthe, in fact, no longer sobbed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her breathing now imperceptibly raised the cotton covering. Big tears lay
 in the corner of the half-closed eyelids, through whose lashes one could
 see two pale sunken pupils; the plaster stuck on her cheek drew the skin
 obliquely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is very strange," thought Emma, "how ugly this child is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When at eleven o'clock Charles came back from the chemist's shop, whither
 he had gone after dinner to return the remainder of the sticking-plaster,
 he found his wife standing by the cradle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I assure you it's nothing." he said, kissing her on the forehead. "Don't
 worry, my poor darling; you will make yourself ill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had stayed a long time at the chemist's. Although he had not seemed
 much moved, Homais, nevertheless, had exerted himself to buoy him up, to
 "keep up his spirits." Then they had talked of the various dangers that
 threaten childhood, of the carelessness of servants. Madame Homais knew
 something of it, having still upon her chest the marks left by a basin
 full of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on her pinafore, and her
 good parents took no end of trouble for her. The knives were not
 sharpened, nor the floors waxed; there were iron gratings to the windows
 and strong bars across the fireplace; the little Homais, in spite of their
 spirit, could not stir without someone watching them; at the slightest
 cold their father stuffed them with pectorals; and until they were turned
 four they all, without pity, had to wear wadded head-protectors. This, it
 is true, was a fancy of Madame Homais'; her husband was inwardly afflicted
 at it. Fearing the possible consequences of such compression to the
 intellectual organs. He even went so far as to say to her, "Do you want to
 make Caribs or Botocudos of them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, however, had several times tried to interrupt the conversation.
 "I should like to speak to you," he had whispered in the clerk's ear, who
 went upstairs in front of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can he suspect anything?" Leon asked himself. His heart beat, and he
 racked his brain with surmises.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, Charles, having shut the door, asked him to see himself what
 would be the price at Rouen of a fine daguerreotypes. It was a sentimental
 surprise he intended for his wife, a delicate attention?his portrait
 in a frock-coat. But he wanted first to know "how much it would be." The
 inquiries would not put Monsieur Leon out, since he went to town almost
 every week.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Why? Monsieur Homais suspected some "young man's affair" at the bottom of
 it, an intrigue. But he was mistaken. Leon was after no love-making. He
 was sadder than ever, as Madame Lefrancois saw from the amount of food he
 left on his plate. To find out more about it she questioned the
 tax-collector. Binet answered roughly that he "wasn't paid by the police."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon often
 threw himself back in his chair, and stretching out his arms. Complained
 vaguely of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because you don't take enough recreation," said the collector.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What recreation?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I were you I'd have a lathe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I don't know how to turn," answered the clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! that's true," said the other, rubbing his chin with an air of mingled
 contempt and satisfaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was beginning to
 feel that depression caused by the repetition of the same kind of life,
 when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He was so bored with
 Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons, of
 certain houses, irritated him beyond endurance; and the chemist, good
 fellow though he was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to him. Yet the
 prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar
 sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes. As he was
 to finish reading there, why not set out at once? What prevented him? And
 he began making home-preparations; he arranged his occupations beforehand.
 He furnished in his head an apartment. He would lead an artist's life
 there! He would take lessons on the guitar! He would have a dressing-gown,
 a Basque cap, blue velvet slippers! He even already was admiring two
 crossed foils over his chimney-piece, with a death's head on the guitar
 above them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The difficulty was the consent of his mother; nothing, however, seemed
 more reasonable. Even his employer advised him to go to some other
 chambers where he could advance more rapidly. Taking a middle course,
 then, Leon looked for some place as second clerk at Rouen; found none, and
 at last wrote his mother a long letter full of details, in which he set
 forth the reasons for going to live at Paris immediately. She consented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes, valises,
 parcels for him from Yonville to Rouen and from Rouen to Yonville; and
 when Leon had packed up his wardrobe, had his three arm-chairs restuffed,
 bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had made more preparations than for
 a voyage around the world, he put it off from week to week, until he
 received a second letter from his mother urging him to leave, since he
 wanted to pass his examination before the vacation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the moment for the farewells had come, Madame Homais wept, Justin
 sobbed; Homais, as a man of nerve, concealed his emotion; he wished to
 carry his friend's overcoat himself as far as the gate of the notary, who
 was taking Leon to Rouen in his carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The latter had just time to bid farewell to Monsieur Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the head of the stairs, he stopped, he was so out of
 breath. As he came in, Madame Bovary arose hurriedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is I again!" said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was sure of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She bit her lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her skin made her red
 from the roots of her hair to the top of her collar. She remained
 standing, leaning with her shoulder against the wainscot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The doctor is not here?" he went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is out." She repeated, "He is out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then there was silence. They looked at one another and their thoughts,
 confounded in the same agony, clung close together like two throbbing
 breasts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to kiss Berthe," said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma went down a few steps and called Felicite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He threw one long look around him that took in the walls, the decorations,
 the fireplace, as if to penetrate everything, carry away everything. But
 she returned, and the servant brought Berthe, who was swinging a windmill
 roof downwards at the end of a string. Leon kissed her several times on
 the neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!" And he gave
 her back to her mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take her away," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They remained alone?Madame Bovary, her back turned, her face pressed
 against a window-pane; Leon held his cap in his hand, knocking it softly
 against his thigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is going to rain," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have a cloak," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The light fell on it as on a piece of marble, to the curve of the
 eyebrows, without one's being able to guess what Emma was seeing on the
 horizon or what she was thinking within herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, good-bye," he sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She raised her head with a quick movement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, good-bye?go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They advanced towards each other; he held out his hand; she hesitated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the English fashion, then," she said, giving her own hand wholly to
 him, and forcing a laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon felt it between his fingers, and the very essence of all his being
 seemed to pass down into that moist palm. Then he opened his hand; their
 eyes met again, and he disappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the market-place, he stopped and hid behind a pillar to
 look for the last time at this white house with the four green blinds. He
 thought he saw a shadow behind the window in the room; but the curtain,
 sliding along the pole as though no one were touching it, slowly opened
 its long oblique folds that spread out with a single movement, and thus
 hung straight and motionless as a plaster wall. Leon set off running.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From afar he saw his employer's gig in the road, and by it a man in a
 coarse apron holding the horse. Homais and Monsieur Guillaumin were
 talking. They were waiting for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Embrace me," said the druggist with tears in his eyes. "Here is your
 coat, my good friend. Mind the cold; take care of yourself; look after
 yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, Leon, jump in," said the notary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais bend over the splash-board, and in a voice broken by sobs uttered
 these three sad words?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A pleasant journey!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-night," said Monsieur Guillaumin. "Give him his head." They set out,
 and Homais went back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary had opened her window overlooking the garden and watched the
 clouds. They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and then
 swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the great rays of
 the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy, while the
 rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain. But a gust of wind bowed
 the poplars, and suddenly the rain fell; it pattered against the green
 leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in
 the damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed
 away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! how far off he must be already!" she thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Homais, as usual, came at half-past six during dinner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said he, "so we've sent off our young friend!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So it seems," replied the doctor. Then turning on his chair; "Any news at
 home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing much. Only my wife was a little moved this afternoon. You know
 women?a nothing upsets them, especially my wife. And we should be
 wrong to object to that, since their nervous organization is much more
 malleable than ours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Leon!" said Charles. "How will he live at Paris? Will he get used to
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get along!" said the chemist, smacking his lips. "The outings at
 restaurants, the masked balls, the champagne?all that'll be jolly
 enough, I assure you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think he'll go wrong," objected Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor do I," said Monsieur Homais quickly; "although he'll have to do like
 the rest for fear of passing for a Jesuit. And you don't know what a life
 those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with actresses. Besides, students are
 thought a great deal of in Paris. Provided they have a few
 accomplishments, they are received in the best society; there are even
 ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which
 subsequently furnishes them opportunities for making very good matches."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," said the doctor, "I fear for him that down there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are right," interrupted the chemist; "that is the reverse of the
 medal. And one is constantly obliged to keep one's hand in one's pocket
 there. Thus, we will suppose you are in a public garden. An individual
 presents himself, well dressed, even wearing an order, and whom one would
 take for a diplomatist. He approaches you, he insinuates himself; offers
 you a pinch of snuff, or picks up your hat. Then you become more intimate;
 he takes you to a cafe, invites you to his country-house, introduces you,
 between two drinks, to all sorts of people; and three-fourths of the time
 it's only to plunder your watch or lead you into some pernicious step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true," said Charles; "but I was thinking especially of illnesses?of
 typhoid fever, for example, that attacks students from the provinces."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma shuddered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because of the change of regimen," continued the chemist, "and of the
 perturbation that results therefrom in the whole system. And then the
 water at Paris, don't you know! The dishes at restaurants, all the spiced
 food, end by heating the blood, and are not worth, whatever people may say
 of them, a good soup. For my own part, I have always preferred plain
 living; it is more healthy. So when I was studying pharmacy at Rouen, I
 boarded in a boarding house; I dined with the professors."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And thus he went on, expounding his opinions generally and his personal
 likings, until Justin came to fetch him for a mulled egg that was wanted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not a moment's peace!" he cried; "always at it! I can't go out for a
 minute! Like a plough-horse, I have always to be moiling and toiling. What
 drudgery!" Then, when he was at the door, "By the way, do you know the
 news?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What news?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That it is very likely," Homais went on, raising his eyebrows and
 assuming one of his most serious expression, "that the agricultural
 meeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this year at
 Yonville-l'Abbaye. The rumour, at all events, is going the round. This
 morning the paper alluded to it. It would be of the utmost importance for
 our district. But we'll talk it over later on. I can see, thank you;
 Justin has the lantern."

 <h2>
 Chapter Seven
 </h2>
 <p>
 The next day was a dreary one for Emma. Everything seemed to her enveloped
 in a black atmosphere floating confusedly over the exterior of things, and
 sorrow was engulfed within her soul with soft shrieks such as the winter
 wind makes in ruined castles. It was that reverie which we give to things
 that will not return, the lassitude that seizes you after everything was
 done; that pain, in fine, that the interruption of every wonted movement,
 the sudden cessation of any prolonged vibration, brings on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As on the return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles were running in her
 head, she was full of a gloomy melancholy, of a numb despair. Leon
 reappeared, taller, handsomer, more charming, more vague. Though separated
 from her, he had not left her; he was there, and the walls of the house
 seemed to hold his shadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could not detach her eyes from the carpet where he had walked, from
 those empty chairs where he had sat. The river still flowed on, and slowly
 drove its ripples along the slippery banks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had often walked there to the murmur of the waves over the
 moss-covered pebbles. How bright the sun had been! What happy afternoons
 they had seen alone in the shade at the end of the garden! He read aloud,
 bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry sticks; the fresh wind of the
 meadow set trembling the leaves of the book and the nasturtiums of the
 arbour. Ah! he was gone, the only charm of her life, the only possible
 hope of joy. Why had she not seized this happiness when it came to her?
 Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was
 about to flee from her? And she cursed herself for not having loved Leon.
 She thirsted for his lips. The wish took possession of her to run after
 and rejoin him, throw herself into his arms and say to him, "It is I; I am
 yours." But Emma recoiled beforehand at the difficulties of the
 enterprise, and her desires, increased by regret, became only the more
 acute.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Henceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it burnt
 there more brightly than the fire travellers have left on the snow of a
 Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed against him, she
 stirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her anything that
 could revive it; and the most distant reminiscences, like the most
 immediate occasions, what she experienced as well as what she imagined,
 her voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness
 that crackled in the wind like dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her lost
 hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete?she gathered it all up, took
 everything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The flames, however, subsided, either because the supply had exhausted
 itself, or because it had been piled up too much. Love, little by little,
 was quelled by absence; regret stifled beneath habit; and this incendiary
 light that had empurpled her pale sky was overspread and faded by degrees.
 In the supineness of her conscience she even took her repugnance towards
 her husband for aspirations towards her lover, the burning of hate for the
 warmth of tenderness; but as the tempest still raged, and as passion burnt
 itself down to the very cinders, and no help came, no sun rose, there was
 night on all sides, and she was lost in the terrible cold that pierced
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the evil days of Tostes began again. She thought herself now far more
 unhappy; for she had the experience of grief, with the certainty that it
 would not end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow herself
 certain whims. She bought a Gothic prie-dieu, and in a month spent
 fourteen francs on lemons for polishing her nails; she wrote to Rouen for
 a blue cashmere gown; she chose one of Lheureux's finest scarves, and wore
 it knotted around her waist over her dressing-gown; and, with closed
 blinds and a book in her hand, she lay stretched out on a couch in this
 garb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She often changed her coiffure; she did her hair a la Chinoise, in flowing
 curls, in plaited coils; she parted in on one side and rolled it under
 like a man's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She wanted to learn Italian; she bought dictionaries, a grammar, and a
 supply of white paper. She tried serious reading, history, and philosophy.
 Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a start, thinking he was being
 called to a patient. "I'm coming," he stammered; and it was the noise of a
 match Emma had struck to relight the lamp. But her reading fared like her
 piece of embroidery, all of which, only just begun, filled her cupboard;
 she took it up, left it, passed on to other books.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had attacks in which she could easily have been driven to commit any
 folly. She maintained one day, in opposition to her husband, that she
 could drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid enough
 to dare her to, she swallowed the brandy to the last drop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville called
 them), Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually she had at the
 corners of her mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the faces of
 old maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed. She was pale all
 over, white as a sheet; the skin of her nose was drawn at the nostrils,
 her eyes looked at you vaguely. After discovering three grey hairs on her
 temples, she talked much of her old age.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She often fainted. One day she even spat blood, and, as Charles fussed
 around her showing his anxiety?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bah!" she answered, "what does it matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles fled to his study and wept there, both his elbows on the table,
 sitting in an arm-chair at his bureau under the phrenological head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he wrote to his mother begging her to come, and they had many long
 consultations together on the subject of Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What should they decide? What was to be done since she rejected all
 medical treatment? "Do you know what your wife wants?" replied Madame
 Bovary senior.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work. If she
 were obliged, like so many others, to earn her living, she wouldn't have
 these vapours, that come to her from a lot of ideas she stuffs into her
 head, and from the idleness in which she lives."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet she is always busy," said Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works against
 religion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches taken from
 Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child. Anyone who has
 no religion always ends by turning out badly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So it was decided to stop Emma reading novels. The enterprise did not seem
 easy. The good lady undertook it. She was, when she passed through Rouen,
 to go herself to the lending-library and represent that Emma had
 discontinued her subscription. Would they not have a right to apply to the
 police if the librarian persisted all the same in his poisonous trade? The
 farewells of mother and daughter-in-law were cold. During the three weeks
 that they had been together they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words
 apart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at table and in the
 evening before going to bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary left on a Wednesday, the market-day at Yonville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Place since morning had been blocked by a row of carts, which, on end
 and their shafts in the air, spread all along the line of houses from the
 church to the inn. On the other side there were canvas booths, where
 cotton checks, blankets, and woollen stockings were sold, together with
 harness for horses, and packets of blue ribbon, whose ends fluttered in
 the wind. The coarse hardware was spread out on the ground between
 pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw stuck
 out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Near the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through the bars
 of flat cages. The people, crowding in the same place and unwilling to
 move thence, sometimes threatened to smash the shop front of the chemist.
 On Wednesdays his shop was never empty, and the people pushed in less to
 buy drugs than for consultations. So great was Homais' reputation in the
 neighbouring villages. His robust aplomb had fascinated the rustics. They
 considered him a greater doctor than all the doctors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was leaning out at the window; she was often there. The window in the
 provinces replaces the theatre and the promenade, she was amusing herself
 with watching the crowd of boors when she saw a gentleman in a green
 velvet coat. He had on yellow gloves, although he wore heavy gaiters; he
 was coming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant walking with
 a bent head and quite a thoughtful air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can I see the doctor?" he asked Justin, who was talking on the doorsteps
 with Felicite, and, taking him for a servant of the house?"Tell him
 that Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La Huchette is here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not from territorial vanity that the new arrival added "of La
 Huchette" to his name, but to make himself the better known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 La Huchette, in fact, was an estate near Yonville, where he had just
 bought the chateau and two farms that he cultivated himself, without,
 however, troubling very much about them. He lived as a bachelor, and was
 supposed to have "at least fifteen thousand francs a year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles came into the room. Monsieur Boulanger introduced his man, who
 wanted to be bled because he felt "a tingling all over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That'll purge me," he urged as an objection to all reasoning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Bovary ordered a bandage and a basin, and asked Justin to hold it. Then
 addressing the peasant, who was already pale?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be afraid, my lad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, sir," said the other; "get on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And with an air of bravado he held out his great arm. At the prick of the
 lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the looking-glass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold the basin nearer," exclaimed Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lor!" said the peasant, "one would swear it was a little fountain
 flowing. How red my blood is! That's a good sign, isn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sometimes," answered the doctor, "one feels nothing at first, and then
 syncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution
 like this man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he was twisting between
 his fingers. A shudder of his shoulders made the chair-back creak. His hat
 fell off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought as much," said Bovary, pressing his finger on the vein.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The basin was beginning to tremble in Justin's hands; his knees shook, he
 turned pale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Emma! Emma!" called Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With one bound she came down the staircase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some vinegar," he cried. "O dear! two at once!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in his emotion he could hardly put on the compress.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is nothing," said Monsieur Boulanger quietly, taking Justin in his
 arms. He seated him on the table with his back resting against the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary began taking off his cravat. The strings of his shirt had
 got into a knot, and she was for some minutes moving her light fingers
 about the young fellow's neck. Then she poured some vinegar on her cambric
 handkerchief; she moistened his temples with little dabs, and then blew
 upon them softly. The ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope still
 lasted, and his eyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like blue
 flowers in milk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We must hide this from him," said Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary took the basin to put it under the table. With the movement
 she made in bending down, her dress (it was a summer dress with four
 flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in the skirt) spread out
 around her on the flags of the room; and as Emma stooping, staggered a
 little as she stretched out her arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stuff here and there gave with the inflections of her bust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some pieces
 of sugar when the chemist arrived. The servant had been to fetch him in
 the tumult. Seeing his pupil's eyes staring he drew a long breath; then
 going around him he looked at him from head to foot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fool!" he said, "really a little fool! A fool in four letters! A
 phlebotomy's a big affair, isn't it! And a fellow who isn't afraid of
 anything; a kind of squirrel, just as he is who climbs to vertiginous
 heights to shake down nuts. Oh, yes! you just talk to me, boast about
 yourself! Here's a fine fitness for practising pharmacy later on; for
 under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in
 order to enlighten the minds of the magistrates, and you would have to
 keep your head then, to reason, show yourself a man, or else pass for an
 imbecile."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Justin did not answer. The chemist went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who asked you to come? You are always pestering the doctor and madame. On
 Wednesday, moreover, your presence is indispensable to me. There are now
 twenty people in the shop. I left everything because of the interest I
 take in you. Come, get along! Sharp! Wait for me, and keep an eye on the
 jars."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Justin, who was rearranging his dress, had gone, they talked for a
 little while about fainting-fits. Madame Bovary had never fainted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is extraordinary for a lady," said Monsieur Boulanger; "but some
 people are very susceptible. Thus in a duel, I have seen a second lose
 consciousness at the mere sound of the loading of pistols."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For my part," said the chemist, "the sight of other people's blood
 doesn't affect me at all, but the mere thought of my own flowing would
 make me faint if I reflected upon it too much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Boulanger, however, dismissed his servant, advising him to calm
 himself, since his fancy was over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It procured me the advantage of making your acquaintance," he added, and
 he looked at Emma as he said this. Then he put three francs on the corner
 of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was soon on the other side of the river (this was his way back to La
 Huchette), and Emma saw him in the meadow, walking under the poplars,
 slackening his pace now and then as one who reflects.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is very pretty," he said to himself; "she is very pretty, this
 doctor's wife. Fine teeth, black eyes, a dainty foot, a figure like a
 Parisienne's. Where the devil does she come from? Wherever did that fat
 fellow pick her up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was thirty-four; he was of brutal temperament
 and intelligent perspicacity, having, moreover, had much to do with women,
 and knowing them well. This one had seemed pretty to him; so he was
 thinking about her and her husband.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think he is very stupid. She is tired of him, no doubt. He has dirty
 nails, and hasn't shaved for three days. While he is trotting after his
 patients, she sits there botching socks. And she gets bored! She would
 like to live in town and dance polkas every evening. Poor little woman!
 She is gaping after love like a carp after water on a kitchen-table. With
 three words of gallantry she'd adore one, I'm sure of it. She'd be tender,
 charming. Yes; but how to get rid of her afterwards?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the difficulties of love-making seen in the distance made him by
 contrast think of his mistress. She was an actress at Rouen, whom he kept;
 and when he had pondered over this image, with which, even in remembrance,
 he was satiated?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Madame Bovary," he thought, "is much prettier, especially fresher.
 Virginie is decidedly beginning to grow fat. She is so finiky about her
 pleasures; and, besides, she has a mania for prawns."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the regular
 beating of the grass striking against his boots, with a cry of the
 grasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He again saw Emma in her
 room, dressed as he had seen her, and he undressed her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I will have her," he cried, striking a blow with his stick at a clod
 in front of him. And he at once began to consider the political part of
 the enterprise. He asked himself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where shall we meet? By what means? We shall always be having the brat on
 our hands, and the servant, the neighbours, and husband, all sorts of
 worries. Pshaw! one would lose too much time over it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he resumed, "She really has eyes that pierce one's heart like a
 gimlet. And that pale complexion! I adore pale women!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the top of the Arguiel hills he had made up his mind.
 "It's only finding the opportunities. Well, I will call in now and then.
 I'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if need be. We
 shall become friends; I'll invite them to my place. By Jove!" added he,
 "there's the agricultural show coming on. She'll be there. I shall see
 her. We'll begin boldly, for that's the surest way."
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter Eight
 </h2>
 <p>
 At last it came, the famous agricultural show. On the morning of the
 solemnity all the inhabitants at their doors were chatting over the
 preparations. The pediment of the town hall had been hung with garlands of
 ivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow for the banquet; and in the
 middle of the Place, in front of the church, a kind of bombarde was to
 announce the arrival of the prefect and the names of the successful
 farmers who had obtained prizes. The National Guard of Buchy (there was
 none at Yonville) had come to join the corps of firemen, of whom Binet was
 captain. On that day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and, tightly
 buttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless that the
 whole vital portion of his person seemed to have descended into his legs,
 which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single movement. As there was
 some rivalry between the tax-collector and the colonel, both, to show off
 their talents, drilled their men separately. One saw the red epaulettes
 and the black breastplates pass and re-pass alternately; there was no end
 to it, and it constantly began again. There had never been such a display
 of pomp. Several citizens had scoured their houses the evening before;
 tri-coloured flags hung from half-open windows; all the public-houses were
 full; and in the lovely weather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and
 the coloured neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and
 relieved with the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats
 and blue smocks. The neighbouring farmers' wives, when they got off their
 horses, pulled out the long pins that fastened around them their dresses,
 turned up for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to
 save their hats, kept their handkerchiefs around them, holding one corner
 between their teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The crowd came into the main street from both ends of the village. People
 poured in from the lanes, the alleys, the houses; and from time to time
 one heard knockers banging against doors closing behind women with their
 gloves, who were going out to see the fete. What was most admired were two
 long lamp-stands covered with lanterns, that flanked a platform on which
 the authorities were to sit. Besides this there were against the four
 columns of the town hall four kinds of poles, each bearing a small
 standard of greenish cloth, embellished with inscriptions in gold letters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On one was written, "To Commerce"; on the other, "To Agriculture"; on the
 third, "To Industry"; and on the fourth, "To the Fine Arts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken that of
 Madame Lefrancois, the innkeeper. Standing on her kitchen-steps she
 muttered to herself, "What rubbish! what rubbish! With their canvas booth!
 Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent
 like a gipsy? They call all this fussing doing good to the place! Then it
 wasn't worth while sending to Neufchatel for the keeper of a cookshop! And
 for whom? For cowherds! tatterdemalions!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The druggist was passing. He had on a frock-coat, nankeen trousers, beaver
 shoes, and, for a wonder, a hat with a low crown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your servant! Excuse me, I am in a hurry." And as the fat widow asked
 where he was going?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my
 laboratory than the man's rat in his cheese."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What cheese?" asked the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing! nothing!" Homais continued. "I merely wished to convey to
 you, Madame Lefrancois, that I usually live at home like a recluse.
 To-day, however, considering the circumstances, it is necessary?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you're going down there!" she said contemptuously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am going," replied the druggist, astonished. "Am I not a member of
 the consulting commission?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mere Lefrancois looked at him for a few moments, and ended by saying with
 a smile?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's another pair of shoes! But what does agriculture matter to you? Do
 you understand anything about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly I understand it, since I am a druggist?that is to say, a
 chemist. And the object of chemistry, Madame Lefrancois, being the
 knowledge of the reciprocal and molecular action of all natural bodies, it
 follows that agriculture is comprised within its domain. And, in fact, the
 composition of the manure, the fermentation of liquids, the analyses of
 gases, and the influence of miasmata, what, I ask you, is all this, if it
 isn't chemistry, pure and simple?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady did not answer. Homais went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think that to be an agriculturist it is necessary to have tilled
 the earth or fattened fowls oneself? It is necessary rather to know the
 composition of the substances in question?the geological strata, the
 atmospheric actions, the quality of the soil, the minerals, the waters,
 the density of the different bodies, their capillarity, and what not. And
 one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to direct,
 criticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals, the diet
 of domestics. And, moreover, Madame Lefrancois, one must know botany, be
 able to distinguish between plants, you understand, which are the
 wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are unproductive and which
 nutritive, if it is well to pull them up here and re-sow them there, to
 propagate some, destroy others; in brief, one must keep pace with science
 by means of pamphlets and public papers, be always on the alert to find
 out improvements."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady never took her eyes off the "Cafe Francois" and the chemist
 went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least they
 would pay more attention to the counsels of science. Thus lately I myself
 wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over seventy-two pages, entitled,
 'Cider, its Manufacture and its Effects, together with some New
 Reflections on the Subject,' that I sent to the Agricultural Society of
 Rouen, and which even procured me the honour of being received among its
 members?Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological. Well, if my work
 had been given to the public?" But the druggist stopped, Madame
 Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just look at them!" she said. "It's past comprehension! Such a cookshop
 as that!" And with a shrug of the shoulders that stretched out over her
 breast the stitches of her knitted bodice, she pointed with both hands at
 her rival's inn, whence songs were heard issuing. "Well, it won't last
 long," she added. "It'll be over before a week."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais drew back with stupefaction. She came down three steps and
 whispered in his ear?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! you didn't know it? There is to be an execution in next week. It's
 Lheureux who is selling him out; he has killed him with bills."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a terrible catastrophe!" cried the druggist, who always found
 expressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the landlady began telling him the story that she had heard from
 Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, and although she detested
 Tellier, she blamed Lheureux. He was "a wheedler, a sneak."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There!" she said. "Look at him! he is in the market; he is bowing to
 Madame Bovary, who's got on a green bonnet. Why, she's taking Monsieur
 Boulanger's arm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame Bovary!" exclaimed Homais. "I must go at once and pay her my
 respects. Perhaps she'll be very glad to have a seat in the enclosure
 under the peristyle." And, without heeding Madame Lefrancois, who was
 calling him back to tell him more about it, the druggist walked off
 rapidly with a smile on his lips, with straight knees, bowing copiously to
 right and left, and taking up much room with the large tails of his
 frock-coat that fluttered behind him in the wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe, having caught sight of him from afar, hurried on, but Madame
 Bovary lost her breath; so he walked more slowly, and, smiling at her,
 said in a rough tone?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's only to get away from that fat fellow, you know, the druggist." She
 pressed his elbow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the meaning of that?" he asked himself. And he looked at her out
 of the corner of his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her profile was so calm that one could guess nothing from it. It stood out
 in the light from the oval of her bonnet, with pale ribbons on it like the
 leaves of weeds. Her eyes with their long curved lashes looked straight
 before her, and though wide open, they seemed slightly puckered by the
 cheek-bones, because of the blood pulsing gently under the delicate skin.
 A pink line ran along the partition between her nostrils. Her head was
 bent upon her shoulder, and the pearl tips of her white teeth were seen
 between her lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is she making fun of me?" thought Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur
 Lheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter
 into the conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a superb day! Everybody is out! The wind is east!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him, whilst at the
 slightest movement made by them he drew near, saying, "I beg your pardon!"
 and raised his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they reached the farrier's house, instead of following the road up to
 the fence, Rodolphe suddenly turned down a path, drawing with him Madame
 Bovary. He called out?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux! See you again presently."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How you got rid of him!" she said, laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," he went on, "allow oneself to be intruded upon by others? And as
 to-day I have the happiness of being with you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma blushed. He did not finish his sentence. Then he talked of the fine
 weather and of the pleasure of walking on the grass. A few daisies had
 sprung up again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here are some pretty Easter daisies," he said, "and enough of them to
 furnish oracles to all the amorous maids in the place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He added, "Shall I pick some? What do you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you in love?" she asked, coughing a little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "H'm, h'm! who knows?" answered Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with their great
 umbrellas, their baskets, and their babies. One had often to get out of
 the way of a long file of country folk, servant-maids with blue stockings,
 flat shoes, silver rings, and who smelt of milk, when one passed close to
 them. They walked along holding one another by the hand, and thus they
 spread over the whole field from the row of open trees to the banquet
 tent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the other
 entered a kind of enclosure formed by a long cord supported on sticks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a confused
 line with their unequal rumps. Drowsy pigs were burrowing in the earth
 with their snouts, calves were bleating, lambs baaing; the cows, on knees
 folded in, were stretching their bellies on the grass, slowly chewing the
 cud, and blinking their heavy eyelids at the gnats that buzzed round them.
 Plough-men with bare arms were holding by the halter prancing stallions
 that neighed with dilated nostrils looking towards the mares. These stood
 quietly, stretching out their heads and flowing manes, while their foals
 rested in their shadow, or now and then came and sucked them. And above
 the long undulation of these crowded animals one saw some white mane
 rising in the wind like a wave, or some sharp horns sticking out, and the
 heads of men running about. Apart, outside the enclosure, a hundred paces
 off, was a large black bull, muzzled, with an iron ring in its nostrils,
 and who moved no more than if he had been in bronze. A child in rags was
 holding him by a rope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Between the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy steps,
 examining each animal, then consulting one another in a low voice. One who
 seemed of more importance now and then took notes in a book as he walked
 along. This was the president of the jury, Monsieur Derozerays de la
 Panville. As soon as he recognised Rodolphe he came forward quickly, and
 smiling amiably, said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What! Monsieur Boulanger, you are deserting us?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe protested that he was just coming. But when the president had
 disappeared?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ma foi!*" said he, "I shall not go. Your company is better than his."
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Upon my word!
</pre>
 <p>
 And while poking fun at the show, Rodolphe, to move about more easily,
 showed the gendarme his blue card, and even stopped now and then in front
 of some fine beast, which Madame Bovary did not at all admire. He noticed
 this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their dresses; then he
 apologised for the negligence of his own. He had that incongruity of
 common and elegant in which the habitually vulgar think they see the
 revelation of an eccentric existence, of the perturbations of sentiment,
 the tyrannies of art, and always a certain contempt for social
 conventions, that seduces or exasperates them. Thus his cambric shirt with
 plaited cuffs was blown out by the wind in the opening of his waistcoat of
 grey ticking, and his broad-striped trousers disclosed at the ankle
 nankeen boots with patent leather gaiters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These were so polished that they reflected the grass. He trampled on
 horses's dung with them, one hand in the pocket of his jacket and his
 straw hat on one side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides," added he, "when one lives in the country?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's waste of time," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true," replied Rodolphe. "To think that not one of these people
 is capable of understanding even the cut of a coat!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it crushed, the
 illusions lost there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I too," said Rodolphe, "am drifting into depression."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You!" she said in astonishment; "I thought you very light-hearted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! yes. I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how to wear
 the mask of a scoffer upon my face; and yet, how many a time at the sight
 of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked myself whether it were not
 better to join those sleeping there!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! and your friends?" she said. "You do not think of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My friends! What friends? Have I any? Who cares for me?" And he
 accompanied the last words with a kind of whistling of the lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they were obliged to separate from each other because of a great pile
 of chairs that a man was carrying behind them. He was so overladen with
 them that one could only see the tips of his wooden shoes and the ends of
 his two outstretched arms. It was Lestiboudois, the gravedigger, who was
 carrying the church chairs about amongst the people. Alive to all that
 concerned his interests, he had hit upon this means of turning the show to
 account; and his idea was succeeding, for he no longer knew which way to
 turn. In fact, the villagers, who were hot, quarreled for these seats,
 whose straw smelt of incense, and they leant against the thick backs,
 stained with the wax of candles, with a certain veneration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary again took Rodolphe's arm; he went on as if speaking to
 himself?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I have missed so many things. Always alone! Ah! if I had some aim in
 life, if I had met some love, if I had found someone! Oh, how I would have
 spent all the energy of which I am capable, surmounted everything,
 overcome everything!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet it seems to me," said Emma, "that you are not to be pitied."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you think so?" said Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For, after all," she went on, "you are free?" she hesitated, "rich?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not mock me," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report of a
 cannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another pell-mell
 towards the village.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and the members
 of the jury felt much embarrassed, not knowing if they ought to begin the
 meeting or still wait.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared, drawn by
 two thin horses, which a coachman in a white hat was whipping lustily.
 Binet had only just time to shout, "Present arms!" and the colonel to
 imitate him. All ran towards the enclosure; everyone pushed forward. A few
 even forgot their collars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed to
 anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their harness,
 came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town hall at the
 very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed, beating drums
 and marking time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Present!" shouted Binet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halt!" shouted the colonel. "Left about, march."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band, letting
 loose, rang out like a brass kettle rolling downstairs, all the guns were
 lowered. Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman in a
 short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft of
 hair at the back of his head, of a sallow complexion and the most benign
 appearance. His eyes, very large and covered by heavy lids, were
 half-closed to look at the crowd, while at the same time he raised his
 sharp nose, and forced a smile upon his sunken mouth. He recognised the
 mayor by his scarf, and explained to him that the prefect was not able to
 come. He himself was a councillor at the prefecture; then he added a few
 apologies. Monsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the other
 confessed himself nervous; and they remained thus, face to face, their
 foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round, the
 municipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and the
 crowd. The councillor pressing his little cocked hat to his breast
 repeated his bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled, stammered,
 tried to say something, protested his devotion to the monarchy and the
 honour that was being done to Yonville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hippolyte, the groom from the inn, took the head of the horses from the
 coachman, and, limping along with his club-foot, led them to the door of
 the "Lion d'Or", where a number of peasants collected to look at the
 carriage. The drum beat, the howitzer thundered, and the gentlemen one by
 one mounted the platform, where they sat down in red utrecht velvet
 arm-chairs that had been lent by Madame Tuvache.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All these people looked alike. Their fair flabby faces, somewhat tanned by
 the sun, were the colour of sweet cider, and their puffy whiskers emerged
 from stiff collars, kept up by white cravats with broad bows. All the
 waist-coats were of velvet, double-breasted; all the watches had, at the
 end of a long ribbon, an oval cornelian seal; everyone rested his two
 hands on his thighs, carefully stretching the stride of their trousers,
 whose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than the leather of
 their heavy boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule between
 the pillars while the common herd was opposite, standing up or sitting on
 chairs. As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither all those
 that he had moved from the field, and he even kept running back every
 minute to fetch others from the church. He caused such confusion with this
 piece of business that one had great difficulty in getting to the small
 steps of the platform.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think," said Monsieur Lheureux to the chemist, who was passing to his
 place, "that they ought to have put up two Venetian masts with something
 rather severe and rich for ornaments; it would have been a very pretty
 effect."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To be sure," replied Homais; "but what can you expect? The mayor took
 everything on his own shoulders. He hasn't much taste. Poor Tuvache! and
 he is even completely destitute of what is called the genius of art."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first floor of
 the town hall, to the "council-room," and, as it was empty, he declared
 that they could enjoy the sight there more comfortably. He fetched three
 stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch, and having
 carried them to one of the windows, they sat down by each other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying. At
 last the councillor got up. They knew now that his name was Lieuvain, and
 in the crowd the name was passed from one to the other. After he had
 collated a few pages, and bent over them to see better, he began?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing you on the
 object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will, I am sure, be
 shared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to pay a tribute to the
 higher administration, to the government to the monarch, gentle men, our
 sovereign, to that beloved king, to whom no branch of public or private
 prosperity is a matter of indifference, and who directs with a hand at
 once so firm and wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils
 of a stormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as well as
 war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ought," said Rodolphe, "to get back a little further."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an extraordinary
 pitch. He declaimed?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord ensanguined our
 public places, when the landlord, the business-man, the working-man
 himself, falling asleep at night, lying down to peaceful sleep, trembled
 lest he should be awakened suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins,
 when the most subversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, someone down there might see me," Rodolphe resumed, "then I should
 have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad reputation?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you are slandering yourself," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! It is dreadful, I assure you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, gentlemen," continued the councillor, "if, banishing from my memory
 the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes back to the actual
 situation of our dear country, what do I see there? Everywhere commerce
 and the arts are flourishing; everywhere new means of communication, like
 so many new arteries in the body of the state, establish within it new
 relations. Our great industrial centres have recovered all their activity;
 religion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are full,
 confidence is born again, and France breathes once more!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides," added Rodolphe, "perhaps from the world's point of view they
 are right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How so?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" said he. "Do you not know that there are souls constantly
 tormented? They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest passions and
 the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling themselves into all sorts of
 fantasies, of follies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over
 strange lands, and went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have not even this distraction, we poor women!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A sad distraction, for happiness isn't found in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But is it ever found?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; one day it comes," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And this is what you have understood," said the councillor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work that
 belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress and morality, you
 have understood, I say, that political storms are even more redoubtable
 than atmospheric disturbances!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It comes one day," repeated Rodolphe, "one day suddenly, and when one is
 despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as if a voice cried, 'It
 is here!' You feel the need of confiding the whole of your life, of giving
 everything, sacrificing everything to this being. There is no need for
 explanations; they understand one another. They have seen each other in
 dreams!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 (And he looked at her.) "In fine, here it is, this treasure so sought
 after, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one still doubts, one
 does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if one went out iron darkness
 into light."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed his hand
 over his face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he let it fall on
 Emma's. She took hers away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen? He only who is so blind, so
 plunged (I do not fear to say it), so plunged in the prejudices of another
 age as still to misunderstand the spirit of agricultural populations.
 Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the country, greater
 devotion to the public welfare, more intelligence, in a word? And,
 gentlemen, I do not mean that superficial intelligence, vain ornament of
 idle minds, but rather that profound and balanced intelligence that
 applies itself above all else to useful objects, thus contributing to the
 good of all, to the common amelioration and to the support of the state,
 born of respect for law and the practice of duty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! again!" said Rodolphe. "Always 'duty.' I am sick of the word. They
 are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of old women with
 foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone into our ears 'Duty, duty!'
 Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel what is great, cherish the beautiful,
 and not accept all the conventions of society with the ignominy that it
 imposes upon us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet?yet?" objected Madame Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no! Why cry out against the passions? Are they not the one beautiful
 thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of enthusiasm, of poetry,
 music, the arts, of everything, in a word?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But one must," said Emma, "to some extent bow to the opinion of the world
 and accept its moral code."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! but there are two," he replied. "The small, the conventional, that of
 men, that which constantly changes, that brays out so loudly, that makes
 such a commotion here below, of the earth earthly, like the mass of
 imbeciles you see down there. But the other, the eternal, that is about us
 and above, like the landscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that
 give us light."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a pocket-handkerchief. He
 continued?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the uses of
 agriculture? Who supplies our wants? Who provides our means of
 subsistence? Is it not the agriculturist? The agriculturist, gentlemen,
 who, sowing with laborious hand the fertile furrows of the country, brings
 forth the corn, which, being ground, is made into a powder by means of
 ingenious machinery, comes out thence under the name of flour, and from
 there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the baker's, who
 makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again, is it not the
 agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his abundant flocks in the
 pastures? For how should we clothe ourselves, how nourish ourselves,
 without the agriculturist? And, gentlemen, is it even necessary to go so
 far for examples? Who has not frequently reflected on all the momentous
 things that we get out of that modest animal, the ornament of
 poultry-yards, that provides us at once with a soft pillow for our bed,
 with succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs? But I should never end if I
 were to enumerate one after the other all the different products which the
 earth, well cultivated, like a generous mother, lavishes upon her
 children. Here it is the vine, elsewhere the apple tree for cider, there
 colza, farther on cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let us not forget flax,
 which has made such great strides of late years, and to which I will more
 particularly call your attention."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude were wide
 open, as if to drink in his words. Tuvache by his side listened to him
 with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time to time softly closed his
 eyelids, and farther on the chemist, with his son Napoleon between his
 knees, put his hand behind his ear in order not to lose a syllable. The
 chins of the other members of the jury went slowly up and down in their
 waistcoats in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the platform
 rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with out-turned
 elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps he could hear, but
 certainly he could see nothing, because of the visor of his helmet, that
 fell down on his nose. His lieutenant, the youngest son of Monsieur
 Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his was enormous, and shook on his head,
 and from it an end of his cotton scarf peeped out. He smiled beneath it
 with a perfectly infantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence
 drops were running, wore an expression of enjoyment and sleepiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw folk
 leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing at doors, and
 Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed quite transfixed by the
 sight of what he was looking at. In spite of the silence Monsieur
 Lieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It reached you in fragments of
 phrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the
 crowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the
 bleating of the lambs, who answered one another at street corners. In
 fact, the cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and
 these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore down
 some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low voice,
 speaking rapidly?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you? Is there a single
 sentiment it does not condemn? The noblest instincts, the purest
 sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two poor souls do
 meet, all is so organised that they cannot blend together. Yet they will
 make the attempt; they will flutter their wings; they will call upon each
 other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or later, in six months, ten years, they will
 come together, will love; for fate has decreed it, and they are born one
 for the other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face towards
 Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her. She noticed in his eyes
 small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she even smelt the perfume
 of the pomade that made his hair glossy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had waltzed
 with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this air an odour of
 vanilla and citron, and mechanically she half-closed her eyes the better
 to breathe it in. But in making this movement, as she leant back in her
 chair, she saw in the distance, right on the line of the horizon, the old
 diligence, the "Hirondelle," that was slowly descending the hill of Leux,
 dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this yellow carriage
 that Leon had so often come back to her, and by this route down there that
 he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw him opposite at his windows;
 then all grew confused; clouds gathered; it seemed to her that she was
 again turning in the waltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of
 the Viscount, and that Leon was not far away, that he was coming; and yet
 all the time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe's head by her
 side. This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old desires, and
 these, like grains of sand under a gust of wind, eddied to and fro in the
 subtle breath of the perfume which suffused her soul. She opened wide her
 nostrils several times to drink in the freshness of the ivy round the
 capitals. She took off her gloves, she wiped her hands, then fanned her
 face with her handkerchief, while athwart the throbbing of her temples she
 heard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the councillor intoning his
 phrases. He said?"Continue, persevere; listen neither to the
 suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty councils of a rash
 empiricism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to good
 manures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine, and porcine
 races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas, where the victor in
 leaving it will hold forth a hand to the vanquished, and will fraternise
 with him in the hope of better success. And you, aged servants, humble
 domestics, whose hard labour no Government up to this day has taken into
 consideration, come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues,
 and be assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it
 encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just demands,
 and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your painful
 sacrifices."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up, beginning
 another speech. His was not perhaps so florid as that of the councillor,
 but it recommended itself by a more direct style, that is to say, by more
 special knowledge and more elevated considerations. Thus the praise of the
 Government took up less space in it; religion and agriculture more. He
 showed in it the relations of these two, and how they had always
 contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was talking
 dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of society, the
 orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns in the heart of
 woods. Then they had left off the skins of beasts, had put on cloth,
 tilled the soil, planted the vine. Was this a good, and in this discovery
 was there not more of injury than of gain? Monsieur Derozerays set himself
 this problem. From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to
 affinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and his plough,
 Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the Emperors of China inaugurating
 the year by the sowing of seed, the young man was explaining to the young
 woman that these irresistible attractions find their cause in some
 previous state of existence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thus we," he said, "why did we come to know one another? What chance
 willed it? It was because across the infinite, like two streams that flow
 but to unite; our special bents of mind had driven us towards each other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For good farming generally!" cried the president.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just now, for example, when I went to your house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did I know I should accompany you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seventy francs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you?I remained."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manures!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my life!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For I have never in the society of any other person found so complete a
 charm."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For a merino ram!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life, shall I not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Porcine race; prizes?equal, to Messrs. Leherisse and Cullembourg,
 sixty francs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and quivering like
 a captive dove that wants to fly away; but, whether she was trying to take
 it away or whether she was answering his pressure; she made a movement
 with her fingers. He exclaimed?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You understand that
 I am yours! Let me look at you; let me contemplate you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the table,
 and in the square below all the great caps of the peasant women were
 uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Use of oil-cakes," continued the president. He was hurrying on: "Flemish
 manure-flax-growing-drainage-long leases-domestic service."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A supreme
 desire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without an effort, their
 fingers intertwined.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerriere, for
 fifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver medal?value,
 twenty-five francs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is Catherine Leroux?" repeated the councillor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not present herself, and one could hear voices whispering?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go up!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be afraid!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, how stupid she is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, is she there?" cried Tuvache.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; here she is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then let her come up!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid
 bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On her feet she
 wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a large blue apron. Her
 pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered
 russet apple. And from the sleeves of her red jacket looked out two large
 hands with knotty joints, the dust of barns, the potash of washing the
 grease of wools had so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they
 seemed dirty, although they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of
 long service they remained half open, as if to bear humble witness for
 themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic rigidity
 dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion weakened that pale
 look. In her constant living with animals she had caught their dumbness
 and their calm. It was the first time that she found herself in the midst
 of so large a company, and inwardly scared by the flags, the drums, the
 gentlemen in frock-coats, and the order of the councillor, she stood
 motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run away, nor why the crowd
 was pushing her and the jury were smiling at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of servitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!" said the
 councillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the president;
 and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman by turns, he repeated
 in a fatherly tone?"Approach! approach!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you deaf?" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he began
 shouting in her ear, "Fifty-four years of service. A silver medal!
 Twenty-five francs! For you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of beatitude
 spread over her face; and as she walked away they could hear her muttering
 "I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some masses for me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What fanaticism!" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the notary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had
 been read, each one fell back into his place again, and everything into
 the old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck the
 animals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on
 their horns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of the town
 hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the drummer of the battalion
 carried a basket with bottles. Madame Bovary took Rodolphe's arm; he saw
 her home; they separated at her door; then he walked about alone in the
 meadow while he waited for the time of the banquet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that
 they could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks used for forms
 almost broke down under their weight. They ate hugely. Each one stuffed
 himself on his own account. Sweat stood on every brow, and a whitish
 steam, like the vapour of a stream on an autumn morning, floated above the
 table between the hanging lamps. Rodolphe, leaning against the calico of
 the tent was thinking so earnestly of Emma that he heard nothing. Behind
 him on the grass the servants were piling up the dirty plates, his
 neighbours were talking; he did not answer them; they filled his glass,
 and there was silence in his thoughts in spite of the growing noise. He
 was dreaming of what she had said, of the line of her lips; her face, as
 in a magic mirror, shone on the plates of the shakos, the folds of her
 gown fell along the walls, and days of love unrolled to all infinity
 before him in the vistas of the future.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw her again in the evening during the fireworks, but she was with her
 husband, Madame Homais, and the druggist, who was worrying about the
 danger of stray rockets, and every moment he left the company to go and
 give some advice to Binet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an excess of
 caution, been shut up in his cellar, and so the damp powder would not
 light, and the principal set piece, that was to represent a dragon biting
 his tail, failed completely. Now and then a meagre Roman-candle went off;
 then the gaping crowd sent up a shout that mingled with the cry of the
 women, whose waists were being squeezed in the darkness. Emma silently
 nestled against Charles's shoulder; then, raising her chin, she watched
 the luminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe gazed at
 her in the light of the burning lanterns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went out one by one. The stars shone out. A few crops of rain began
 to fall. She knotted her fichu round her bare head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this moment the councillor's carriage came out from the inn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off, and one could see from
 the distance, above the hood, between the two lanterns, the mass of his
 body, that swayed from right to left with the giving of the traces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Truly," said the druggist, "one ought to proceed most rigorously against
 drunkenness! I should like to see written up weekly at the door of the
 town hall on a board ad hoc* the names of all those who during the week
 got intoxicated on alcohol. Besides, with regard to statistics, one would
 thus have, as it were, public records that one could refer to in case of
 need. But excuse me!"
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Specifically for that.
</pre>
 <p>
 And he once more ran off to the captain. The latter was going back to see
 his lathe again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps you would not do ill," Homais said to him, "to send one of your
 men, or to go yourself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave me alone!" answered the tax-collector. "It's all right!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not be uneasy," said the druggist, when he returned to his friends.
 "Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have been taken. No
 sparks have fallen; the pumps are full. Let us go to rest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ma foi! I want it," said Madame Homais, yawning at large. "But never
 mind; we've had a beautiful day for our fete."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, "Oh, yes! very
 beautiful!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And having bowed to one another, they separated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two days later, in the "Final de Rouen," there was a long article on the
 show. Homais had composed it with verve the very next morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why these festoons, these flowers, these garlands? Whither hurries this
 crowd like the waves of a furious sea under the torrents of a tropical sun
 pouring its heat upon our heads?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he spoke of the condition of the peasants. Certainly the Government
 was doing much, but not enough. "Courage!" he cried to it; "a thousand
 reforms are indispensable; let us accomplish them!" Then touching on the
 entry of the councillor, he did not forget "the martial air of our
 militia;" nor "our most merry village maidens;" nor the "bald-headed old
 men like patriarchs who were there, and of whom some, the remnants of our
 phalanxes, still felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the drums."
 He cited himself among the first of the members of the jury, and he even
 called attention in a note to the fact that Monsieur Homais, chemist, had
 sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came to the distribution of the prizes, he painted the joy of the
 prize-winners in dithyrambic strophes. "The father embraced the son, the
 brother the brother, the husband his consort. More than one showed his
 humble medal with pride; and no doubt when he got home to his good
 housewife, he hung it up weeping on the modest walls of his cot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About six o'clock a banquet prepared in the meadow of Monsieur Leigeard
 brought together the principal personages of the fete. The greatest
 cordiality reigned here. Divers toasts were proposed: Monsieur Lieuvain,
 the King; Monsieur Tuvache, the Prefect; Monsieur Derozerays, Agriculture;
 Monsieur Homais, Industry and the Fine Arts, those twin sisters; Monsieur
 Leplichey, Progress. In the evening some brilliant fireworks on a sudden
 illumined the air. One would have called it a veritable kaleidoscope, a
 real operatic scene; and for a moment our little locality might have
 thought itself transported into the midst of a dream of the 'Thousand and
 One Nights.' Let us state that no untoward event disturbed this family
 meeting." And he added "Only the absence of the clergy was remarked. No
 doubt the priests understand progress in another fashion. Just as you
 please, messieurs the followers of Loyola!"

 <h2>
 Chapter Nine
 </h2>
 <p>
 Six weeks passed. Rodolphe did not come again. At last one evening he
 appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The day after the show he had said to himself?"We mustn't go back
 too soon; that would be a mistake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And at the end of a week he had gone off hunting. After the hunting he had
 thought it was too late, and then he reasoned thus?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If from the first day she loved me, she must from impatience to see me
 again love me more. Let's go on with it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he knew that his calculation had been right when, on entering the
 room, he saw Emma turn pale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was alone. The day was drawing in. The small muslin curtain along the
 windows deepened the twilight, and the gilding of the barometer, on which
 the rays of the sun fell, shone in the looking-glass between the meshes of
 the coral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe remained standing, and Emma hardly answered his first
 conventional phrases.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I," he said, "have been busy. I have been ill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seriously?" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Rodolphe, sitting down at her side on a footstool, "no; it
 was because I did not want to come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you not guess?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head, blushing.
 He went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Emma!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir," she said, drawing back a little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you see," replied he in a melancholy voice, "that I was right not to
 come back; for this name, this name that fills my whole soul, and that
 escaped me, you forbid me to use! Madame Bovary! why all the world calls
 you thus! Besides, it is not your name; it is the name of another!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He repeated, "of another!" And he hid his face in his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I think of you constantly. The memory of you drives me to despair.
 Ah! forgive me! I will leave you! Farewell! I will go far away, so far
 that you will never hear of me again; and yet?to-day?I know
 not what force impelled me towards you. For one does not struggle against
 Heaven; one cannot resist the smile of angels; one is carried away by that
 which is beautiful, charming, adorable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the first time that Emma had heard such words spoken to herself,
 and her pride, like one who reposes bathed in warmth, expanded softly and
 fully at this glowing language.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But if I did not come," he continued, "if I could not see you, at least I
 have gazed long on all that surrounds you. At night-every night-I arose; I
 came hither; I watched your house, its glimmering in the moon, the trees
 in the garden swaying before your window, and the little lamp, a gleam
 shining through the window-panes in the darkness. Ah! you never knew that
 there, so near you, so far from you, was a poor wretch!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned towards him with a sob.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you are good!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I love you, that is all! You do not doubt that! Tell me?one
 word?only one word!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the ground; but a
 sound of wooden shoes was heard in the kitchen, and he noticed the door of
 the room was not closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How kind it would be of you," he went on, rising, "if you would humour a
 whim of mine." It was to go over her house; he wanted to know it; and
 Madame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both rose, when Charles
 came in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good morning, doctor," Rodolphe said to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor, flattered at this unexpected title, launched out into
 obsequious phrases. Of this the other took advantage to pull himself
 together a little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame was speaking to me," he then said, "about her health."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles interrupted him; he had indeed a thousand anxieties; his wife's
 palpitations of the heart were beginning again. Then Rodolphe asked if
 riding would not be good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly! excellent! just the thing! There's an idea! You ought to
 follow it up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered one.
 She refused his offer; he did not insist. Then to explain his visit he
 said that his ploughman, the man of the blood-letting, still suffered from
 giddiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll call around," said Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no! I'll send him to you; we'll come; that will be more convenient
 for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! very good! I thank you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as soon as they were alone, "Why don't you accept Monsieur Boulanger's
 kind offer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally declared
 that perhaps it would look odd.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what the deuce do I care for that?" said Charles, making a
 pirouette. "Health before everything! You are wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must order one," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The riding-habit decided her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger that his
 wife was at his command, and that they counted on his good-nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day at noon Rodolphe appeared at Charles's door with two
 saddle-horses. One had pink rosettes at his ears and a deerskin
 side-saddle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she
 had never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was charmed with his
 appearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat and white
 corduroy breeches. She was ready; she was waiting for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Justin escaped from the chemist's to see her start, and the chemist also
 came out. He was giving Monsieur Boulanger a little good advice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "An accident happens so easily. Be careful! Your horses perhaps are
 mettlesome."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She heard a noise above her; it was Felicite drumming on the windowpanes
 to amuse little Berthe. The child blew her a kiss; her mother answered
 with a wave of her whip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A pleasant ride!" cried Monsieur Homais. "Prudence! above all, prudence!"
 And he flourished his newspaper as he saw them disappear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as he felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe galloped by her side. Now and then they exchanged a word. Her
 figure slightly bent, her hand well up, and her right arm stretched out,
 she gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in her
 saddle. At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head; they
 started together at a bound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped,
 and her large blue veil fell about her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds hovered
 on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others, rent asunder,
 floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a rift in the clouds,
 beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with
 the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and the church
 steeple. Emma half closed her eyes to pick out her house, and never had
 this poor village where she lived appeared so small. From the height on
 which they were the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off
 its vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there stood out like
 black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose above the mist
 were like a beach stirred by the wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light shimmered in the
 warm atmosphere. The earth, ruddy like the powder of tobacco, deadened the
 noise of their steps, and with the edge of their shoes the horses as they
 walked kicked the fallen fir cones in front of them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She turned away
 from time to time to avoid his look, and then she saw only the pine trunks
 in lines, whose monotonous succession made her a little giddy. The horses
 were panting; the leather of the saddles creaked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God protects us!" said Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think so?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forward! forward!" he continued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He "tchk'd" with his tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Long ferns by the roadside caught in Emma's stirrup.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At other
 times, to turn aside the branches, he passed close to her, and Emma felt
 his knee brushing against her leg. The sky was now blue, the leaves no
 longer stirred. There were spaces full of heather in flower, and plots of
 violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were grey,
 fawn, or golden coloured, according to the nature of their leaves. Often
 in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the hoarse, soft
 cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She walked on in front
 on the moss between the paths. But her long habit got in her way, although
 she held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe, walking behind her, saw between
 the black cloth and the black shoe the fineness of her white stocking,
 that seemed to him as if it were a part of her nakedness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stopped. "I am tired," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, try again," he went on. "Courage!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then some hundred paces farther on she again stopped, and through her
 veil, that fell sideways from her man's hat over her hips, her face
 appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were floating under azure
 waves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where are we going?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not answer. She was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked round
 him biting his moustache. They came to a larger space where the coppice
 had been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and Rodolphe
 began speaking to her of his love. He did not begin by frightening her
 with compliments. He was calm, serious, melancholy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma listened to him with bowed head, and stirred the bits of wood on the
 ground with the tip of her foot. But at the words, "Are not our destinies
 now one?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no!" she replied. "You know that well. It is impossible!" She rose to
 go. He seized her by the wrist. She stopped. Then, having gazed at him for
 a few moments with an amorous and humid look, she said hurriedly?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses? Let us go back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She repeated:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where are the horses? Where are the horses?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then smiling a strange smile, his pupil fixed, his teeth set, he advanced
 with outstretched arms. She recoiled trembling. She stammered:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it must be," he went on, his face changing; and he again became
 respectful, caressing, timid. She gave him her arm. They went back. He
 said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was the matter with you? Why? I do not understand. You were
 mistaken, no doubt. In my soul you are as a Madonna on a pedestal, in a
 place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to live! I must have your
 eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my friend, my sister, my angel!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he put out his arm round her waist. She feebly tried to disengage
 herself. He supported her thus as they walked along.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! one moment!" said Rodolphe. "Do not let us go! Stay!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a greenness on
 the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between the reeds. At the
 noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped away to hide themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am wrong! I am wrong!" she said. "I am mad to listen to you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why? Emma! Emma!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Rodolphe!" said the young woman slowly, leaning on his shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She threw
 back her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering, in tears, with a
 long shudder and hiding her face, she gave herself up to him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing between the
 branches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her, in the leaves or on
 the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it hummingbirds flying about had
 scattered their feathers. Silence was everywhere; something sweet seemed
 to come forth from the trees; she felt her heart, whose beating had begun
 again, and the blood coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk.
 Then far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague
 prolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard it
 mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing nerves.
 Rodolphe, a cigar between his lips, was mending with his penknife one of
 the two broken bridles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw again the
 traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets, the same stones to
 the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and yet for her something
 had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their
 places. Rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her hand to kiss it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was charming on horseback?upright, with her slender waist, her
 knee bent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed by the fresh
 air in the red of the evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road. People looked
 at her from the windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At dinner her husband thought she looked well, but she pretended not to
 hear him when he inquired about her ride, and she remained sitting there
 with her elbow at the side of her plate between the two lighted candles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Emma!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. He has an old cob,
 still very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be bought; I
 am sure, for a hundred crowns." He added, "And thinking it might please
 you, I have bespoken it?bought it. Have I done right? Do tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She nodded her head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you going out to-night?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut herself up in
 her room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches,
 Rodolphe, and she again felt the pressure of his arm, while the leaves
 rustled and the reeds whistled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face. Never had
 her eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a depth. Something subtle
 about her being transfigured her. She repeated, "I have a lover! a lover!"
 delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her. So at last
 she was to know those joys of love, that fever of happiness of which she
 had despaired! She was entering upon marvels where all would be passion,
 ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed her, the heights of
 sentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary existence appeared only
 afar off, down below in the shade, through the interspaces of these
 heights.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read, and the
 lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her memory with
 the voice of sisters that charmed her. She became herself, as it were, an
 actual part of these imaginings, and realised the love-dream of her youth
 as she saw herself in this type of amorous women whom she had so envied.
 Besides, Emma felt a satisfaction of revenge. Had she not suffered enough?
 But now she triumphed, and the love so long pent up burst forth in full
 joyous bubblings. She tasted it without remorse, without anxiety, without
 trouble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows to one
 another She told him of her sorrows. Rodolphe interrupted her with kisses;
 and she looking at him through half-closed eyes, asked him to call her
 again by her name?to say that he loved her They were in the forest,
 as yesterday, in the shed of some woodenshoe maker. The walls were of
 straw, and the roof so low they had to stoop. They were seated side by
 side on a bed of dry leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every evening.
 Emma placed her letter at the end of the garden, by the river, in a
 fissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there,
 that she always found fault with as too short.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she was seized
 with the fancy to see Rodolphe at once. She would go quickly to La
 Huchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at Yonville while everyone
 was still asleep. This idea made her pant with desire, and she soon found
 herself in the middle of the field, walking with rapid steps, without
 looking behind her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Day was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her lover's house. Its
 two dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against the pale dawn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Beyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she thought must be
 the chateau She entered?it was if the doors at her approach had
 opened wide of their own accord. A large straight staircase led up to the
 corridor. Emma raised the latch of a door, and suddenly at the end of the
 room she saw a man sleeping. It was Rodolphe. She uttered a cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You here? You here?" he repeated. "How did you manage to come? Ah! your
 dress is damp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I love you," she answered, throwing her arms about his neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles went out
 early Emma dressed quickly and slipped on tiptoe down the steps that led
 to the waterside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when the plank for the cows was taken up, she had to go by the walls
 alongside of the river; the bank was slippery; in order not to fall she
 caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers. Then she went across
 ploughed fields, in which she sank, stumbling; and clogging her thin
 shoes. Her scarf, knotted round her head, fluttered to the wind in the
 meadows. She was afraid of the oxen; she began to run; she arrived out of
 breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing out from her whole person a fresh
 perfume of sap, of verdure, of the open air. At this hour Rodolphe still
 slept. It was like a spring morning coming into his room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light enter
 softly. Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops of
 dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around her
 face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her to him, and pressed her to his breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables, combed
 her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his shaving-glass. Often
 she even put between her teeth the big pipe that lay on the table by the
 bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a bottle of water.

 <p>
 It took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then Emma cried.
 She would have wished never to leave Rodolphe. Something stronger than
 herself forced her to him; so much so, that one day, seeing her come
 unexpectedly, he frowned as one put out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter with you?" she said. "Are you ill? Tell me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last he declared with a serious air that her visits were becoming
 imprudent?that she was compromising herself.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter Ten
 </h2>
 <p>
 Gradually Rodolphe's fears took possession of her. At first, love had
 intoxicated her; and she had thought of nothing beyond. But now that he
 was indispensable to her life, she feared to lose anything of this, or
 even that it should be disturbed. When she came back from his house she
 looked all about her, anxiously watching every form that passed in the
 horizon, and every village window from which she could be seen. She
 listened for steps, cries, the noise of the ploughs, and she stopped
 short, white, and trembling more than the aspen leaves swaying overhead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she saw the
 long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her. It stuck out
 sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on the edge
 of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked on, and a
 man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box. He had gaiters buckled
 up to the knees, his cap pulled down over his eyes, trembling lips, and a
 red nose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for wild ducks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ought to have called out long ago!" he exclaimed; "When one sees a
 gun, one should always give warning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had, for a
 prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in boats, Monsieur
 Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was infringing them, and so he
 every moment expected to see the rural guard turn up. But this anxiety
 whetted his pleasure, and, all alone in his tub, he congratulated himself
 on his luck and on his cuteness. At sight of Emma he seemed relieved from
 a great weight, and at once entered upon a conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't warm; it's nipping."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma answered nothing. He went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you're out so early?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said stammering; "I am just coming from the nurse where my
 child is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you see me,
 since break of day; but the weather is so muggy, that unless one had the
 bird at the mouth of the gun?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good evening, Monsieur Binet," she interrupted him, turning on her heel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your servant, madame," he replied drily; and he went back into his tub.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No doubt he
 would form unfavourable conjectures. The story about the nurse was the
 worst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing that the little Bovary
 had been at home with her parents for a year. Besides, no one was living
 in this direction; this path led only to La Huchette. Binet, then, would
 guess whence she came, and he would not keep silence; he would talk, that
 was certain. She remained until evening racking her brain with every
 conceivable lying project, and had constantly before her eyes that
 imbecile with the game-bag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles after dinner, seeing her gloomy, proposed, by way of distraction,
 to take her to the chemist's, and the first person she caught sight of in
 the shop was the taxcollector again. He was standing in front of the
 counter, lit up by the gleams of the red bottle, and was saying?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Please give me half an ounce of vitriol."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Justin," cried the druggist, "bring us the sulphuric acid." Then to Emma,
 who was going up to Madame Homais' room, "No, stay here; it isn't worth
 while going up; she is just coming down. Warm yourself at the stove in the
 meantime. Excuse me. Good-day, doctor," (for the chemist much enjoyed
 pronouncing the word "doctor," as if addressing another by it reflected on
 himself some of the grandeur that he found in it). "Now, take care not to
 upset the mortars! You'd better fetch some chairs from the little room;
 you know very well that the arm-chairs are not to be taken out of the
 drawing-room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And to put his arm-chair back in its place he was darting away from the
 counter, when Binet asked him for half an ounce of sugar acid.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sugar acid!" said the chemist contemptuously, "don't know it; I'm
 ignorant of it! But perhaps you want oxalic acid. It is oxalic acid, isn't
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Binet explained that he wanted a corrosive to make himself some
 copperwater with which to remove rust from his hunting things.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma shuddered. The chemist began saying?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless," replied the tax-collector, with a sly look, "there are
 people who like it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was stifling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And give me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will he never go?" thought she.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow wax, and
 three half ounces of animal charcoal, if you please, to clean the
 varnished leather of my togs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais appeared,
 Irma in her arms, Napoleon by her side, and Athalie following. She sat
 down on the velvet seat by the window, and the lad squatted down on a
 footstool, while his eldest sister hovered round the jujube box near her
 papa. The latter was filling funnels and corking phials, sticking on
 labels, making up parcels. Around him all were silent; only from time to
 time, were heard the weights jingling in the balance, and a few low words
 from the chemist giving directions to his pupil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how's the little woman?" suddenly asked Madame Homais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Silence!" exclaimed her husband, who was writing down some figures in his
 waste-book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you bring her?" she went on in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush! hush!" said Emma, pointing with her finger to the druggist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Binet, quite absorbed in looking over his bill, had probably heard
 nothing. At last he went out. Then Emma, relieved, uttered a deep sigh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How hard you are breathing!" said Madame Homais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see, it's rather warm," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the next day they talked over how to arrange their rendezvous. Emma
 wanted to bribe her servant with a present, but it would be better to find
 some safe house at Yonville. Rodolphe promised to look for one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All through the winter, three or four times a week, in the dead of night
 he came to the garden. Emma had on purpose taken away the key of the gate,
 which Charles thought lost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To call her, Rodolphe threw a sprinkle of sand at the shutters. She jumped
 up with a start; but sometimes he had to wait, for Charles had a mania for
 chatting by the fireside, and he would not stop. She was wild with
 impatience; if her eyes could have done it, she would have hurled him out
 at the window. At last she would begin to undress, then take up a book,
 and go on reading very quietly as if the book amused her. But Charles, who
 was in bed, called to her to come too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, now, Emma," he said, "it is time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am coming," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, as the candles dazzled him; he turned to the wall and fell asleep.
 She escaped, smiling, palpitating, undressed. Rodolphe had a large cloak;
 he wrapped her in it, and putting his arm round her waist, he drew her
 without a word to the end of the garden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was in the arbour, on the same seat of old sticks where formerly Leon
 had looked at her so amorously on the summer evenings. She never thought
 of him now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches. Behind them they
 heard the river flowing, and now and again on the bank the rustling of the
 dry reeds. Masses of shadow here and there loomed out in the darkness, and
 sometimes, vibrating with one movement, they rose up and swayed like
 immense black waves pressing forward to engulf them. The cold of the
 nights made them clasp closer; the sighs of their lips seemed to them
 deeper; their eyes that they could hardly see, larger; and in the midst of
 the silence low words were spoken that fell on their souls sonorous,
 crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied vibrations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the night was rainy, they took refuge in the consulting-room between
 the cart-shed and the stable. She lighted one of the kitchen candles that
 she had hidden behind the books. Rodolphe settled down there as if at
 home. The sight of the library, of the bureau, of the whole apartment, in
 fine, excited his merriment, and he could not refrain from making jokes
 about Charles, which rather embarrassed Emma. She would have liked to see
 him more serious, and even on occasions more dramatic; as, for example,
 when she thought she heard a noise of approaching steps in the alley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Someone is coming!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He blew out the light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you your pistols?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, to defend yourself," replied Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "From your husband? Oh, poor devil!" And Rodolphe finished his sentence
 with a gesture that said, "I could crush him with a flip of my finger."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was wonder-stricken at his bravery, although she felt in it a sort of
 indecency and a naive coarseness that scandalised her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. If she had
 spoken seriously, it was very ridiculous, he thought, even odious; for he
 had no reason to hate the good Charles, not being what is called devoured
 by jealousy; and on this subject Emma had taken a great vow that he did
 not think in the best of taste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides, she was growing very sentimental. She had insisted on exchanging
 miniatures; they had cut off handfuls of hair, and now she was asking for
 a ring?a real wedding-ring, in sign of an eternal union. She often
 spoke to him of the evening chimes, of the voices of nature. Then she
 talked to him of her mother?hers! and of his mother?his!
 Rodolphe had lost his twenty years ago. Emma none the less consoled him
 with caressing words as one would have done a lost child, and she
 sometimes even said to him, gazing at the moon?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am sure that above there together they approve of our love."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she was so pretty. He had possessed so few women of such
 ingenuousness. This love without debauchery was a new experience for him,
 and, drawing him out of his lazy habits, caressed at once his pride and
 his sensuality. Emma's enthusiasm, which his bourgeois good sense
 disdained, seemed to him in his heart of hearts charming, since it was
 lavished on him. Then, sure of being loved, he no longer kept up
 appearances, and insensibly his ways changed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her cry, nor
 passionate caresses that made her mad, so that their great love, which
 engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath her like the water of a
 stream absorbed into its channel, and she could see the bed of it. She
 would not believe it; she redoubled in tenderness, and Rodolphe concealed
 his indifference less and less.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or whether she
 did not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him the more. The humiliation of
 feeling herself weak was turning to rancour, tempered by their voluptuous
 pleasures. It was not affection; it was like a continual seduction. He
 subjugated her; she almost feared him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Appearances, nevertheless, were calmer than ever, Rodolphe having
 succeeded in carrying out the adultery after his own fancy; and at the end
 of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to one another like a
 married couple, tranquilly keeping up a domestic flame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the time of year when old Rouault sent his turkey in remembrance of
 the setting of his leg. The present always arrived with a letter. Emma cut
 the string that tied it to the basket, and read the following lines:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My Dear Children?I hope this will find you well, and that this one
 will be as good as the others. For it seems to me a little more tender, if
 I may venture to say so, and heavier. But next time, for a change, I'll
 give you a turkeycock, unless you have a preference for some dabs; and
 send me back the hamper, if you please, with the two old ones. I have had
 an accident with my cart-sheds, whose covering flew off one windy night
 among the trees. The harvest has not been overgood either. Finally, I
 don't know when I shall come to see you. It is so difficult now to leave
 the house since I am alone, my poor Emma."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here there was a break in the lines, as if the old fellow had dropped his
 pen to dream a little while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other day at
 the fair at Yvetot, where I had gone to hire a shepherd, having turned
 away mine because he was too dainty. How we are to be pitied with such a
 lot of thieves! Besides, he was also rude. I heard from a pedlar, who,
 travelling through your part of the country this winter, had a tooth
 drawn, that Bovary was as usual working hard. That doesn't surprise me;
 and he showed me his tooth; we had some coffee together. I asked him if he
 had seen you, and he said not, but that he had seen two horses in the
 stables, from which I conclude that business is looking up. So much the
 better, my dear children, and may God send you every imaginable happiness!
 It grieves me not yet to have seen my dear little grand-daughter, Berthe
 Bovary. I have planted an Orleans plum-tree for her in the garden under
 your room, and I won't have it touched unless it is to have jam made for
 her by and bye, that I will keep in the cupboard for her when she comes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, my dear children. I kiss you, my girl, you too, my son-in-law,
 and the little one on both cheeks. I am, with best compliments, your
 loving father.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Theodore Rouault."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She held the coarse paper in her fingers for some minutes. The spelling
 mistakes were interwoven one with the other, and Emma followed the kindly
 thought that cackled right through it like a hen half hidden in the hedge
 of thorns. The writing had been dried with ashes from the hearth, for a
 little grey powder slipped from the letter on to her dress, and she almost
 thought she saw her father bending over the hearth to take up the tongs.
 How long since she had been with him, sitting on the footstool in the
 chimney-corner, where she used to burn the end of a bit of wood in the
 great flame of the sea-sedges! She remembered the summer evenings all full
 of sunshine. The colts neighed when anyone passed by, and galloped,
 galloped. Under her window there was a beehive, and sometimes the bees
 wheeling round in the light struck against her window like rebounding
 balls of gold. What happiness there had been at that time, what freedom,
 what hope! What an abundance of illusions! Nothing was left of them now.
 She had got rid of them all in her soul's life, in all her successive
 conditions of life, maidenhood, her marriage, and her love?thus
 constantly losing them all her life through, like a traveller who leaves
 something of his wealth at every inn along his road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But what then, made her so unhappy? What was the extraordinary catastrophe
 that had transformed her? And she raised her head, looking round as if to
 seek the cause of that which made her suffer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An April ray was dancing on the china of the whatnot; the fire burned;
 beneath her slippers she felt the softness of the carpet; the day was
 bright, the air warm, and she heard her child shouting with laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst of
 the grass that was being turned. She was lying flat on her stomach at the
 top of a rick. The servant was holding her by her skirt. Lestiboudois was
 raking by her side, and every time he came near she lent forward, beating
 the air with both her arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bring her to me," said her mother, rushing to embrace her. "How I love
 you, my poor child! How I love you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then noticing that the tips of her ears were rather dirty, she rang at
 once for warm water, and washed her, changed her linen, her stockings, her
 shoes, asked a thousand questions about her health, as if on the return
 from a long journey, and finally, kissing her again and crying a little,
 she gave her back to the servant, who stood quite thunderstricken at this
 excess of tenderness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That evening Rodolphe found her more serious than usual.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That will pass over," he concluded; "it's a whim:"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he missed three rendezvous running. When he did come, she showed
 herself cold and almost contemptuous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you're losing your time, my lady!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he pretended not to notice her melancholy sighs, nor the handkerchief
 she took out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Emma repented. She even asked herself why she detested Charles; if it
 had not been better to have been able to love him? But he gave her no
 opportunities for such a revival of sentiment, so that she was much
 embarrassed by her desire for sacrifice, when the druggist came just in
 time to provide her with an opportunity.

 <h2>
 Chapter Eleven
 </h2>
 <p>
 He had recently read a eulogy on a new method for curing club-foot, and as
 he was a partisan of progress, he conceived the patriotic idea that
 Yonville, in order to keep to the fore, ought to have some operations for
 strephopody or club-foot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For," said he to Emma, "what risk is there? See?" (and he
 enumerated on his fingers the advantages of the attempt), "success, almost
 certain relief and beautifying of the patient, celebrity acquired by the
 operator. Why, for example, should not your husband relieve poor Hippolyte
 of the 'Lion d'Or'? Note that he would not fail to tell about his cure to
 all the travellers, and then" (Homais lowered his voice and looked round
 him) "who is to prevent me from sending a short paragraph on the subject
 to the paper? Eh! goodness me! an article gets about; it is talked of; it
 ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who knows?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, Bovary might succeed. Nothing proved to Emma that he was not
 clever; and what a satisfaction for her to have urged him to a step by
 which his reputation and fortune would be increased! She only wished to
 lean on something more solid than love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, urged by the druggist and by her, allowed himself to be
 persuaded. He sent to Rouen for Dr. Duval's volume, and every evening,
 holding his head between both hands, plunged into the reading of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While he was studying equinus, varus, and valgus, that is to say,
 katastrephopody, endostrephopody, and exostrephopody (or better, the
 various turnings of the foot downwards, inwards, and outwards, with the
 hypostrephopody and anastrephopody), otherwise torsion downwards and
 upwards, Monsier Homais, with all sorts of arguments, was exhorting the
 lad at the inn to submit to the operation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple prick,
 like a little blood-letting, less than the extraction of certain corns."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hippolyte, reflecting, rolled his stupid eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "However," continued the chemist, "it doesn't concern me. It's for your
 sake, for pure humanity! I should like to see you, my friend, rid of your
 hideous caudication, together with that waddling of the lumbar regions
 which, whatever you say, must considerably interfere with you in the
 exercise of your calling."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Homais represented to him how much jollier and brisker he would feel
 afterwards, and even gave him to understand that he would be more likely
 to please the women; and the stable-boy began to smile heavily. Then he
 attacked him through his vanity:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you a man? Hang it! what would you have done if you had had to go
 into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard? Ah! Hippolyte!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this obstinacy,
 this blindness in refusing the benefactions of science.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poor fellow gave way, for it was like a conspiracy. Binet, who never
 interfered with other people's business, Madame Lefrancois, Artemise, the
 neighbours, even the mayor, Monsieur Tuvache?everyone persuaded him,
 lectured him, shamed him; but what finally decided him was that it would
 cost him nothing. Bovary even undertook to provide the machine for the
 operation. This generosity was an idea of Emma's, and Charles consented to
 it, thinking in his heart of hearts that his wife was an angel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he had a
 kind of box made by the carpenter, with the aid of the locksmith, that
 weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron, wood, sheer-iron, leather,
 screws, and nuts had not been spared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But to know which of Hippolyte's tendons to cut, it was necessary first of
 all to find out what kind of club-foot he had.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which, however,
 did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was an equinus
 together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with a strong
 tendency to equinus. But with this equinus, wide in foot like a horse's
 hoof, with rugose skin, dry tendons, and large toes, on which the black
 nails looked as if made of iron, the clubfoot ran about like a deer from
 morn till night. He was constantly to be seen on the Place, jumping round
 the carts, thrusting his limping foot forwards. He seemed even stronger on
 that leg than the other. By dint of hard service it had acquired, as it
 were, moral qualities of patience and energy; and when he was given some
 heavy work, he stood on it in preference to its fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, as it was an equinus, it was necessary to cut the tendon of Achilles,
 and, if need were, the anterior tibial muscle could be seen to afterwards
 for getting rid of the varus; for the doctor did not dare to risk both
 operations at once; he was even trembling already for fear of injuring
 some important region that he did not know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Neither Ambrose Pare, applying for the first time since Celsus, after an
 interval of fifteen centuries, a ligature to an artery, nor Dupuytren,
 about to open an abscess in the brain, nor Gensoul when he first took away
 the superior maxilla, had hearts that trembled, hands that shook, minds so
 strained as Monsieur Bovary when he approached Hippolyte, his tenotome
 between his fingers. And as at hospitals, near by on a table lay a heap of
 lint, with waxed thread, many bandages?a pyramid of bandages?every
 bandage to be found at the druggist's. It was Monsieur Homais who since
 morning had been organising all these preparations, as much to dazzle the
 multitude as to keep up his illusions. Charles pierced the skin; a dry
 crackling was heard. The tendon was cut, the operation over. Hippolyte
 could not get over his surprise, but bent over Bovary's hands to cover
 them with kisses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, be calm," said the druggist; "later on you will show your gratitude
 to your benefactor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he went down to tell the result to five or six inquirers who were
 waiting in the yard, and who fancied that Hippolyte would reappear walking
 properly. Then Charles, having buckled his patient into the machine, went
 home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him at the door. She threw herself
 on his neck; they sat down to table; he ate much, and at dessert he even
 wanted to take a cup of coffee, a luxury he only permitted himself on
 Sundays when there was company.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together. They talked
 about their future fortune, of the improvements to be made in their house;
 he saw people's estimation of him growing, his comforts increasing, his
 wife always loving him; and she was happy to refresh herself with a new
 sentiment, healthier, better, to feel at last some tenderness for this
 poor fellow who adored her. The thought of Rodolphe for one moment passed
 through her mind, but her eyes turned again to Charles; she even noticed
 with surprise that he had not bad teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were in bed when Monsieur Homais, in spite of the servant, suddenly
 entered the room, holding in his hand a sheet of paper just written. It
 was the paragraph he intended for the "Fanal de Rouen." He brought it for
 them to read.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Read it yourself," said Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He read?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of the face of Europe
 like a net, the light nevertheless begins to penetrate our country places.
 Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found itself the scene of a
 surgical operation which is at the same time an act of loftiest
 philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished practitioners?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that is too much! too much!" said Charles, choking with emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no! not at all! What next!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'?Performed an operation on a club-footed man.' I have not used the
 scientific term, because you know in a newspaper everyone would not
 perhaps understand. The masses must?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No doubt," said Bovary; "go on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I proceed," said the chemist. "'Monsieur Bovary, one of our most
 distinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a club-footed man
 called Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last twenty-five years at the
 hotel of the "Lion d'Or," kept by Widow Lefrancois, at the Place d'Armes.
 The novelty of the attempt, and the interest incident to the subject, had
 attracted such a concourse of persons that there was a veritable
 obstruction on the threshold of the establishment. The operation,
 moreover, was performed as if by magic, and barely a few drops of blood
 appeared on the skin, as though to say that the rebellious tendon had at
 last given way beneath the efforts of art. The patient, strangely enough?we
 affirm it as an eye-witness?complained of no pain. His condition up
 to the present time leaves nothing to be desired. Everything tends to show
 that his convelescence will be brief; and who knows even if at our next
 village festivity we shall not see our good Hippolyte figuring in the
 bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus of joyous boon-companions, and thus
 proving to all eyes by his verve and his capers his complete cure? Honour,
 then, to the generous savants! Honour to those indefatigable spirits who
 consecrate their vigils to the amelioration or to the alleviation of their
 kind! Honour, thrice honour! Is it not time to cry that the blind shall
 see, the deaf hear, the lame walk? But that which fanaticism formerly
 promised to its elect, science now accomplishes for all men. We shall keep
 our readers informed as to the successive phases of this remarkable
 cure.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This did not prevent Mere Lefrancois, from coming five days after, scared,
 and crying out?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Help! he is dying! I am going crazy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles rushed to the "Lion d'Or," and the chemist, who caught sight of
 him passing along the Place hatless, abandoned his shop. He appeared
 himself breathless, red, anxious, and asking everyone who was going up the
 stairs?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what's the matter with our interesting strephopode?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The strephopode was writhing in hideous convulsions, so that the machine
 in which his leg was enclosed was knocked against the wall enough to break
 it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of the limb,
 the box was removed, and an awful sight presented itself. The outlines of
 the foot disappeared in such a swelling that the entire skin seemed about
 to burst, and it was covered with ecchymosis, caused by the famous
 machine. Hippolyte had already complained of suffering from it. No
 attention had been paid to him; they had to acknowledge that he had not
 been altogether wrong, and he was freed for a few hours. But, hardly had
 the oedema gone down to some extent, than the two savants thought fit to
 put back the limb in the apparatus, strapping it tighter to hasten
 matters. At last, three days after, Hippolyte being unable to endure it
 any longer, they once more removed the machine, and were much surprised at
 the result they saw. The livid tumefaction spread over the leg, with
 blisters here and there, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters were
 taking a serious turn. Hippolyte began to worry himself, and Mere
 Lefrancois, had him installed in the little room near the kitchen, so that
 he might at least have some distraction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the tax-collector, who dined there every day, complained bitterly of
 such companionship. Then Hippolyte was removed to the billiard-room. He
 lay there moaning under his heavy coverings, pale with long beard, sunken
 eyes, and from time to time turning his perspiring head on the dirty
 pillow, where the flies alighted. Madame Bovary went to see him. She
 brought him linen for his poultices; she comforted, and encouraged him.
 Besides, he did not want for company, especially on market-days, when the
 peasants were knocking about the billiard-balls round him, fenced with the
 cues, smoked, drank, sang, and brawled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you?" they said, clapping him on the shoulder. "Ah! you're not up
 to much, it seems, but it's your own fault. You should do this! do that!"
 And then they told him stories of people who had all been cured by other
 remedies than his. Then by way of consolation they added?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You give way too much! Get up! You coddle yourself like a king! All the
 same, old chap, you don't smell nice!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gangrene, in fact, was spreading more and more. Bovary himself turned sick
 at it. He came every hour, every moment. Hippolyte looked at him with eyes
 full of terror, sobbing?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When shall I get well? Oh, save me! How unfortunate I am! How unfortunate
 I am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the doctor left, always recommending him to diet himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't listen to him, my lad," said Mere Lefrancois, "Haven't they
 tortured you enough already? You'll grow still weaker. Here! swallow
 this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she gave him some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece of bacon,
 and sometimes small glasses of brandy, that he had not the strength to put
 to his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Abbe Bournisien, hearing that he was growing worse, asked to see him. He
 began by pitying his sufferings, declaring at the same time that he ought
 to rejoice at them since it was the will of the Lord, and take advantage
 of the occasion to reconcile himself to Heaven.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For," said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, "you rather neglected
 your duties; you were rarely seen at divine worship. How many years is it
 since you approached the holy table? I understand that your work, that the
 whirl of the world may have kept you from care for your salvation. But now
 is the time to reflect. Yet don't despair. I have known great sinners,
 who, about to appear before God (you are not yet at this point I know),
 had implored His mercy, and who certainly died in the best frame of mind.
 Let us hope that, like them, you will set us a good example. Thus, as a
 precaution, what is to prevent you from saying morning and evening a 'Hail
 Mary, full of grace,' and 'Our Father which art in heaven'? Yes, do that,
 for my sake, to oblige me. That won't cost you anything. Will you promise
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poor devil promised. The cure came back day after day. He chatted with
 the landlady; and even told anecdotes interspersed with jokes and puns
 that Hippolyte did not understand. Then, as soon as he could, he fell back
 upon matters of religion, putting on an appropriate expression of face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His zeal seemed successful, for the club-foot soon manifested a desire to
 go on a pilgrimage to Bon-Secours if he were cured; to which Monsieur
 Bournisien replied that he saw no objection; two precautions were better
 than one; it was no risk anyhow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The druggist was indignant at what he called the manoeuvres of the priest;
 they were prejudicial, he said, to Hippolyte's convalescence, and he kept
 repeating to Madame Lefrancois, "Leave him alone! leave him alone! You
 perturb his morals with your mysticism." But the good woman would no
 longer listen to him; he was the cause of it all. From a spirit of
 contradiction she hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin filled
 with holy-water and a branch of box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Religion, however, seemed no more able to succour him than surgery, and
 the invincible gangrene still spread from the extremities towards the
 stomach. It was all very well to vary the potions and change the
 poultices; the muscles each day rotted more and more; and at last Charles
 replied by an affirmative nod of the head when Mere Lefrancois, asked him
 if she could not, as a forlorn hope, send for Monsieur Canivet of
 Neufchatel, who was a celebrity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A doctor of medicine, fifty years of age, enjoying a good position and
 self-possessed, Charles's colleague did not refrain from laughing
 disdainfully when he had uncovered the leg, mortified to the knee. Then
 having flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the
 chemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such a
 state. Shaking Monsieur Homais by the button of his coat, he shouted out
 in the shop?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These are the inventions of Paris! These are the ideas of those gentry of
 the capital! It is like strabismus, chloroform, lithotrity, a heap of
 monstrosities that the Government ought to prohibit. But they want to do
 the clever, and they cram you with remedies without, troubling about the
 consequences. We are not so clever, not we! We are not savants, coxcombs,
 fops! We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should not dream of
 operating on anyone who is in perfect health. Straighten club-feet! As if
 one could straighten club-feet! It is as if one wished, for example, to
 make a hunchback straight!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais suffered as he listened to this discourse, and he concealed his
 discomfort beneath a courtier's smile; for he needed to humour Monsier
 Canivet, whose prescriptions sometimes came as far as Yonville. So he did
 not take up the defence of Bovary; he did not even make a single remark,
 and, renouncing his principles, he sacrificed his dignity to the more
 serious interests of his business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This amputation of the thigh by Doctor Canivet was a great event in the
 village. On that day all the inhabitants got up earlier, and the Grande
 Rue, although full of people, had something lugubrious about it, as if an
 execution had been expected. At the grocer's they discussed Hippolyte's
 illness; the shops did no business, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife,
 did not stir from her window, such was her impatience to see the operator
 arrive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came in his gig, which he drove himself. But the springs of the right
 side having at length given way beneath the weight of his corpulence, it
 happened that the carriage as it rolled along leaned over a little, and on
 the other cushion near him could be seen a large box covered in red
 sheep-leather, whose three brass clasps shone grandly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After he had entered like a whirlwind the porch of the "Lion d'Or," the
 doctor, shouting very loud, ordered them to unharness his horse. Then he
 went into the stable to see that he was eating his oats all right; for on
 arriving at a patient's he first of all looked after his mare and his gig.
 People even said about this?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Monsieur Canivet's a character!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The universe
 to the last man might have died, and he would not have missed the smallest
 of his habits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Homais presented himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I count on you," said the doctor. "Are we ready? Come along!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the druggist, turning red, confessed that he was too sensitive to
 assist at such an operation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When one is a simple spectator," he said, "the imagination, you know, is
 impressed. And then I have such a nervous system!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pshaw!" interrupted Canivet; "on the contrary, you seem to me inclined to
 apoplexy. Besides, that doesn't astonish me, for you chemist fellows are
 always poking about your kitchens, which must end by spoiling your
 constitutions. Now just look at me. I get up every day at four o'clock; I
 shave with cold water (and am never cold). I don't wear flannels, and I
 never catch cold; my carcass is good enough! I live now in one way, now in
 another, like a philosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I am not
 squeamish like you, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a Christian as
 the first fowl that turns up. Then, perhaps, you will say, habit! habit!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with agony
 between his sheets, these gentlemen entered into a conversation, in which
 the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a general; and
 this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out on the
 exigencies of his art. He looked upon, it as a sacred office, although the
 ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming back to the
 patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same that had
 appeared for the club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for
 him. Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having turned up his
 sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist stayed with
 Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons, and with ears
 strained towards the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bovary during this time did not dare to stir from his house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless
 chimney, his chin on his breast, his hands clasped, his eyes staring.
 "What a mishap!" he thought, "what a mishap!" Perhaps, after all, he had
 made some slip. He thought it over, but could hit upon nothing. But the
 most famous surgeons also made mistakes; and that is what no one would
 ever believe! People, on the contrary, would laugh, jeer! It would spread
 as far as Forges, as Neufchatel, as Rouen, everywhere! Who could say if
 his colleagues would not write against him. Polemics would ensue; he would
 have to answer in the papers. Hippolyte might even prosecute him. He saw
 himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and his imagination, assailed by a
 world of hypotheses, tossed amongst them like an empty cask borne by the
 sea and floating upon the waves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, opposite, watched him; she did not share his humiliation; she felt
 another?that of having supposed such a man was worth anything. As if
 twenty times already she had not sufficiently perceived his mediocrity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit down," she said; "you fidget me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sat down again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How was it that she?she, who was so intelligent?could have
 allowed herself to be deceived again? and through what deplorable madness
 had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices? She recalled all her
 instincts of luxury, all the privations of her soul, the sordidness of
 marriage, of the household, her dream sinking into the mire like wounded
 swallows; all that she had longed for, all that she had denied herself,
 all that she might have had! And for what? for what?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the midst of the silence that hung over the village a heart-rending cry
 rose on the air. Bovary turned white to fainting. She knit her brows with
 a nervous gesture, then went on. And it was for him, for this creature,
 for this man, who understood nothing, who felt nothing! For he was there
 quite quiet, not even suspecting that the ridicule of his name would
 henceforth sully hers as well as his. She had made efforts to love him,
 and she had repented with tears for having yielded to another!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it was perhaps a valgus!" suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was
 meditating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought like a
 leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised her head in
 order to find out what he meant to say; and they looked at the other in
 silence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they by
 their inner thoughts. Charles gazed at her with the dull look of a drunken
 man, while he listened motionless to the last cries of the sufferer, that
 followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by sharp spasms like
 the far-off howling of some beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her wan
 lips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral that she had
 broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes like two arrows of
 fire about to dart forth. Everything in him irritated her now; his face,
 his dress, what he did not say, his whole person, his existence, in fine.
 She repented of her past virtue as of a crime, and what still remained of
 it rumbled away beneath the furious blows of her pride. She revelled in
 all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover came
 back to her with dazzling attractions; she threw her whole soul into it,
 borne away towards this image with a fresh enthusiasm; and Charles seemed
 to her as much removed from her life, as absent forever, as impossible and
 annihilated, as if he had been about to die and were passing under her
 eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a sound of steps on the pavement. Charles looked up, and through
 the lowered blinds he saw at the corner of the market in the broad
 sunshine Dr. Canivet, who was wiping his brow with his handkerchief.
 Homais, behind him, was carrying a large red box in his hand, and both
 were going towards the chemist's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then with a feeling of sudden tenderness and discouragement Charles turned
 to his wife saying to her?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, kiss me, my own!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave me!" she said, red with anger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the matter?" he asked, stupefied. "Be calm; compose yourself. You
 know well enough that I love you. Come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Enough!" she cried with a terrible look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And escaping from the room, Emma closed the door so violently that the
 barometer fell from the wall and smashed on the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover what
 could be wrong with her, fancying some nervous illness, weeping, and
 vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible whirling round him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Rodolphe came to the garden that evening, he found his mistress
 waiting for him at the foot of the steps on the lowest stair. They threw
 their arms round one another, and all their rancour melted like snow
 beneath the warmth of that kiss.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter Twelve
 </h2>
 <p>
 They began to love one another again. Often, even in the middle of the
 day, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made a sign to
 Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette. Rodolphe
 would come; she had sent for him to tell him that she was bored, that her
 husband was odious, her life frightful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what can I do?" he cried one day impatiently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! if you would?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was sitting on the floor between his knees, her hair loose, her look
 lost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what?" said Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We would go and live elsewhere?somewhere!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are really mad!" he said laughing. "How could that be possible?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and turned
 the conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What he did not understand was all this worry about so simple an affair as
 love. She had a motive, a reason, and, as it were, a pendant to her
 affection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her repulsion to her husband.
 The more she gave up herself to the one, the more she loathed the other.
 Never had Charles seemed to her so disagreeable, to have such stodgy
 fingers, such vulgar ways, to be so dull as when they found themselves
 together after her meeting with Rodolphe. Then, while playing the spouse
 and virtue, she was burning at the thought of that head whose black hair
 fell in a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once so strong and
 elegant, of that man, in a word, who had such experience in his reasoning,
 such passion in his desires. It was for him that she filed her nails with
 the care of a chaser, and that there was never enough cold-cream for her
 skin, nor of patchouli for her handkerchiefs. She loaded herself with
 bracelets, rings, and necklaces. When he was coming she filled the two
 large blue glass vases with roses, and prepared her room and her person
 like a courtesan expecting a prince. The servant had to be constantly
 washing linen, and all day Felicite did not stir from the kitchen, where
 little Justin, who often kept her company, watched her at work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With his elbows on the long board on which she was ironing, he greedily
 watched all these women's clothes spread about him, the dimity petticoats,
 the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with running strings, wide at the
 hips and growing narrower below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is that for?" asked the young fellow, passing his hand over the
 crinoline or the hooks and eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, haven't you ever seen anything?" Felicite answered laughing. "As if
 your mistress, Madame Homais, didn't wear the same."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I daresay! Madame Homais!" And he added with a meditative air, "As if
 she were a lady like madame!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Felicite grew impatient of seeing him hanging round her. She was six
 years older than he, and Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, was
 beginning to pay court to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let me alone," she said, moving her pot of starch. "You'd better be off
 and pound almonds; you are always dangling about women. Before you meddle
 with such things, bad boy, wait till you've got a beard to your chin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't be cross! I'll go and clean her boots."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he at once took down from the shelf Emma's boots, all coated with mud,
 the mud of the rendezvous, that crumbled into powder beneath his fingers,
 and that he watched as it gently rose in a ray of sunlight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How afraid you are of spoiling them!" said the servant, who wasn't so
 particular when she cleaned them herself, because as soon as the stuff of
 the boots was no longer fresh madame handed them over to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma had a number in her cupboard that she squandered one after the other,
 without Charles allowing himself the slightest observation. So also he
 disbursed three hundred francs for a wooden leg that she thought proper to
 make a present of to Hippolyte. Its top was covered with cork, and it had
 spring joints, a complicated mechanism, covered over by black trousers
 ending in a patent-leather boot. But Hippolyte, not daring to use such a
 handsome leg every day, begged Madame Bovary to get him another more
 convenient one. The doctor, of course, had again to defray the expense of
 this purchase.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So little by little the stable-man took up his work again. One saw him
 running about the village as before, and when Charles heard from afar the
 sharp noise of the wooden leg, he at once went in another direction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the order;
 this provided him with an excuse for visiting Emma. He chatted with her
 about the new goods from Paris, about a thousand feminine trifles, made
 himself very obliging, and never asked for his money. Emma yielded to this
 lazy mode of satisfying all her caprices. Thus she wanted to have a very
 handsome ridding-whip that was at an umbrella-maker's at Rouen to give to
 Rodolphe. The week after Monsieur Lheureux placed it on her table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the next day he called on her with a bill for two hundred and seventy
 francs, not counting the centimes. Emma was much embarrassed; all the
 drawers of the writing-table were empty; they owed over a fortnight's
 wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters to the servant, for any quantity of
 other things, and Bovary was impatiently expecting Monsieur Derozeray's
 account, which he was in the habit of paying every year about Midsummer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She succeeded at first in putting off Lheureux. At last he lost patience;
 he was being sued; his capital was out, and unless he got some in he
 should be forced to take back all the goods she had received.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well, take them!" said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was only joking," he replied; "the only thing I regret is the whip. My
 word! I'll ask monsieur to return it to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no!" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! I've got you!" thought Lheureux.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, certain of his discovery, he went out repeating to himself in an
 undertone, and with his usual low whistle?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! we shall see! we shall see!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in put on
 the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper "from Monsieur Derozeray's."
 Emma pounced upon and opened it. It contained fifteen napoleons; it was
 the account. She heard Charles on the stairs; threw the gold to the back
 of her drawer, and took out the key.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Three days after Lheureux reappeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have an arrangement to suggest to you," he said. "If, instead of the
 sum agreed on, you would take?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here it is," she said placing fourteen napoleons in his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tradesman was dumfounded. Then, to conceal his disappointment, he was
 profuse in apologies and proffers of service, all of which Emma declined;
 then she remained a few moments fingering in the pocket of her apron the
 two five-franc pieces that he had given her in change. She promised
 herself she would economise in order to pay back later on. "Pshaw!" she
 thought, "he won't think about it again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides the riding-whip with its silver-gilt handle, Rodolphe had received
 a seal with the motto Amor nel cor* furthermore, a scarf for a muffler,
 and, finally, a cigar-case exactly like the Viscount's, that Charles had
 formerly picked up in the road, and that Emma had kept. These presents,
 however, humiliated him; he refused several; she insisted, and he ended by
 obeying, thinking her tyrannical and overexacting.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *A loving heart.
</pre>
 <p>
 Then she had strange ideas.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When midnight strikes," she said, "you must think of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And if he confessed that he had not thought of her, there were floods of
 reproaches that always ended with the eternal question?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you love me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, of course I love you," he answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A great deal?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You haven't loved any others?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you think you'd got a virgin?" he exclaimed laughing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his protestations with
 puns.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh," she went on, "I love you! I love you so that I could not live
 without you, do you see? There are times when I long to see you again,
 when I am torn by all the anger of love. I ask myself, Where is he?
 Perhaps he is talking to other women. They smile upon him; he approaches.
 Oh no; no one else pleases you. There are some more beautiful, but I love
 you best. I know how to love best. I am your servant, your concubine! You
 are my king, my idol! You are good, you are beautiful, you are clever, you
 are strong!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had so often heard these things said that they did not strike him as
 original. Emma was like all his mistresses; and the charm of novelty,
 gradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the eternal monotony of
 passion, that has always the same forms and the same language. He did not
 distinguish, this man of so much experience, the difference of sentiment
 beneath the sameness of expression. Because lips libertine and venal had
 murmured such words to him, he believed but little in the candour of hers;
 exaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be discounted; as if
 the fullness of the soul did not sometimes overflow in the emptiest
 metaphors, since no one can ever give the exact measure of his needs, nor
 of his conceptions, nor of his sorrows; and since human speech is like a
 cracked tin kettle, on which we hammer out tunes to make bears dance when
 we long to move the stars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But with that superior critical judgment that belongs to him who, in no
 matter what circumstance, holds back, Rodolphe saw other delights to be
 got out of this love. He thought all modesty in the way. He treated her
 quite sans facon.* He made of her something supple and corrupt. Hers was
 an idiotic sort of attachment, full of admiration for him, of
 voluptuousness for her, a beatitude that benumbed her; her soul sank into
 this drunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in his butt
 of Malmsey.
 </p><br>

 <p>
 By the mere effect of her love Madame Bovary's manners changed. Her looks
 grew bolder, her speech more free; she even committed the impropriety of
 walking out with Monsieur Rodolphe, a cigarette in her mouth, "as if to
 defy the people." At last, those who still doubted doubted no longer when
 one day they saw her getting out of the "Hirondelle," her waist squeezed
 into a waistcoat like a man; and Madame Bovary senior, who, after a
 fearful scene with her husband, had taken refuge at her son's, was not the
 least scandalised of the women-folk. Many other things displeased her.
 First, Charles had not attended to her advice about the forbidding of
 novels; then the "ways of the house" annoyed her; she allowed herself to
 make some remarks, and there were quarrels, especially one on account of
 Felicite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary senior, the evening before, passing along the passage, had
 surprised her in company of a man?a man with a brown collar, about
 forty years old, who, at the sound of her step, had quickly escaped
 through the kitchen. Then Emma began to laugh, but the good lady grew
 angry, declaring that unless morals were to be laughed at one ought to
 look after those of one's servants.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where were you brought up?" asked the daughter-in-law, with so
 impertinent a look that Madame Bovary asked her if she were not perhaps
 defending her own case.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave the room!" said the young woman, springing up with a bound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Emma! Mamma!" cried Charles, trying to reconcile them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But both had fled in their exasperation. Emma was stamping her feet as she
 repeated?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! what manners! What a peasant!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He ran to his mother; she was beside herself. She stammered
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is an insolent, giddy-headed thing, or perhaps worse!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she was for leaving at once if the other did not apologise. So Charles
 went back again to his wife and implored her to give way; he knelt to her;
 she ended by saying?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well! I'll go to her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And in fact she held out her hand to her mother-in-law with the dignity of
 a marchioness as she said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Excuse me, madame."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, having gone up again to her room, she threw herself flat on her bed
 and cried there like a child, her face buried in the pillow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She and Rodolphe had agreed that in the event of anything extraordinary
 occurring, she should fasten a small piece of white paper to the blind, so
 that if by chance he happened to be in Yonville, he could hurry to the
 lane behind the house. Emma made the signal; she had been waiting
 three-quarters of an hour when she suddenly caught sight of Rodolphe at
 the corner of the market. She felt tempted to open the window and call
 him, but he had already disappeared. She fell back in despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon, however, it seemed to her that someone was walking on the pavement.
 It was he, no doubt. She went downstairs, crossed the yard. He was there
 outside. She threw herself into his arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do take care!" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! if you knew!" she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she began telling him everything, hurriedly, disjointedly,
 exaggerating the facts, inventing many, and so prodigal of parentheses
 that he understood nothing of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, my poor angel, courage! Be comforted! be patient!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I have been patient; I have suffered for four years. A love like ours
 ought to show itself in the face of heaven. They torture me! I can bear it
 no longer! Save me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She clung to Rodolphe. Her eyes, full of tears, flashed like flames
 beneath a wave; her breast heaved; he had never loved her so much, so that
 he lost his head and said "What is, it? What do you wish?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take me away," she cried, "carry me off! Oh, I pray you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she threw herself upon his mouth, as if to seize there the unexpected
 consent if breathed forth in a kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But?" Rodolphe resumed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your little girl!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She reflected a few moments, then replied?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We will take her! It can't be helped!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a woman!" he said to himself, watching her as she went. For she had
 run into the garden. Someone was calling her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the following days Madame Bovary senior was much surprised at the
 change in her daughter-in-law. Emma, in fact, was showing herself more
 docile, and even carried her deference so far as to ask for a recipe for
 pickling gherkins.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Was it the better to deceive them both? Or did she wish by a sort of
 voluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness of the
 things she was about to leave?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she paid no heed to them; on the contrary, she lived as lost in the
 anticipated delight of her coming happiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe. She leant on his
 shoulder murmuring?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! when we are in the mail-coach! Do you think about it? Can it be? It
 seems to me that the moment I feel the carriage start, it will be as if we
 were rising in a balloon, as if we were setting out for the clouds. Do you
 know that I count the hours? And you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Never had Madame Bovary been so beautiful as at this period; she had that
 indefinable beauty that results from joy, from enthusiasm, from success,
 and that is only the harmony of temperament with circumstances. Her
 desires, her sorrows, the experience of pleasure, and her ever-young
 illusions, that had, as soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers
 grow, gradually developed her, and she at length blossomed forth in all
 the plenitude of her nature. Her eyelids seemed chiselled expressly for
 her long amorous looks in which the pupil disappeared, while a strong
 inspiration expanded her delicate nostrils and raised the fleshy corner of
 her lips, shaded in the light by a little black down. One would have
 thought that an artist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair
 upon her neck; they fell in a thick mass, negligently, and with the
 changing chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day. Her voice
 now took more mellow infections, her figure also; something subtle and
 penetrating escaped even from the folds of her gown and from the line of
 her foot. Charles, as when they were first married, thought her delicious
 and quite irresistible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came home in the middle of the night, he did not dare to wake her.
 The porcelain night-light threw a round trembling gleam upon the ceiling,
 and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed as it were a white hut
 standing out in the shade, and by the bedside Charles looked at them. He
 seemed to hear the light breathing of his child. She would grow big now;
 every season would bring rapid progress. He already saw her coming from
 school as the day drew in, laughing, with ink-stains on her jacket, and
 carrying her basket on her arm. Then she would have to be sent to the
 boarding-school; that would cost much; how was it to be done? Then he
 reflected. He thought of hiring a small farm in the neighbourhood, that he
 would superintend every morning on his way to his patients. He would save
 up what he brought in; he would put it in the savings-bank. Then he would
 buy shares somewhere, no matter where; besides, his practice would
 increase; he counted upon that, for he wanted Berthe to be well-educated,
 to be accomplished, to learn to play the piano. Ah! how pretty she would
 be later on when she was fifteen, when, resembling her mother, she would,
 like her, wear large straw hats in the summer-time; from a distance they
 would be taken for two sisters. He pictured her to himself working in the
 evening by their side beneath the light of the lamp; she would embroider
 him slippers; she would look after the house; she would fill all the home
 with her charm and her gaiety. At last, they would think of her marriage;
 they would find her some good young fellow with a steady business; he
 would make her happy; this would last for ever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was not asleep; she pretended to be; and while he dozed off by her
 side she awakened to other dreams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the gallop of four horses she was carried away for a week towards a new
 land, whence they would return no more. They went on and on, their arms
 entwined, without a word. Often from the top of a mountain there suddenly
 glimpsed some splendid city with domes, and bridges, and ships, forests of
 citron trees, and cathedrals of white marble, on whose pointed steeples
 were storks' nests. They went at a walking-pace because of the great
 flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers, offered you
 by women dressed in red bodices. They heard the chiming of bells, the
 neighing of mules, together with the murmur of guitars and the noise of
 fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps of fruit arranged like a
 pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled beneath playing waters.
 And then, one night they came to a fishing village, where brown nets were
 drying in the wind along the cliffs and in front of the huts. It was there
 that they would stay; they would live in a low, flat-roofed house, shaded
 by a palm-tree, in the heart of a gulf, by the sea. They would row in
 gondolas, swing in hammocks, and their existence would be easy and large
 as their silk gowns, warm and star-spangled as the nights they would
 contemplate. However, in the immensity of this future that she conjured
 up, nothing special stood forth; the days, all magnificent, resembled each
 other like waves; and it swayed in the horizon, infinite, harmonised,
 azure, and bathed in sunshine. But the child began to cough in her cot or
 Bovary snored more loudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when
 the dawn whitened the windows, and when little Justin was already in the
 square taking down the shutters of the chemist's shop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had sent for Monsieur Lheureux, and had said to him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want a cloak?a large lined cloak with a deep collar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are going on a journey?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; but?never mind. I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He bowed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides, I shall want," she went on, "a trunk?not too heavy?handy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, I understand. About three feet by a foot and a half, as they
 are being made just now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And a travelling bag."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Decidedly," thought Lheureux, "there's a row on here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And," said Madame Bovary, taking her watch from her belt, "take this; you
 can pay yourself out of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one another; did
 he doubt her? What childishness!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and Lheureux had
 already put it in his pocket and was going, when she called him back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will leave everything at your place. As to the cloak"?she
 seemed to be reflecting?"do not bring it either; you can give me the
 maker's address, and tell him to have it ready for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the next month that they were to run away. She was to leave
 Yonville as if she was going on some business to Rouen. Rodolphe would
 have booked the seats, procured the passports, and even have written to
 Paris in order to have the whole mail-coach reserved for them as far as
 Marseilles, where they would buy a carriage, and go on thence without
 stopping to Genoa. She would take care to send her luggage to Lheureux
 whence it would be taken direct to the "Hirondelle," so that no one would
 have any suspicion. And in all this there never was any allusion to the
 child. Rodolphe avoided speaking of her; perhaps he no longer thought
 about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wished to have two more weeks before him to arrange some affairs; then
 at the end of a week he wanted two more; then he said he was ill; next he
 went on a journey. The month of August passed, and, after all these
 delays, they decided that it was to be irrevocably fixed for the 4th
 September?a Monday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length the Saturday before arrived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe came in the evening earlier than usual.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything is ready?" she asked him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they walked round a garden-bed, and went to sit down near the terrace
 on the kerb-stone of the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are sad," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet he looked at her strangely in a tender fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is because you are going away?" she went on; "because you are leaving
 what is dear to you?your life? Ah! I understand. I have nothing in
 the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. I will be your people,
 your country; I will tend, I will love you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How sweet you are!" he said, seizing her in his arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really!" she said with a voluptuous laugh. "Do you love me? Swear it
 then!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do I love you?love you? I adore you, my love."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The moon, full and purple-coloured, was rising right out of the earth at
 the end of the meadow. She rose quickly between the branches of the
 poplars, that hid her here and there like a black curtain pierced with
 holes. Then she appeared dazzling with whiteness in the empty heavens that
 she lit up, and now sailing more slowly along, let fall upon the river a
 great stain that broke up into an infinity of stars; and the silver sheen
 seemed to writhe through the very depths like a heedless serpent covered
 with luminous scales; it also resembled some monster candelabra all along
 which sparkled drops of diamonds running together. The soft night was
 about them; masses of shadow filled the branches. Emma, her eyes half
 closed, breathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind that was blowing. They
 did not speak, lost as they were in the rush of their reverie. The
 tenderness of the old days came back to their hearts, full and silent as
 the flowing river, with the softness of the perfume of the syringas, and
 threw across their memories shadows more immense and more sombre than
 those of the still willows that lengthened out over the grass. Often some
 night-animal, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on the hunt, disturbed the
 lovers, or sometimes they heard a ripe peach falling all alone from the
 espalier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! what a lovely night!" said Rodolphe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We shall have others," replied Emma; and, as if speaking to herself:
 "Yet, it will be good to travel. And yet, why should my heart be so heavy?
 Is it dread of the unknown? The effect of habits left? Or rather??
 No; it is the excess of happiness. How weak I am, am I not? Forgive me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is still time!" he cried. "Reflect! perhaps you may repent!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never!" she cried impetuously. And coming closer to him: "What ill could
 come to me? There is no desert, no precipice, no ocean I would not
 traverse with you. The longer we live together the more it will be like an
 embrace, every day closer, more heart to heart. There will be nothing to
 trouble us, no cares, no obstacle. We shall be alone, all to ourselves
 eternally. Oh, speak! Answer me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At regular intervals he answered, "Yes?Yes?" She had passed
 her hands through his hair, and she repeated in a childlike voice, despite
 the big tears which were falling, "Rodolphe! Rodolphe! Ah! Rodolphe! dear
 little Rodolphe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Midnight struck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Midnight!" said she. "Come, it is to-morrow. One day more!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rose to go; and as if the movement he made had been the signal for
 their flight, Emma said, suddenly assuming a gay air?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have the passports?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are forgetting nothing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you sure?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait for me at
 midday?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He nodded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till to-morrow then!" said Emma in a last caress; and she watched him go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not turn round. She ran after him, and, leaning over the water's
 edge between the bulrushes?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To-morrow!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across the
 meadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he saw her with her white
 gown gradually fade away in the shade like a ghost, he was seized with
 such a beating of the heart that he leant against a tree lest he should
 fall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What an imbecile I am!" he said with a fearful oath. "No matter! She was
 a pretty mistress!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And immediately Emma's beauty, with all the pleasures of their love, came
 back to him. For a moment he softened; then he rebelled against her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For, after all," he exclaimed, gesticulating, "I can't exile myself?have
 a child on my hands."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was saying these things to give himself firmness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And besides, the worry, the expense! Ah! no, no, no, no! a thousand times
 no! That would be too stupid."
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter Thirteen
 </h2>
 <p>
 No sooner was Rodolphe at home than he sat down quickly at his bureau
 under the stag's head that hung as a trophy on the wall. But when he had
 the pen between his fingers, he could think of nothing, so that, resting
 on his elbows, he began to reflect. Emma seemed to him to have receded
 into a far-off past, as if the resolution he had taken had suddenly placed
 a distance between them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the bedside
 an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he usually kept his letters from
 women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered roses. First he
 saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a handkerchief of hers.
 Once when they were walking her nose had bled; he had forgotten it. Near
 it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature given him by Emma: her
 toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst
 possible taste. Then, from looking at this image and recalling the memory
 of its original, Emma's features little by little grew confused in his
 remembrance, as if the living and the painted face, rubbing one against
 the other, had effaced each other. Finally, he read some of her letters;
 they were full of explanations relating to their journey, short,
 technical, and urgent, like business notes. He wanted to see the long ones
 again, those of old times. In order to find them at the bottom of the box,
 Rodolphe disturbed all the others, and mechanically began rummaging amidst
 this mass of papers and things, finding pell-mell bouquets, garters, a
 black mask, pins, and hair?hair! dark and fair, some even, catching
 in the hinges of the box, broke when it was opened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the style of
 the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were tender or jovial,
 facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love, others that
 asked for money. A word recalled faces to him, certain gestures, the sound
 of a voice; sometimes, however, he remembered nothing at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, these women, rushing at once into his thoughts, cramped each
 other and lessened, as reduced to a uniform level of love that equalised
 them all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up letters, he amused himself
 for some moments with letting them fall in cascades from his right into
 his left hand. At last, bored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to the
 cupboard, saying to himself, "What a lot of rubbish!" Which summed up his
 opinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard, had so
 trampled upon his heart that no green thing grew there, and that which
 passed through it, more heedless than children, did not even, like them,
 leave a name carved upon the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come," said he, "let's begin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wrote?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Courage, Emma! courage! I would not bring misery into your life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all, that's true," thought Rodolphe. "I am acting in her interest;
 I am honest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you carefully weighed your resolution? Do you know to what an abyss
 I was dragging you, poor angel? No, you do not, do you? You were coming
 confident and fearless, believing in happiness in the future. Ah! unhappy
 that we are?insensate!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I told her all my fortune is lost? No! Besides, that would stop
 nothing. It would all have to be begun over again later on. As if one
 could make women like that listen to reason!" He reflected, then went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a profound
 devotion for you; but some day, sooner or later, this ardour (such is the
 fate of human things) would have grown less, no doubt. Lassitude would
 have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the atrocious
 pain of witnessing your remorse, of sharing it myself, since I should have
 been its cause? The mere idea of the grief that would come to you tortures
 me, Emma. Forget me! Why did I ever know you? Why were you so beautiful?
 Is it my fault? O my God! No, no! Accuse only fate."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a word that always tells," he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, if you had been one of those frivolous women that one sees, certainly
 I might, through egotism, have tried an experiment, in that case without
 danger for you. But that delicious exaltation, at once your charm and your
 torment, has prevented you from understanding, adorable woman that you
 are, the falseness of our future position. Nor had I reflected upon this
 at first, and I rested in the shade of that ideal happiness as beneath
 that of the manchineel tree, without foreseeing the consequences."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps she'll think I'm giving it up from avarice. Ah, well! so much the
 worse; it must be stopped!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The world is cruel, Emma. Wherever we might have gone, it would have
 persecuted us. You would have had to put up with indiscreet questions,
 calumny, contempt, insult perhaps. Insult to you! Oh! And I, who would
 place you on a throne! I who bear with me your memory as a talisman! For I
 am going to punish myself by exile for all the ill I have done you. I am
 going away. Whither I know not. I am mad. Adieu! Be good always. Preserve
 the memory of the unfortunate who has lost you. Teach my name to your
 child; let her repeat it in her prayers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The wicks of the candles flickered. Rodolphe got up to, shut the window,
 and when he had sat down again?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think it's all right. Ah! and this for fear she should come and hunt me
 up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to
 flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again. No
 weakness! I shall return, and perhaps later on we shall talk together very
 coldly of our old love. Adieu!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And there was a last "adieu" divided into two words! "A Dieu!" which he
 thought in very excellent taste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now how am I to sign?" he said to himself. "'Yours devotedly?' No! 'Your
 friend?' Yes, that's it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He re-read his letter. He considered it very good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor little woman!" he thought with emotion. "She'll think me harder than
 a rock. There ought to have been some tears on this; but I can't cry; it
 isn't my fault." Then, having emptied some water into a glass, Rodolphe
 dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the paper, that made
 a pale stain on the ink. Then looking for a seal, he came upon the one
 "Amor nel cor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That doesn't at all fit in with the circumstances. Pshaw! never mind!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After which he smoked three pipes and went to bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day when he was up (at about two o'clock?he had slept
 late), Rodolphe had a basket of apricots picked. He put his letter at the
 bottom under some vine leaves, and at once ordered Girard, his ploughman,
 to take it with care to Madame Bovary. He made use of this means for
 corresponding with her, sending according to the season fruits or game.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If she asks after me," he said, "you will tell her that I have gone on a
 journey. You must give the basket to her herself, into her own hands. Get
 along and take care!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Girard put on his new blouse, knotted his handkerchief round the apricots,
 and walking with great heavy steps in his thick iron-bound galoshes, made
 his way to Yonville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary, when he got to her house, was arranging a bundle of linen
 on the kitchen-table with Felicite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here," said the ploughboy, "is something for you?from the master."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was seized with apprehension, and as she sought in her pocket for some
 coppers, she looked at the peasant with haggard eyes, while he himself
 looked at her with amazement, not understanding how such a present could
 so move anyone. At last he went out. Felicite remained. She could bear it
 no longer; she ran into the sitting room as if to take the apricots there,
 overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found the letter, opened it,
 and, as if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room
 terrified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles was there; she saw him; he spoke to her; she heard nothing, and
 she went on quickly up the stairs, breathless, distraught, dumb, and ever
 holding this horrible piece of paper, that crackled between her fingers
 like a plate of sheet-iron. On the second floor she stopped before the
 attic door, which was closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she tried to calm herself; she recalled the letter; she must finish
 it; she did not dare to. And where? How? She would be seen! "Ah, no!
 here," she thought, "I shall be all right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma pushed open the door and went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The slates threw straight down a heavy heat that gripped her temples,
 stifled her; she dragged herself to the closed garret-window. She drew
 back the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Opposite, beyond the roofs, stretched the open country till it was lost to
 sight. Down below, underneath her, the village square was empty; the
 stones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks on the houses were
 motionless. At the corner of the street, from a lower storey, rose a kind
 of humming with strident modulations. It was Binet turning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She leant against the embrasure of the window, and reread the letter with
 angry sneers. But the more she fixed her attention upon it, the more
 confused were her ideas. She saw him again, heard him, encircled him with
 her arms, and throbs of her heart, that beat against her breast like blows
 of a sledge-hammer, grew faster and faster, with uneven intervals. She
 looked about her with the wish that the earth might crumble into pieces.
 Why not end it all? What restrained her? She was free. She advanced,
 looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself, "Come! come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight of her
 body towards the abyss. It seemed to her that the ground of the
 oscillating square went up the walls and that the floor dipped on end like
 a tossing boat. She was right at the edge, almost hanging, surrounded by
 vast space. The blue of the heavens suffused her, the air was whirling in
 her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself be taken; and the
 humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Emma! Emma!" cried Charles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stopped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wherever are you? Come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thought that she had just escaped from death almost made her faint
 with terror. She closed her eyes; then she shivered at the touch of a hand
 on her sleeve; it was Felicite.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Master is waiting for you, madame; the soup is on the table."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she had to go down to sit at table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She tried to eat. The food choked her. Then she unfolded her napkin as if
 to examine the darns, and she really thought of applying herself to this
 work, counting the threads in the linen. Suddenly the remembrance of the
 letter returned to her. How had she lost it? Where could she find it? But
 she felt such weariness of spirit that she could not even invent a pretext
 for leaving the table. Then she became a coward; she was afraid of
 Charles; he knew all, that was certain! Indeed he pronounced these words
 in a strange manner:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are not likely to see Monsieur Rodolphe soon again, it seems."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told you?" she said, shuddering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told me!" he replied, rather astonished at her abrupt tone. "Why,
 Girard, whom I met just now at the door of the Cafe Francais. He has gone
 on a journey, or is to go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gave a sob.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What surprises you in that? He absents himself like that from time to
 time for a change, and, ma foi, I think he's right, when one has a fortune
 and is a bachelor. Besides, he has jolly times, has our friend. He's a bit
 of a rake. Monsieur Langlois told me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped for propriety's sake because the servant came in. She put back
 into the basket the apricots scattered on the sideboard. Charles, without
 noticing his wife's colour, had them brought to him, took one, and bit
 into it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! perfect!" said he; "just taste!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he handed her the basket, which she put away from her gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do just smell! What an odour!" he remarked, passing it under her nose
 several times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am choking," she cried, leaping up. But by an effort of will the spasm
 passed; then?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is nothing," she said, "it is nothing! It is nervousness. Sit down and
 go on eating." For she dreaded lest he should begin questioning her,
 attending to her, that she should not be left alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, to obey her, sat down again, and he spat the stones of the
 apricots into his hands, afterwards putting them on his plate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly a blue tilbury passed across the square at a rapid trot. Emma
 uttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, Rodolphe, after many reflections, had decided to set out for
 Rouen. Now, as from La Huchette to Buchy there is no other way than by
 Yonville, he had to go through the village, and Emma had recognised him by
 the rays of the lanterns, which like lightning flashed through the
 twilight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran thither. The
 table with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and
 cruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for help;
 Berthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was
 unlacing her mistress, whose whole body shivered convulsively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll run to my laboratory for some aromatic vinegar," said the druggist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then as she opened her eyes on smelling the bottle?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was sure of it," he remarked; "that would wake any dead person for
 you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Speak to us," said Charles; "collect yourself; it is your Charles, who
 loves you. Do you know me? See! here is your little girl! Oh, kiss her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The child stretched out her arms to her mother to cling to her neck. But
 turning away her head, Emma said in a broken voice "No, no! no one!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fainted again. They carried her to her bed. She lay there stretched at
 full length, her lips apart, her eyelids closed, her hands open,
 motionless, and white as a waxen image. Two streams of tears flowed from
 her eyes and fell slowly upon the pillow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the chemist, near
 him, maintained that meditative silence that is becoming on the serious
 occasions of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not be uneasy," he said, touching his elbow; "I think the paroxysm is
 past."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, she is resting a little now," answered Charles, watching her sleep.
 "Poor girl! poor girl! She had gone off now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Homais asked how the accident had come about. Charles answered that
 she had been taken ill suddenly while she was eating some apricots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Extraordinary!" continued the chemist. "But it might be that the apricots
 had brought on the syncope. Some natures are so sensitive to certain
 smells; and it would even be a very fine question to study both in its
 pathological and physiological relation. The priests know the importance
 of it, they who have introduced aromatics into all their ceremonies. It is
 to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies?a thing, moreover,
 very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more delicate than the
 other. Some are cited who faint at the smell of burnt hartshorn, of new
 bread?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take care; you'll wake her!" said Bovary in a low voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And not only," the druggist went on, "are human beings subject to such
 anomalies, but animals also. Thus you are not ignorant of the singularly
 aphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria, vulgarly called
 catmint, on the feline race; and, on the other hand, to quote an example
 whose authenticity I can answer for. Bridaux (one of my old comrades, at
 present established in the Rue Malpalu) possesses a dog that falls into
 convulsions as soon as you hold out a snuff-box to him. He often even
 makes the experiment before his friends at his summer-house at Guillaume
 Wood. Would anyone believe that a simple sternutation could produce such
 ravages on a quadrupedal organism? It is extremely curious, is it not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Charles, who was not listening to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This shows us," went on the other, smiling with benign self-sufficiency,
 "the innumerable irregularities of the nervous system. With regard to
 madame, she has always seemed to me, I confess, very susceptible. And so I
 should by no means recommend to you, my dear friend, any of those
 so-called remedies that, under the pretence of attacking the symptoms,
 attack the constitution. No; no useless physicking! Diet, that is all;
 sedatives, emollients, dulcification. Then, don't you think that perhaps
 her imagination should be worked upon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In what way? How?" said Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! that is it. Such is indeed the question. 'That is the question,' as I
 lately read in a newspaper."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Emma, awaking, cried out?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The letter! the letter!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight. Brain-fever had
 set in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his
 patients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling her pulse,
 putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as
 Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again. He
 called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his
 old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was
 Emma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even
 seem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting together after
 all their troubles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 About the middle of October she could sit up in bed supported by pillows.
 Charles wept when he saw her eat her first bread-and-jelly. Her strength
 returned to her; she got up for a few hours of an afternoon, and one day,
 when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk
 round the garden. The sand of the paths was disappearing beneath the dead
 leaves; she walked slowly, dragging along her slippers, and leaning
 against Charles's shoulder. She smiled all the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They went thus to the bottom of the garden near the terrace. She drew
 herself up slowly, shading her eyes with her hand to look. She looked far
 off, as far as she could, but on the horizon were only great bonfires of
 grass smoking on the hills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will tire yourself, my darling!" said Bovary. And, pushing her gently
 to make her go into the arbour, "Sit down on this seat; you'll be
 comfortable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! no; not there!" she said in a faltering voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was seized with giddiness, and from that evening her illness
 recommenced, with a more uncertain character, it is true, and more complex
 symptoms. Now she suffered in her heart, then in the chest, the head, the
 limbs; she had vomitings, in which Charles thought he saw the first signs
 of cancer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And besides this, the poor fellow was worried about money matters.

 <h2>
 Chapter Fourteen
 </h2>
 <p>
 To begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais for all
 the physic supplied by him, and though, as a medical man, he was not
 obliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a little at such an
 obligation. Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was
 mistress, became terrible. Bills rained in upon the house; the tradesmen
 grumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him. In fact, at the
 height of Emma's illness, the latter, taking advantage of the
 circumstances to make his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak,
 the travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other
 things. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them. The
 tradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered, and
 that he would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her
 convalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he was
 resolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his
 goods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop.
 Felicite forgot; he had other things to attend to; then thought no more
 about them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns
 threatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a bill at
 six months. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea occurred
 to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux. So, with an
 embarrassed air, he asked if it were possible to get them, adding that it
 would be for a year, at any interest he wished. Lheureux ran off to his
 shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill, by which Bovary
 undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September next the sum of one
 thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred and eighty already
 agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus lending at six per
 cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and the things bringing him
 in a good third at the least, this ought in twelve months to give him a
 profit of a hundred and thirty francs. He hoped that the business would
 not stop there; that the bills would not be paid; that they would be
 renewed; and that his poor little money, having thriven at the doctor's as
 at a hospital, would come back to him one day considerably more plump, and
 fat enough to burst his bag.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everything, moreover, succeeded with him. He was adjudicator for a supply
 of cider to the hospital at Neufchatel; Monsieur Guillaumin promised him
 some shares in the turf-pits of Gaumesnil, and he dreamt of establishing a
 new diligence service between Arcueil and Rouen, which no doubt would not
 be long in ruining the ramshackle van of the "Lion d'Or," and that,
 travelling faster, at a cheaper rate, and carrying more luggage, would
 thus put into his hands the whole commerce of Yonville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles several times asked himself by what means he should next year be
 able to pay back so much money. He reflected, imagined expedients, such as
 applying to his father or selling something. But his father would be deaf,
 and he?he had nothing to sell. Then he foresaw such worries that he
 quickly dismissed so disagreeable a subject of meditation from his mind.
 He reproached himself with forgetting Emma, as if, all his thoughts
 belonging to this woman, it was robbing her of something not to be
 constantly thinking of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The winter was severe, Madame Bovary's convalescence slow. When it was
 fine they wheeled her arm-chair to the window that overlooked the square,
 for she now had an antipathy to the garden, and the blinds on that side
 were always down. She wished the horse to be sold; what she formerly liked
 now displeased her. All her ideas seemed to be limited to the care of
 herself. She stayed in bed taking little meals, rang for the servant to
 inquire about her gruel or to chat with her. The snow on the market-roof
 threw a white, still light into the room; then the rain began to fall; and
 Emma waited daily with a mind full of eagerness for the inevitable return
 of some trifling events which nevertheless had no relation to her. The
 most important was the arrival of the "Hirondelle" in the evening. Then
 the landlady shouted out, and other voices answered, while Hippolyte's
 lantern, as he fetched the boxes from the boot, was like a star in the
 darkness. At mid-day Charles came in; then he went out again; next she
 took some beef-tea, and towards five o'clock, as the day drew in, the
 children coming back from school, dragging their wooden shoes along the
 pavement, knocked the clapper of the shutters with their rulers one after
 the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was at this hour that Monsieur Bournisien came to see her. He inquired
 after her health, gave her news, exhorted her to religion, in a coaxing
 little prattle that was not without its charm. The mere thought of his
 cassock comforted her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day, when at the height of her illness, she had thought herself dying,
 and had asked for the communion; and, while they were making the
 preparations in her room for the sacrament, while they were turning the
 night table covered with syrups into an altar, and while Felicite was
 strewing dahlia flowers on the floor, Emma felt some power passing over
 her that freed her from her pains, from all perception, from all feeling.
 Her body, relieved, no longer thought; another life was beginning; it
 seemed to her that her being, mounting toward God, would be annihilated in
 that love like a burning incense that melts into vapour. The bed-clothes
 were sprinkled with holy water, the priest drew from the holy pyx the
 white wafer; and it was fainting with a celestial joy that she put out her
 lips to accept the body of the Saviour presented to her. The curtains of
 the alcove floated gently round her like clouds, and the rays of the two
 tapers burning on the night-table seemed to shine like dazzling halos.
 Then she let her head fall back, fancying she heard in space the music of
 seraphic harps, and perceived in an azure sky, on a golden throne in the
 midst of saints holding green palms, God the Father, resplendent with
 majesty, who with a sign sent to earth angels with wings of fire to carry
 her away in their arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This splendid vision dwelt in her memory as the most beautiful thing that
 it was possible to dream, so that now she strove to recall her sensation.
 That still lasted, however, but in a less exclusive fashion and with a
 deeper sweetness. Her soul, tortured by pride, at length found rest in
 Christian humility, and, tasting the joy of weakness, she saw within
 herself the destruction of her will, that must have left a wide entrance
 for the inroads of heavenly grace. There existed, then, in the place of
 happiness, still greater joys?another love beyond all loves, without
 pause and without end, one that would grow eternally! She saw amid the
 illusions of her hope a state of purity floating above the earth mingling
 with heaven, to which she aspired. She wanted to become a saint. She
 bought chaplets and wore amulets; she wished to have in her room, by the
 side of her bed, a reliquary set in emeralds that she might kiss it every
 evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cure marvelled at this humour, although Emma's religion, he thought,
 might, from its fervour, end by touching on heresy, extravagance. But not
 being much versed in these matters, as soon as they went beyond a certain
 limit he wrote to Monsieur Boulard, bookseller to Monsignor, to send him
 "something good for a lady who was very clever." The bookseller, with as
 much indifference as if he had been sending off hardware to niggers,
 packed up, pellmell, everything that was then the fashion in the pious
 book trade. There were little manuals in questions and answers, pamphlets
 of aggressive tone after the manner of Monsieur de Maistre, and certain
 novels in rose-coloured bindings and with a honied style, manufactured by
 troubadour seminarists or penitent blue-stockings. There were the "Think
 of it; the Man of the World at Mary's Feet, by Monsieur de ***, decorated
 with many Orders"; "The Errors of Voltaire, for the Use of the Young,"
 etc.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary's mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply herself
 seriously to anything; moreover, she began this reading in too much hurry.
 She grew provoked at the doctrines of religion; the arrogance of the
 polemic writings displeased her by their inveteracy in attacking people
 she did not know; and the secular stories, relieved with religion, seemed
 to her written in such ignorance of the world, that they insensibly
 estranged her from the truths for whose proof she was looking.
 Nevertheless, she persevered; and when the volume slipped from her hands,
 she fancied herself seized with the finest Catholic melancholy that an
 ethereal soul could conceive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As for the memory of Rodolphe, she had thrust it back to the bottom of her
 heart, and it remained there more solemn and more motionless than a king's
 mummy in a catacomb. An exhalation escaped from this embalmed love, that,
 penetrating through everything, perfumed with tenderness the immaculate
 atmosphere in which she longed to live. When she knelt on her Gothic
 prie-Dieu, she addressed to the Lord the same suave words that she had
 murmured formerly to her lover in the outpourings of adultery. It was to
 make faith come; but no delights descended from the heavens, and she arose
 with tired limbs and with a vague feeling of a gigantic dupery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This searching after faith, she thought, was only one merit the more, and
 in the pride of her devoutness Emma compared herself to those grand ladies
 of long ago whose glory she, had dreamed of over a portrait of La
 Valliere, and who, trailing with so much majesty the lace-trimmed trains
 of their long gowns, retired into solitudes to shed at the feet of Christ
 all the tears of hearts that life had wounded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she gave herself up to excessive charity. She sewed clothes for the
 poor, she sent wood to women in childbed; and Charles one day, on coming
 home, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen seated at the table
 eating soup. She had her little girl, whom during her illness her husband
 had sent back to the nurse, brought home. She wanted to teach her to read;
 even when Berthe cried, she was not vexed. She had made up her mind to
 resignation, to universal indulgence. Her language about everything was
 full of ideal expressions. She said to her child, "Is your stomach-ache
 better, my angel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary senior found nothing to censure except perhaps this mania of
 knitting jackets for orphans instead of mending her own house-linen; but,
 harassed with domestic quarrels, the good woman took pleasure in this
 quiet house, and she even stayed there till after Easter, to escape the
 sarcasms of old Bovary, who never failed on Good Friday to order
 chitterlings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides the companionship of her mother-in-law, who strengthened her a
 little by the rectitude of her judgment and her grave ways, Emma almost
 every day had other visitors. These were Madame Langlois, Madame Caron,
 Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and regularly from two to five o'clock
 the excellent Madame Homais, who, for her part, had never believed any of
 the tittle-tattle about her neighbour. The little Homais also came to see
 her; Justin accompanied them. He went up with them to her bedroom, and
 remained standing near the door, motionless and mute. Often even Madame
 Bovary; taking no heed of him, began her toilette. She began by taking out
 her comb, shaking her head with a quick movement, and when he for the
 first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her knees unrolling in
 black ringlets, it was to him, poor child! like a sudden entrance into
 something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, no doubt, did not notice his silent attentions or his timidity. She
 had no suspicion that the love vanished from her life was there,
 palpitating by her side, beneath that coarse holland shirt, in that
 youthful heart open to the emanations of her beauty. Besides, she now
 enveloped all things with such indifference, she had words so affectionate
 with looks so haughty, such contradictory ways, that one could no longer
 distinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from virtue. One evening,
 for example, she was angry with the servant, who had asked to go out, and
 stammered as she tried to find some pretext. Then suddenly?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you love him?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was blushing, she
 added, "There! run along; enjoy yourself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the beginning of spring she had the garden turned up from end to end,
 despite Bovary's remonstrances. However, he was glad to see her at last
 manifest a wish of any kind. As she grew stronger she displayed more
 wilfulness. First, she found occasion to expel Mere Rollet, the nurse, who
 during her convalescence had contracted the habit of coming too often to
 the kitchen with her two nurslings and her boarder, better off for teeth
 than a cannibal. Then she got rid of the Homais family, successively
 dismissed all the other visitors, and even frequented church less
 assiduously, to the great approval of the druggist, who said to her in a
 friendly way?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were going in a bit for the cassock!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As formerly, Monsieur Bournisien dropped in every day when he came out
 after catechism class. He preferred staying out of doors to taking the air
 "in the grove," as he called the arbour. This was the time when Charles
 came home. They were hot; some sweet cider was brought out, and they drank
 together to madame's complete restoration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Binet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the terrace
 wall, fishing for crayfish. Bovary invited him to have a drink, and he
 thoroughly understood the uncorking of the stone bottles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must," he said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him, even to
 the very extremity of the landscape, "hold the bottle perpendicularly on
 the table, and after the strings are cut, press up the cork with little
 thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed they do seltzer-water at restaurants."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But during his demonstration the cider often spurted right into their
 faces, and then the ecclesiastic, with a thick laugh, never missed this
 joke?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Its goodness strikes the eye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he was not even scandalised at
 the chemist, who advised Charles to give madame some distraction by taking
 her to the theatre at Rouen to hear the illustrious tenor, Lagardy.
 Homais, surprised at this silence, wanted to know his opinion, and the
 priest declared that he considered music less dangerous for morals than
 literature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the chemist took up the defence of letters. The theatre, he contended,
 served for railing at prejudices, and, beneath a mask of pleasure, taught
 virtue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Castigat ridendo mores,'* Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider the greater
 part of Voltaire's tragedies; they are cleverly strewn with philosophical
 reflections, that made them a vast school of morals and diplomacy for the
 people."
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *It corrects customs through laughter.
</pre>
 <p>
 "I," said Binet, "once saw a piece called the 'Gamin de Paris,' in which
 there was the character of an old general that is really hit off to a T.
 He sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl, who at the
 ending?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly," continued Homais, "there is bad literature as there is bad
 pharmacy, but to condemn in a lump the most important of the fine arts
 seems to me a stupidity, a Gothic idea, worthy of the abominable times
 that imprisoned Galileo."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know very well," objected the cure, "that there are good works, good
 authors. However, if it were only those persons of different sexes united
 in a bewitching apartment, decorated rouge, those lights, those effeminate
 voices, all this must, in the long-run, engender a certain mental
 libertinage, give rise to immodest thoughts and impure temptations. Such,
 at any rate, is the opinion of all the Fathers. Finally," he added,
 suddenly assuming a mystic tone of voice while he rolled a pinch of snuff
 between his fingers, "if the Church has condemned the theatre, she must be
 right; we must submit to her decrees."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," asked the druggist, "should she excommunicate actors? For formerly
 they openly took part in religious ceremonies. Yes, in the middle of the
 chancel they acted; they performed a kind of farce called 'Mysteries,'
 which often offended against the laws of decency."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the chemist
 went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more than one
 piquant detail, matters really libidinous!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And on a gesture of irritation from Monsieur Bournisien?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you'll admit that it is not a book to place in the hands of a young
 girl, and I should be sorry if Athalie?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is the Protestants, and not we," cried the other impatiently, "who
 recommend the Bible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No matter," said Homais. "I am surprised that in our days, in this
 century of enlightenment, anyone should still persist in proscribing an
 intellectual relaxation that is inoffensive, moralising, and sometimes
 even hygienic; is it not, doctor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No doubt," replied the doctor carelessly, either because, sharing the
 same ideas, he wished to offend no one, or else because he had not any
 ideas.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The conversation seemed at an end when the chemist thought fit to shoot a
 Parthian arrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see dancers
 kicking about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come!" said the cure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! I've known some!" And separating the words of his sentence, Homais
 repeated, "I?have?known?some!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they were wrong," said Bournisien, resigned to anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By Jove! they go in for more than that," exclaimed the druggist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir!" replied the ecclesiastic, with such angry eyes that the druggist
 was intimidated by them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I only mean to say," he replied in less brutal a tone, "that toleration
 is the surest way to draw people to religion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is true! that is true!" agreed the good fellow, sitting down again
 on his chair. But he stayed only a few moments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, as soon as he had gone, Monsieur Homais said to the doctor?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what I call a cock-fight. I beat him, did you see, in a way!?Now
 take my advice. Take madame to the theatre, if it were only for once in
 your life, to enrage one of these ravens, hang it! If anyone could take my
 place, I would accompany you myself. Be quick about it. Lagardy is only
 going to give one performance; he's engaged to go to England at a high
 salary. From what I hear, he's a regular dog; he's rolling in money; he's
 taking three mistresses and a cook along with him. All these great artists
 burn the candle at both ends; they require a dissolute life, that suits
 the imagination to some extent. But they die at the hospital, because they
 haven't the sense when young to lay by. Well, a pleasant dinner! Goodbye
 till to-morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he at
 once communicated it to his wife, who at first refused, alleging the
 fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give
 in, so sure was he that this recreation would be good for her. He saw
 nothing to prevent it: his mother had sent them three hundred francs which
 he had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large, and the
 falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that there was no need
 to think about them. Besides, imagining that she was refusing from
 delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of worrying her she at
 last made up her mind, and the next day at eight o'clock they set out in
 the "Hirondelle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who thought
 himself bound not to budge from it, sighed as he saw them go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, a pleasant journey!" he said to them; "happy mortals that you are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown with
 four flounces?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are as lovely as a Venus. You'll cut a figure at Rouen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The diligence stopped at the "Croix-Rouge" in the Place Beauvoisine. It
 was the inn that is in every provincial faubourg, with large stables and
 small bedrooms, where one sees in the middle of the court chickens
 pilfering the oats under the muddy gigs of the commercial travellers?a
 good old house, with worm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on winter
 nights, always full of people, noise, and feeding, whose black tables are
 sticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow by the flies,
 the damp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that always smells of the
 village, like ploughboys dressed in Sundayclothes, has a cafe on the
 street, and towards the countryside a kitchen-garden. Charles at once set
 out. He muddled up the stage-boxes with the gallery, the pit with the
 boxes; asked for explanations, did not understand them; was sent from the
 box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the inn, returned to the
 theatre, and thus several times traversed the whole length of the town
 from the theatre to the boulevard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. The doctor was much
 afraid of missing the beginning, and, without having had time to swallow a
 plate of soup, they presented themselves at the doors of the theatre,
 which were still closed.

 <h2>
 Chapter Fifteen
 </h2>
 <p>
 The crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed between the
 balustrades. At the corner of the neighbouring streets huge bills repeated
 in quaint letters "Lucie de Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc." The weather was
 fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the curls, and
 handkerchiefs taken from pockets were mopping red foreheads; and now and
 then a warm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the border of the
 tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses. A little lower
 down, however, one was refreshed by a current of icy air that smelt of
 tallow, leather, and oil. This was an exhalation from the Rue des
 Charrettes, full of large black warehouses where they made casks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a
 little stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept his tickets in his
 hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he pressed against his stomach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her heart began to beat as soon as she reached the vestibule. She
 involuntarily smiled with vanity on seeing the crowd rushing to the right
 by the other corridor while she went up the staircase to the reserved
 seats. She was as pleased as a child to push with her finger the large
 tapestried door. She breathed in with all her might the dusty smell of the
 lobbies, and when she was seated in her box she bent forward with the air
 of a duchess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The theatre was beginning to fill; opera-glasses were taken from their
 cases, and the subscribers, catching sight of one another, were bowing.
 They came to seek relaxation in the fine arts after the anxieties of
 business; but "business" was not forgotten; they still talked cottons,
 spirits of wine, or indigo. The heads of old men were to be seen,
 inexpressive and peaceful, with their hair and complexions looking like
 silver medals tarnished by steam of lead. The young beaux were strutting
 about in the pit, showing in the opening of their waistcoats their pink or
 applegreen cravats, and Madame Bovary from above admired them leaning on
 their canes with golden knobs in the open palm of their yellow gloves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the
 ceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a sudden gaiety over the
 theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and first there
 was the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins squeaking,
 cornets trumpeting, flutes and flageolets fifing. But three knocks were
 heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass instruments played
 some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a country-scene.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the cross-roads of a wood, with a fountain shaded by an oak to the
 left. Peasants and lords with plaids on their shoulders were singing a
 hunting-song together; then a captain suddenly came on, who evoked the
 spirit of evil by lifting both his arms to heaven. Another appeared; they
 went away, and the hunters started afresh. She felt herself transported to
 the reading of her youth, into the midst of Walter Scott. She seemed to
 hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes re-echoing over the
 heather. Then her remembrance of the novel helping her to understand the
 libretto, she followed the story phrase by phrase, while vague thoughts
 that came back to her dispersed at once again with the bursts of music.
 She gave herself up to the lullaby of the melodies, and felt all her being
 vibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her nerves. She had not eyes
 enough to look at the costumes, the scenery, the actors, the painted trees
 that shook when anyone walked, and the velvet caps, cloaks, swords?all
 those imaginary things that floated amid the harmony as in the atmosphere
 of another world. But a young woman stepped forward, throwing a purse to a
 squire in green. She was left alone, and the flute was heard like the
 murmur of a fountain or the warbling of birds. Lucie attacked her cavatina
 in G major bravely. She plained of love; she longed for wings. Emma, too,
 fleeing from life, would have liked to fly away in an embrace. Suddenly
 Edgar-Lagardy appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty of marble
 to the ardent races of the South. His vigorous form was tightly clad in a
 brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled poniard hung against his left
 thigh, and he cast round laughing looks showing his white teeth. They said
 that a Polish princess having heard him sing one night on the beach at
 Biarritz, where he mended boats, had fallen in love with him. She had
 ruined herself for him. He had deserted her for other women, and this
 sentimental celebrity did not fail to enhance his artistic reputation. The
 diplomatic mummer took care always to slip into his advertisements some
 poetic phrase on the fascination of his person and the susceptibility of
 his soul. A fine organ, imperturbable coolness, more temperament than
 intelligence, more power of emphasis than of real singing, made up the
 charm of this admirable charlatan nature, in which there was something of
 the hairdresser and the toreador.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the first scene he evoked enthusiasm. He pressed Lucy in his arms, he
 left her, he came back, he seemed desperate; he had outbursts of rage,
 then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness, and the notes escaped from
 his bare neck full of sobs and kisses. Emma leant forward to see him,
 clutching the velvet of the box with her nails. She was filling her heart
 with these melodious lamentations that were drawn out to the accompaniment
 of the double-basses, like the cries of the drowning in the tumult of a
 tempest. She recognised all the intoxication and the anguish that had
 almost killed her. The voice of a prima donna seemed to her to be but
 echoes of her conscience, and this illusion that charmed her as some very
 thing of her own life. But no one on earth had loved her with such love.
 He had not wept like Edgar that last moonlit night when they said,
 "To-morrow! to-morrow!" The theatre rang with cheers; they recommenced the
 entire movement; the lovers spoke of the flowers on their tomb, of vows,
 exile, fate, hopes; and when they uttered the final adieu, Emma gave a
 sharp cry that mingled with the vibrations of the last chords.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why," asked Bovary, "does that gentleman persecute her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no!" she answered; "he is her lover!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet he vows vengeance on her family, while the other one who came on
 before said, 'I love Lucie and she loves me!' Besides, he went off with
 her father arm in arm. For he certainly is her father, isn't he?the
 ugly little man with a cock's feather in his hat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Despite Emma's explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began in which
 Gilbert lays bare his abominable machinations to his master Ashton,
 Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to deceive Lucie, thought it
 was a love-gift sent by Edgar. He confessed, moreover, that he did not
 understand the story because of the music, which interfered very much with
 the words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does it matter?" said Emma. "Do be quiet!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but you know," he went on, leaning against her shoulder, "I like to
 understand things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be quiet! be quiet!" she cried impatiently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange blossoms
 in her hair, and paler than the white satin of her gown. Emma dreamed of
 her marriage day; she saw herself at home again amid the corn in the
 little path as they walked to the church. Oh, why had not she, like this
 woman, resisted, implored? She, on the contrary, had been joyous, without
 seeing the abyss into which she was throwing herself. Ah! if in the
 freshness of her beauty, before the soiling of marriage and the
 disillusions of adultery, she could have anchored her life upon some
 great, strong heart, then virtue, tenderness, voluptuousness, and duty
 blending, she would never have fallen from so high a happiness. But that
 happiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair of all desire. She
 now knew the smallness of the passions that art exaggerated. So, striving
 to divert her thoughts, Emma determined now to see in this reproduction of
 her sorrows only a plastic fantasy, well enough to please the eye, and she
 even smiled internally with disdainful pity when at the back of the stage
 under the velvet hangings a man appeared in a black cloak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he made, and immediately the
 instruments and the singers began the sextet. Edgar, flashing with fury,
 dominated all the others with his clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal
 provocations at him in deep notes; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint, Arthur
 at one side, his modulated tones in the middle register, and the bass of
 the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the women
 repeating his words took them up in chorus delightfully. They were all in
 a row gesticulating, and anger, vengeance, jealousy, terror, and
 stupefaction breathed forth at once from their half-opened mouths. The
 outraged lover brandished his naked sword; his guipure ruffle rose with
 jerks to the movements of his chest, and he walked from right to left with
 long strides, clanking against the boards the silver-gilt spurs of his
 soft boots, widening out at the ankles. He, she thought must have an
 inexhaustible love to lavish it upon the crowd with such effusion. All her
 small fault-findings faded before the poetry of the part that absorbed
 her; and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the character, she
 tried to imagine to herself his life?that life resonant,
 extraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers if fate had willed
 it. They would have known one another, loved one another. With him,
 through all the kingdoms of Europe she would have travelled from capital
 to capital, sharing his fatigues and his pride, picking up the flowers
 thrown to him, herself embroidering his costumes. Then each evening, at
 the back of a box, behind the golden trellis-work she would have drunk in
 eagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung for her alone;
 from the stage, even as he acted, he would have looked at her. But the mad
 idea seized her that he was looking at her; it was certain. She longed to
 run to his arms, to take refuge in his strength, as in the incarnation of
 love itself, and to say to him, to cry out, "Take me away! carry me with
 you! let us go! Thine, thine! all my ardour and all my dreams!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The curtain fell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving of the
 fans, made the air more suffocating. Emma wanted to go out; the crowd
 filled the corridors, and she fell back in her arm-chair with palpitations
 that choked her. Charles, fearing that she would faint, ran to the
 refreshment-room to get a glass of barley-water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had great difficulty in getting back to his seat, for his elbows were
 jerked at every step because of the glass he held in his hands, and he
 even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short
 sleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running down to her loins, uttered
 cries like a peacock, as if she were being assassinated. Her husband, who
 was a millowner, railed at the clumsy fellow, and while she was with her
 handkerchief wiping up the stains from her handsome cherry-coloured
 taffeta gown, he angrily muttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement.
 At last Charles reached his wife, saying to her, quite out of breath?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ma foi! I thought I should have had to stay there. There is such a crowd?SUCH
 a crowd!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He added?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just guess whom I met up there! Monsieur Leon!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Himself! He's coming along to pay his respects." And as he finished these
 words the ex-clerk of Yonville entered the box.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He held out his hand with the ease of a gentleman; and Madame Bovary
 extended hers, without doubt obeying the attraction of a stronger will.
 She had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell upon the
 green leaves, and they had said good-bye standing at the window. But soon
 recalling herself to the necessities of the situation, with an effort she
 shook off the torpor of her memories, and began stammering a few hurried
 words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, good-day! What! you here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Silence!" cried a voice from the pit, for the third act was beginning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you are at Rouen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And since when?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Turn them out! turn them out!" People were looking at them. They were
 silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the guests,
 the scene between Ashton and his servant, the grand duet in D major, all
 were for her as far off as if the instruments had grown less sonorous and
 the characters more remote. She remembered the games at cards at the
 druggist's, and the walk to the nurse's, the reading in the arbour, the
 tete-a-tete by the fireside?all that poor love, so calm and so
 protracted, so discreet, so tender, and that she had nevertheless
 forgotten. And why had he come back? What combination of circumstances had
 brought him back into her life? He was standing behind her, leaning with
 his shoulder against the wall of the box; now and again she felt herself
 shuddering beneath the hot breath from his nostrils falling upon her hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does this amuse you?" said he, bending over her so closely that the end
 of his moustache brushed her cheek. She replied carelessly?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dear me, no, not much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he proposed that they should leave the theatre and go and take an ice
 somewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, not yet; let us stay," said Bovary. "Her hair's undone; this is going
 to be tragic."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of the
 singer seemed to her exaggerated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She screams too loud," said she, turning to Charles, who was listening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?a little," he replied, undecided between the frankness of his
 pleasure and his respect for his wife's opinion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then with a sigh Leon said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The heat is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Unbearable! Yes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you feel unwell?" asked Bovary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am stifling; let us go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Monsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her shoulders, and
 all three went off to sit down in the harbour, in the open air, outside
 the windows of a cafe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First they spoke of her illness, although Emma interrupted Charles from
 time to time, for fear, she said, of boring Monsieur Leon; and the latter
 told them that he had come to spend two years at Rouen in a large office,
 in order to get practice in his profession, which was different in
 Normandy and Paris. Then he inquired after Berthe, the Homais, Mere
 Lefrancois, and as they had, in the husband's presence, nothing more to
 say to one another, the conversation soon came to an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 People coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or
 shouting at the top of their voices, "O bel ange, ma Lucie!*" Then Leon,
 playing the dilettante, began to talk music. He had seen Tambourini,
 Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his
 grand outbursts, was nowhere.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> *Oh beautiful angel, my Lucie.
</pre>
 <p>
 "Yet," interrupted Charles, who was slowly sipping his rum-sherbet, "they
 say that he is quite admirable in the last act. I regret leaving before
 the end, because it was beginning to amuse me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why," said the clerk, "he will soon give another performance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Charles replied that they were going back next day. "Unless," he
 added, turning to his wife, "you would like to stay alone, kitten?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And changing his tactics at this unexpected opportunity that presented
 itself to his hopes, the young man sang the praises of Lagardy in the last
 number. It was really superb, sublime. Then Charles insisted?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would get back on Sunday. Come, make up your mind. You are wrong if
 you feel that this is doing you the least good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and stood
 discreetly near them. Charles, who understood, took out his purse; the
 clerk held back his arm, and did not forget to leave two more pieces of
 silver that he made chink on the marble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am really sorry," said Bovary, "about the money which you are?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other made a careless gesture full of cordiality, and taking his hat
 said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is settled, isn't it? To-morrow at six o'clock?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles explained once more that he could not absent himself longer, but
 that nothing prevented Emma?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," she stammered, with a strange smile, "I am not sure?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you must think it over. We'll see. Night brings counsel." Then to
 Leon, who was walking along with them, "Now that you are in our part of
 the world, I hope you'll come and ask us for some dinner now and then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clerk declared he would not fail to do so, being obliged, moreover, to
 go to Yonville on some business for his office. And they parted before the
 Saint-Herbland Passage just as the clock in the cathedral struck half-past
 eleven.

 <h2>
 Chapter One
 </h2>
 <p>
 Monsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the
 dancing-rooms, where he was even a great success amongst the grisettes,
 who thought he had a distinguished air. He was the best-mannered of the
 students; he wore his hair neither too long nor too short, didn't spend
 all his quarter's money on the first day of the month, and kept on good
 terms with his professors. As for excesses, he had always abstained from
 them, as much from cowardice as from refinement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Often when he stayed in his room to read, or else when sitting of an
 evening under the lime-trees of the Luxembourg, he let his Code fall to
 the ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him. But gradually this
 feeling grew weaker, and other desires gathered over it, although it still
 persisted through them all. For Leon did not lose all hope; there was for
 him, as it were, a vague promise floating in the future, like a golden
 fruit suspended from some fantastic tree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, seeing her again after three years of absence his passion
 reawakened. He must, he thought, at last make up his mind to possess her.
 Moreover, his timidity had worn off by contact with his gay companions,
 and he returned to the provinces despising everyone who had not with
 varnished shoes trodden the asphalt of the boulevards. By the side of a
 Parisienne in her laces, in the drawing-room of some illustrious
 physician, a person driving his carriage and wearing many orders, the poor
 clerk would no doubt have trembled like a child; but here, at Rouen, on
 the harbour, with the wife of this small doctor he felt at his ease, sure
 beforehand he would shine. Self-possession depends on its environment. We
 don't speak on the first floor as on the fourth; and the wealthy woman
 seems to have, about her, to guard her virtue, all her banknotes, like a
 cuirass in the lining of her corset.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On leaving the Bovarys the night before, Leon had followed them through
 the streets at a distance; then having seen them stop at the
 "Croix-Rouge," he turned on his heel, and spent the night meditating a
 plan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the next day about five o'clock he walked into the kitchen of the inn,
 with a choking sensation in his throat, pale cheeks, and that resolution
 of cowards that stops at nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The gentleman isn't in," answered a servant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This seemed to him a good omen. He went upstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was not disturbed at his approach; on the contrary, she apologised for
 having neglected to tell him where they were staying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I divined it!" said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pretended he had been guided towards her by chance, by, instinct. She
 began to smile; and at once, to repair his folly, Leon told her that he
 had spent his morning in looking for her in all the hotels in the town one
 after the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you have made up your mind to stay?" he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she said, "and I am wrong. One ought not to accustom oneself to
 impossible pleasures when there are a thousand demands upon one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I can imagine!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! no; for you, you are a man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But men too had had their trials, and the conversation went off into
 certain philosophical reflections. Emma expatiated much on the misery of
 earthly affections, and the eternal isolation in which the heart remains
 entombed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To show off, or from a naive imitation of this melancholy which called
 forth his, the young man declared that he had been awfully bored during
 the whole course of his studies. The law irritated him, other vocations
 attracted him, and his mother never ceased worrying him in every one of
 her letters. As they talked they explained more and more fully the motives
 of their sadness, working themselves up in their progressive confidence.
 But they sometimes stopped short of the complete exposition of their
 thought, and then sought to invent a phrase that might express it all the
 same. She did not confess her passion for another; he did not say that he
 had forgotten her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps he no longer remembered his suppers with girls after masked balls;
 and no doubt she did not recollect the rendezvous of old when she ran
 across the fields in the morning to her lover's house. The noises of the
 town hardly reached them, and the room seemed small, as if on purpose to
 hem in their solitude more closely. Emma, in a dimity dressing-gown, leant
 her head against the back of the old arm-chair; the yellow wall-paper
 formed, as it were, a golden background behind her, and her bare head was
 mirrored in the glass with the white parting in the middle, and the tip of
 her ears peeping out from the folds of her hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But pardon me!" she said. "It is wrong of me. I weary you with my eternal
 complaints."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, never, never!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you knew," she went on, raising to the ceiling her beautiful eyes, in
 which a tear was trembling, "all that I had dreamed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I! Oh, I too have suffered! Often I went out; I went away. I dragged
 myself along the quays, seeking distraction amid the din of the crowd
 without being able to banish the heaviness that weighed upon me. In an
 engraver's shop on the boulevard there is an Italian print of one of the
 Muses. She is draped in a tunic, and she is looking at the moon, with
 forget-me-nots in her flowing hair. Something drove me there continually;
 I stayed there hours together." Then in a trembling voice, "She resembled
 you a little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary turned away her head that he might not see the irrepressible
 smile she felt rising to her lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Often," he went on, "I wrote you letters that I tore up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not answer. He continued?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. I thought I
 recognised you at street-corners, and I ran after all the carriages
 through whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil like yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed resolved to let him go on speaking without interruption.
 Crossing her arms and bending down her face, she looked at the rosettes on
 her slippers, and at intervals made little movements inside the satin of
 them with her toes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last she sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the most wretched thing, is it not?is to drag out, as I do, a
 useless existence. If our pains were only of some use to someone, we
 should find consolation in the thought of the sacrifice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He started off in praise of virtue, duty, and silent immolation, having
 himself an incredible longing for self-sacrifice that he could not
 satisfy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should much like," she said, "to be a nurse at a hospital."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere any calling?unless
 perhaps that of a doctor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With a slight shrug of her shoulders, Emma interrupted him to speak of her
 illness, which had almost killed her. What a pity! She should not be
 suffering now! Leon at once envied the calm of the tomb, and one evening
 he had even made his will, asking to be buried in that beautiful rug with
 velvet stripes he had received from her. For this was how they would have
 wished to be, each setting up an ideal to which they were now adapting
 their past life. Besides, speech is a rolling-mill that always thins out
 the sentiment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But at this invention of the rug she asked, "But why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" He hesitated. "Because I loved you so!" And congratulating himself
 at having surmounted the difficulty, Leon watched her face out of the
 corner of his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across. The mass
 of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted from her blue eyes;
 her whole face shone. He waited. At last she replied?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I always suspected it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then they went over all the trifling events of that far-off existence,
 whose joys and sorrows they had just summed up in one word. They recalled
 the arbour with clematis, the dresses she had worn, the furniture of her
 room, the whole of her house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And our poor cactuses, where are they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The cold killed them this winter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! how I have thought of them, do you know? I often saw them again as of
 yore, when on the summer mornings the sun beat down upon your blinds, and
 I saw your two bare arms passing out amongst the flowers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor friend!" she said, holding out her hand to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon swiftly pressed his lips to it. Then, when he had taken a deep breath?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible force that
 took captive my life. Once, for instance, I went to see you; but you, no
 doubt, do not remember it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do," she said; "go on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on the
 last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue flowers; and without
 any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you. Every
 moment, however, I grew more and more conscious of my folly, and I went on
 walking by you, not daring to follow you completely, and unwilling to
 leave you. When you went into a shop, I waited in the street, and I
 watched you through the window taking off your gloves and counting the
 change on the counter. Then you rang at Madame Tuvache's; you were let in,
 and I stood like an idiot in front of the great heavy door that had closed
 after you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary, as she listened to him, wondered that she was so old. All
 these things reappearing before her seemed to widen out her life; it was
 like some sentimental immensity to which she returned; and from time to
 time she said in a low voice, her eyes half closed?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it is true?true?true!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They heard eight strike on the different clocks of the Beauvoisine
 quarter, which is full of schools, churches, and large empty hotels. They
 no longer spoke, but they felt as they looked upon each other a buzzing in
 their heads, as if something sonorous had escaped from the fixed eyes of
 each of them. They were hand in hand now, and the past, the future,
 reminiscences and dreams, all were confounded in the sweetness of this
 ecstasy. Night was darkening over the walls, on which still shone, half
 hidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills representing four
 scenes from the "Tour de Nesle," with a motto in Spanish and French at the
 bottom. Through the sash-window a patch of dark sky was seen between the
 pointed roofs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose to light two wax-candles on the drawers, then she sat down again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was thinking how to resume the interrupted conversation, when she said
 to him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How is it that no one until now has ever expressed such sentiments to
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The clerk said that ideal natures were difficult to understand. He from
 the first moment had loved her, and he despaired when he thought of the
 happiness that would have been theirs, if thanks to fortune, meeting her
 earlier, they had been indissolubly bound to one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have sometimes thought of it," she went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a dream!" murmured Leon. And fingering gently the blue binding of
 her long white sash, he added, "And who prevents us from beginning now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my friend," she replied; "I am too old; you are too young. Forget me!
 Others will love you; you will love them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not as you!" he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a child you are! Come, let us be sensible. I wish it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She showed him the impossibility of their love, and that they must remain,
 as formerly, on the simple terms of a fraternal friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Was she speaking thus seriously? No doubt Emma did not herself know, quite
 absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction, and the necessity of
 defending herself from it; and contemplating the young man with a moved
 look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his trembling hands
 attempted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! forgive me!" he cried, drawing back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous to her
 than the boldness of Rodolphe when he advanced to her open-armed. No man
 had ever seemed to her so beautiful. An exquisite candour emanated from
 his being. He lowered his long fine eyelashes, that curled upwards. His
 cheek, with the soft skin reddened, she thought, with desire of her
 person, and Emma felt an invincible longing to press her lips to it. Then,
 leaning towards the clock as if to see the time?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! how late it is!" she said; "how we do chatter!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He understood the hint and took up his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It has even made me forget the theatre. And poor Bovary has left me here
 especially for that. Monsieur Lormeaux, of the Rue Grand-Pont, was to take
 me and his wife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the opportunity was lost, as she was to leave the next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really!" said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I must see you again," he went on. "I wanted to tell you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Something?important?serious. Oh, no! Besides, you will not
 go; it is impossible. If you should?listen to me. Then you have not
 understood me; you have not guessed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet you speak plainly," said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you can jest. Enough! enough! Oh, for pity's sake, let me see you
 once?only once!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" She stopped; then, as if thinking better of it, "Oh, not
 here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where you will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you?" She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, "To-morrow at
 eleven o'clock in the cathedral."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall be there," he cried, seizing her hands, which she disengaged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And as they were both standing up, he behind her, and Emma with her head
 bent, he stooped over her and pressed long kisses on her neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are mad! Ah! you are mad!" she said, with sounding little laughs,
 while the kisses multiplied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the consent of
 her eyes. They fell upon him full of an icy dignity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon stepped back to go out. He stopped on the threshold; then he
 whispered with a trembling voice, "Tomorrow!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She answered with a nod, and disappeared like a bird into the next room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in which she
 cancelled the rendezvous; all was over; they must not, for the sake of
 their happiness, meet again. But when the letter was finished, as she did
 not know Leon's address, she was puzzled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll give it to him myself," she said; "he will come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony, Leon
 himself varnished his pumps with several coatings. He put on white
 trousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent he had into his
 handkerchief, then having had his hair curled, he uncurled it again, in
 order to give it a more natural elegance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is still too early," he thought, looking at the hairdresser's
 cuckoo-clock, that pointed to the hour of nine. He read an old fashion
 journal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three streets, thought it was
 time, and went slowly towards the porch of Notre Dame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the jeweller's
 windows, and the light falling obliquely on the cathedral made mirrors of
 the corners of the grey stones; a flock of birds fluttered in the grey sky
 round the trefoil bell-turrets; the square, resounding with cries, was
 fragrant with the flowers that bordered its pavement, roses, jasmines,
 pinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly spaced out between moist
 grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds; the fountains gurgled in
 the centre, and under large umbrellas, amidst melons, piled up in heaps,
 flower-women, bare-headed, were twisting paper round bunches of violets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young man took one. It was the first time that he had bought flowers
 for a woman, and his breast, as he smelt them, swelled with pride, as if
 this homage that he meant for another had recoiled upon himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he was afraid of being seen; he resolutely entered the church. The
 beadle, who was just then standing on the threshold in the middle of the
 left doorway, under the "Dancing Marianne," with feather cap, and rapier
 dangling against his calves, came in, more majestic than a cardinal, and
 as shining as a saint on a holy pyx.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came towards Leon, and, with that smile of wheedling benignity assumed
 by ecclesiastics when they question children?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The gentleman, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? The gentleman
 would like to see the curiosities of the church?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" said the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to look at the
 Place. Emma was not coming yet. He went up again to the choir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the arches
 and some portions of the glass windows. But the reflections of the
 paintings, broken by the marble rim, were continued farther on upon the
 flag-stones, like a many-coloured carpet. The broad daylight from without
 streamed into the church in three enormous rays from the three opened
 portals. From time to time at the upper end a sacristan passed, making the
 oblique genuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal lustres hung
 motionless. In the choir a silver lamp was burning, and from the side
 chapels and dark places of the church sometimes rose sounds like sighs,
 with the clang of a closing grating, its echo reverberating under the
 lofty vault.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon with solemn steps walked along by the walls. Life had never seemed so
 good to him. She would come directly, charming, agitated, looking back at
 the glances that followed her, and with her flounced dress, her gold
 eyeglass, her thin shoes, with all sorts of elegant trifles that he had
 never enjoyed, and with the ineffable seduction of yielding virtue. The
 church like a huge boudoir spread around her; the arches bent down to
 gather in the shade the confession of her love; the windows shone
 resplendent to illumine her face, and the censers would burn that she
 might appear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she did not come. He sat down on a chair, and his eyes fell upon a
 blue stained window representing boatmen carrying baskets. He looked at it
 long, attentively, and he counted the scales of the fishes and the
 button-holes of the doublets, while his thoughts wandered off towards
 Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The beadle, standing aloof, was inwardly angry at this individual who took
 the liberty of admiring the cathedral by himself. He seemed to him to be
 conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to be robbing him in a sort,
 and almost committing sacrilege.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined cloak?it
 was she! Leon rose and ran to meet her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma was pale. She walked fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Read!" she said, holding out a paper to him. "Oh, no!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she abruptly withdrew her hand to enter the chapel of the Virgin,
 where, kneeling on a chair, she began to pray.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he nevertheless
 experienced a certain charm in seeing her, in the middle of a rendezvous,
 thus lost in her devotions, like an Andalusian marchioness; then he grew
 bored, for she seemed never coming to an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma prayed, or rather strove to pray, hoping that some sudden resolution
 might descend to her from heaven; and to draw down divine aid she filled
 full her eyes with the splendours of the tabernacle. She breathed in the
 perfumes of the full-blown flowers in the large vases, and listened to the
 stillness of the church, that only heightened the tumult of her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came forward,
 hurriedly saying?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? Madame would like to
 see the curiosities of the church?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no!" cried the clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?" said she. For she clung with her expiring virtue to the Virgin,
 the sculptures, the tombs?anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, in order to proceed "by rule," the beadle conducted them right to
 the entrance near the square, where, pointing out with his cane a large
 circle of block-stones without inscription or carving?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This," he said majestically, "is the circumference of the beautiful bell
 of Ambroise. It weighed forty thousand pounds. There was not its equal in
 all Europe. The workman who cast it died of the joy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us go on," said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old fellow started off again; then, having got back to the chapel of
 the Virgin, he stretched forth his arm with an all-embracing gesture of
 demonstration, and, prouder than a country squire showing you his
 espaliers, went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This simple stone covers Pierre de Breze, lord of Varenne and of Brissac,
 grand marshal of Poitou, and governor of Normandy, who died at the battle
 of Montlhery on the 16th of July, 1465."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon bit his lips, fuming.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And on the right, this gentleman all encased in iron, on the prancing
 horse, is his grandson, Louis de Breze, lord of Breval and of Montchauvet,
 Count de Maulevrier, Baron de Mauny, chamberlain to the king, Knight of
 the Order, and also governor of Normandy; died on the 23rd of July, 1531?a
 Sunday, as the inscription specifies; and below, this figure, about to
 descend into the tomb, portrays the same person. It is not possible, is
 it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Bovary put up her eyeglasses. Leon, motionless, looked at her, no
 longer even attempting to speak a single word, to make a gesture, so
 discouraged was he at this two-fold obstinacy of gossip and indifference.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The everlasting guide went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Near him, this kneeling woman who weeps is his spouse, Diane de Poitiers,
 Countess de Breze, Duchess de Valentinois, born in 1499, died in 1566, and
 to the left, the one with the child is the Holy Virgin. Now turn to this
 side; here are the tombs of the Ambroise. They were both cardinals and
 archbishops of Rouen. That one was minister under Louis XII. He did a
 great deal for the cathedral. In his will he left thirty thousand gold
 crowns for the poor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel full of
 balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block that certainly
 might once have been an ill-made statue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Truly," he said with a groan, "it adorned the tomb of Richard Coeur de
 Lion, King of England and Duke of Normandy. It was the Calvinists, sir,
 who reduced it to this condition. They had buried it for spite in the
 earth, under the episcopal seat of Monsignor. See! this is the door by
 which Monsignor passes to his house. Let us pass on quickly to see the
 gargoyle windows."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Leon hastily took some silver from his pocket and seized Emma's arm.
 The beadle stood dumfounded, not able to understand this untimely
 munificence when there were still so many things for the stranger to see.
 So calling him back, he cried?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir! sir! The steeple! the steeple!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you!" said Leon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are wrong, sir! It is four hundred and forty feet high, nine less
 than the great pyramid of Egypt. It is all cast; it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon was fleeing, for it seemed to him that his love, that for nearly two
 hours now had become petrified in the church like the stones, would vanish
 like a vapour through that sort of truncated funnel, of oblong cage, of
 open chimney that rises so grotesquely from the cathedral like the
 extravagant attempt of some fantastic brazier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But where are we going?" she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Making no answer, he walked on with a rapid step; and Madame Bovary was
 already, dipping her finger in the holy water when behind them they heard
 a panting breath interrupted by the regular sound of a cane. Leon turned
 back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he recognised the beadle, holding under his arms and balancing against
 his stomach some twenty large sewn volumes. They were works "which treated
 of the cathedral."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Idiot!" growled Leon, rushing out of the church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A lad was playing about the close.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go and get me a cab!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The child bounded off like a ball by the Rue Quatre-Vents; then they were
 alone a few minutes, face to face, and a little embarrassed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Leon! Really?I don't know?if I ought," she whispered.
 Then with a more serious air, "Do you know, it is very improper?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How so?" replied the clerk. "It is done at Paris."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And that, as an irresistible argument, decided her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still the cab did not come. Leon was afraid she might go back into the
 church. At last the cab appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At all events, go out by the north porch," cried the beadle, who was left
 alone on the threshold, "so as to see the Resurrection, the Last Judgment,
 Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where to, sir?" asked the coachman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where you like," said Leon, forcing Emma into the cab.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the lumbering machine set out. It went down the Rue Grand-Pont,
 crossed the Place des Arts, the Quai Napoleon, the Pont Neuf, and stopped
 short before the statue of Pierre Corneille.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go on," cried a voice that came from within.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour Lafayette,
 set off down-hill, and entered the station at a gallop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, straight on!" cried the same voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours, trotted
 quietly beneath the elm-trees. The coachman wiped his brow, put his
 leather hat between his knees, and drove his carriage beyond the side
 alley by the meadow to the margin of the waters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It went along by the river, along the towing-path paved with sharp
 pebbles, and for a long while in the direction of Oyssel, beyond the
 isles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares, Sotteville, La
 Grande-Chaussee, the Rue d'Elbeuf, and made its third halt in front of the
 Jardin des Plantes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get on, will you?" cried the voice more furiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the Quai'des
 Curandiers, the Quai aux Meules, once more over the bridge, by the Place
 du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital gardens, where old men in black
 coats were walking in the sun along the terrace all green with ivy. It
 went up the Boulevard Bouvreuil, along the Boulevard Cauchoise, then the
 whole of Mont-Riboudet to the Deville hills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction, wandered
 about at hazard. The cab was seen at Saint-Pol, at Lescure, at Mont
 Gargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du Gaillardbois; in the Rue
 Maladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before Saint-Romain, Saint-Vivien,
 Saint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise?in front of the Customs, at the "Vieille
 Tour," the "Trois Pipes," and the Monumental Cemetery. From time to time
 the coachman, on his box cast despairing eyes at the public-houses. He
 could not understand what furious desire for locomotion urged these
 individuals never to wish to stop. He tried to now and then, and at once
 exclamations of anger burst forth behind him. Then he lashed his
 perspiring jades afresh, but indifferent to their jolting, running up
 against things here and there, not caring if he did, demoralised, and
 almost weeping with thirst, fatigue, and depression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the
 streets, at the corners, the good folk opened large wonder-stricken eyes
 at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces, a cab with blinds drawn,
 and which appeared thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb, and
 tossing about like a vessel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the sun beat
 most fiercely against the old plated lanterns, a bared hand passed beneath
 the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps of paper that
 scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white butterflies on a
 field of red clover all in bloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At about six o'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the
 Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her veil down,
 and without turning her head.

 <h2>
 Chapter Two
 </h2>
 <p>
 On reaching the inn, Madame Bovary was surprised not to see the diligence.
 Hivert, who had waited for her fifty-three minutes, had at last started.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet nothing forced her to go; but she had given her word that she would
 return that same evening. Moreover, Charles expected her, and in her heart
 she felt already that cowardly docility that is for some women at once the
 chastisement and atonement of adultery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She packed her box quickly, paid her bill, took a cab in the yard,
 hurrying on the driver, urging him on, every moment inquiring about the
 time and the miles traversed. He succeeded in catching up the "Hirondelle"
 as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hardly was she seated in her corner than she closed her eyes, and opened
 them at the foot of the hill, when from afar she recognised Felicite, who
 was on the lookout in front of the farrier's shop. Hivert pulled in his
 horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said mysteriously?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madame, you must go at once to Monsieur Homais. It's for something
 important."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The village was silent as usual. At the corner of the streets were small
 pink heaps that smoked in the air, for this was the time for jam-making,
 and everyone at Yonville prepared his supply on the same day. But in front
 of the chemist's shop one might admire a far larger heap, and that
 surpassed the others with the superiority that a laboratory must have over
 ordinary stores, a general need over individual fancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She went in. The large arm-chair was upset, and even the "Fanal de Rouen"
 lay on the ground, outspread between two pestles. She pushed open the
 lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen, amid brown jars full of
 picked currants, of powdered sugar and lump sugar, of the scales on the
 table, and of the pans on the fire, she saw all the Homais, small and
 large, with aprons reaching to their chins, and with forks in their hands.
 Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was screaming?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it? What is the matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" replied the druggist. "We are making preserves; they are
 simmering; but they were about to boil over, because there is too much
 juice, and I ordered another pan. Then he, from indolence, from laziness,
 went and took, hanging on its nail in my laboratory, the key of the
 Capharnaum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of the
 utensils and the goods of his trade. He often spent long hours there
 alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he looked upon it not
 as a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there afterwards
 issued, elaborated by his hands, all sorts of pills, boluses, infusions,
 lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his celebrity. No one
 in the world set foot there, and he respected it so, that he swept it
 himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers, was the spot where
 he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge where, egoistically
 concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the exercise of his
 predilections, so that Justin's thoughtlessness seemed to him a monstrous
 piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants, he repeated?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, from the Capharnaum! The key that locks up the acids and caustic
 alkalies! To go and get a spare pan! a pan with a lid! and that I shall
 perhaps never use! Everything is of importance in the delicate operations
 of our art! But, devil take it! one must make distinctions, and not employ
 for almost domestic purposes that which is meant for pharmaceutical! It is
 as if one were to carve a fowl with a scalpel; as if a magistrate?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now be calm," said Madame Homais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Athalie, pulling at his coat, cried "Papa! papa!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, let me alone," went on the druggist "let me alone, hang it! My word!
 One might as well set up for a grocer. That's it! go it! respect nothing!
 break, smash, let loose the leeches, burn the mallow-paste, pickle the
 gherkins in the window jars, tear up the bandages!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought you had?" said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Presently! Do you know to what you exposed yourself? Didn't you see
 anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf? Speak, answer,
 articulate something."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?don't?know," stammered the young fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! you don't know! Well, then, I do know! You saw a bottle of blue
 glass, sealed with yellow wax, that contains a white powder, on which I
 have even written 'Dangerous!' And do you know what is in it? Arsenic! And
 you go and touch it! You take a pan that was next to it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Next to it!" cried Madame Homais, clasping her hands. "Arsenic! You might
 have poisoned us all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And the children began howling as if they already had frightful pains in
 their entrails.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or poison a patient!" continued the druggist. "Do you want to see me in
 the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice? To see me
 dragged to the scaffold? Don't you know what care I take in managing
 things, although I am so thoroughly used to it? Often I am horrified
 myself when I think of my responsibility; for the Government persecutes
 us, and the absurd legislation that rules us is a veritable Damocles'
 sword over our heads."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her for, and the
 druggist went on in breathless phrases?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is your return for all the kindness we have shown you! That is how
 you recompense me for the really paternal care that I lavish on you! For
 without me where would you be? What would you be doing? Who provides you
 with food, education, clothes, and all the means of figuring one day with
 honour in the ranks of society? But you must pull hard at the oar if
 you're to do that, and get, as, people say, callosities upon your hands.
 Fabricando fit faber, age quod agis.*"
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> * The worker lives by working, do what he will.
</pre>
 <p>
 He was so exasperated he quoted Latin. He would have quoted Chinese or
 Greenlandish had he known those two languages, for he was in one of those
 crises in which the whole soul shows indistinctly what it contains, like
 the ocean, which, in the storm, opens itself from the seaweeds on its
 shores down to the sands of its abysses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am beginning to repent terribly of having taken you up! I should
 certainly have done better to have left you to rot in your poverty and the
 dirt in which you were born. Oh, you'll never be fit for anything but to
 herd animals with horns! You have no aptitude for science! You hardly know
 how to stick on a label! And there you are, dwelling with me snug as a
 parson, living in clover, taking your ease!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Emma, turning to Madame Homais, "I was told to come here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, dear me!" interrupted the good woman, with a sad air, "how am I to
 tell you? It is a misfortune!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She could not finish, the druggist was thundering?"Empty it! Clean
 it! Take it back! Be quick!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And seizing Justin by the collar of his blouse, he shook a book out of his
 pocket. The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker, and, having picked up
 the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "CONJUGAL?LOVE!" he said, slowly separating the two words. "Ah! very
 good! very good! very pretty! And illustrations! Oh, this is too much!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Madame Homais came forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, do not touch it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The children wanted to look at the pictures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave the room," he said imperiously; and they went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand, rolling his
 eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic. Then he came straight to his pupil, and,
 planting himself in front of him with crossed arms?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you every vice, then, little wretch? Take care! you are on a
 downward path. Did not you reflect that this infamous book might fall in
 the hands of my children, kindle a spark in their minds, tarnish the
 purity of Athalie, corrupt Napoleon. He is already formed like a man. Are
 you quite sure, anyhow, that they have not read it? Can you certify to me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But really, sir," said Emma, "you wished to tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes! madame. Your father-in-law is dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before suddenly
 from an attack of apoplexy as he got up from table, and by way of greater
 precaution, on account of Emma's sensibility, Charles had begged Homais to
 break the horrible news to her gradually. Homais had thought over his
 speech; he had rounded, polished it, made it rhythmical; it was a
 masterpiece of prudence and transitions, of subtle turns and delicacy; but
 anger had got the better of rhetoric.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma, giving up all chance of hearing any details, left the pharmacy; for
 Monsieur Homais had taken up the thread of his vituperations. However, he
 was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal tone whilst he
 fanned himself with his skull-cap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is not that I entirely disapprove of the work. Its author was a
 doctor! There are certain scientific points in it that it is not ill a man
 should know, and I would even venture to say that a man must know. But
 later?later! At any rate, not till you are man yourself and your
 temperament is formed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her, came
 forward with open arms and said to her with tears in his voice?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my dear!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he bent over her gently to kiss her. But at the contact of his lips
 the memory of the other seized her, and she passed her hand over her face
 shuddering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she made answer, "Yes, I know, I know!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He showed her the letter in which his mother told the event without any
 sentimental hypocrisy. She only regretted her husband had not received the
 consolations of religion, as he had died at Daudeville, in the street, at
 the door of a cafe after a patriotic dinner with some ex-officers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma gave him back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance's sake, she
 affected a certain repugnance. But as he urged her to try, she resolutely
 began eating, while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a dejected
 attitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of distress.
 Once he sighed, "I should have liked to see him again!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was silent. At last, understanding that she must say something, "How
 old was your father?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fifty-eight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And that was all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A quarter of an hour after he added, "My poor mother! what will become of
 her now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She made a gesture that signified she did not know. Seeing her so
 taciturn, Charles imagined her much affected, and forced himself to say
 nothing, not to reawaken this sorrow which moved him. And, shaking off his
 own?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the cloth was removed, Bovary did not rise, nor did Emma; and as she
 looked at him, the monotony of the spectacle drove little by little all
 pity from her heart. He seemed to her paltry, weak, a cipher?in a
 word, a poor thing in every way. How to get rid of him? What an
 interminable evening! Something stupefying like the fumes of opium seized
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They heard in the passage the sharp noise of a wooden leg on the boards.
 It was Hippolyte bringing back Emma's luggage. In order to put it down he
 described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He doesn't even remember any more about it," she thought, looking at the
 poor devil, whose coarse red hair was wet with perspiration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bovary was searching at the bottom of his purse for a centime, and without
 appearing to understand all there was of humiliation for him in the mere
 presence of this man, who stood there like a personified reproach to his
 incurable incapacity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hallo! you've a pretty bouquet," he said, noticing Leon's violets on the
 chimney.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she replied indifferently; "it's a bouquet I bought just now from a
 beggar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with tears,
 against them, smelt them delicately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day Madame Bovary senior arrived. She and her son wept much.
 Emma, on the pretext of giving orders, disappeared. The following day they
 had a talk over the mourning. They went and sat down with their workboxes
 by the waterside under the arbour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles was thinking of his father, and was surprised to feel so much
 affection for this man, whom till then he had thought he cared little
 about. Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her husband. The worst days of
 the past seemed enviable to her. All was forgotten beneath the instinctive
 regret of such a long habit, and from time to time whilst she sewed, a big
 tear rolled along her nose and hung suspended there a moment. Emma was
 thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since they had been
 together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and not having eyes
 enough to gaze upon each other. She tried to recall the slightest details
 of that past day. But the presence of her husband and mother-in-law
 worried her. She would have liked to hear nothing, to see nothing, so as
 not to disturb the meditation on her love, that, do what she would, became
 lost in external sensations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were scattered
 around her. Madame Bovary senior was plying her scissor without looking
 up, and Charles, in his list slippers and his old brown surtout that he
 used as a dressing-gown, sat with both hands in his pockets, and did not
 speak either; near them Berthe, in a little white pinafore, was raking
 sand in the walks with her spade. Suddenly she saw Monsieur Lheureux, the
 linendraper, come in through the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came to offer his services "under the sad circumstances." Emma answered
 that she thought she could do without. The shopkeeper was not to be
 beaten.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beg your pardon," he said, "but I should like to have a private talk
 with you." Then in a low voice, "It's about that affair?you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Charles crimsoned to his ears. "Oh, yes! certainly." And in his confusion,
 turning to his wife, "Couldn't you, my darling?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed to understand him, for she rose; and Charles said to his
 mother, "It is nothing particular. No doubt, some household trifle." He
 did not want her to know the story of the bill, fearing her reproaches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently clear terms
 began to congratulate Emma on the inheritance, then to talk of indifferent
 matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest, and of his own health, which
 was always so-so, always having ups and downs. In fact, he had to work
 devilish hard, although he didn't make enough, in spite of all people
 said, to find butter for his bread.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma let him talk on. She had bored herself so prodigiously the last two
 days.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And so you're quite well again?" he went on. "Ma foi! I saw your husband
 in a sad state. He's a good fellow, though we did have a little
 misunderstanding."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She asked what misunderstanding, for Charles had said nothing of the
 dispute about the goods supplied to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you know well enough," cried Lheureux. "It was about your little
 fancies?the travelling trunks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had drawn his hat over his eyes, and, with his hands behind his back,
 smiling and whistling, he looked straight at her in an unbearable manner.
 Did he suspect anything?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was lost in all kinds of apprehensions. At last, however, he went on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We made it up, all the same, and I've come again to propose another
 arrangement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was to renew the bill Bovary had signed. The doctor, of course, would
 do as he pleased; he was not to trouble himself, especially just now, when
 he would have a lot of worry. "And he would do better to give it over to
 someone else?to you, for example. With a power of attorney it could
 be easily managed, and then we (you and I) would have our little business
 transactions together."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not understand. He was silent. Then, passing to his trade,
 Lheureux declared that madame must require something. He would send her a
 black barege, twelve yards, just enough to make a gown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The one you've on is good enough for the house, but you want another for
 calls. I saw that the very moment that I came in. I've the eye of an
 American!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not send the stuff; he brought it. Then he came again to measure
 it; he came again on other pretexts, always trying to make himself
 agreeable, useful, "enfeoffing himself," as Homais would have said, and
 always dropping some hint to Emma about the power of attorney. He never
 mentioned the bill; she did not think of it. Charles, at the beginning of
 her convalescence, had certainly said something about it to her, but so
 many emotions had passed through her head that she no longer remembered
 it. Besides, she took care not to talk of any money questions. Madame
 Bovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed the change in her ways to
 the religious sentiments she had contracted during her illness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as soon as she was gone, Emma greatly astounded Bovary by her
 practical good sense. It would be necessary to make inquiries, to look
 into mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a sale by auction
 or a liquidation. She quoted technical terms casually, pronounced the
 grand words of order, the future, foresight, and constantly exaggerated
 the difficulties of settling his father's affairs so much, that at last
 one day she showed him the rough draft of a power of attorney to manage
 and administer his business, arrange all loans, sign and endorse all
 bills, pay all sums, etc. She had profited by Lheureux's lessons. Charles
 naively asked her where this paper came from.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Monsieur Guillaumin"; and with the utmost coolness she added, "I don't
 trust him overmuch. Notaries have such a bad reputation. Perhaps we ought
 to consult?we only know?no one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Unless Leon?" replied Charles, who was reflecting. But it was
 difficult to explain matters by letter. Then she offered to make the
 journey, but he thanked her. She insisted. It was quite a contest of
 mutual consideration. At last she cried with affected waywardness?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I will go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How good you are!" he said, kissing her forehead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning she set out in the "Hirondelle" to go to Rouen to consult
 Monsieur Leon, and she stayed there three days.

 <h2>
 Chapter Three
 </h2>
 <p>
 They were three full, exquisite days?a true honeymoon. They were at
 the Hotel-de-Boulogne, on the harbour; and they lived there, with drawn
 blinds and closed doors, with flowers on the floor, and iced syrups were
 brought them early in the morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Towards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the
 islands. It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the
 caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels. The smoke of the
 tar rose up between the trees; there were large fatty drops on the water,
 undulating in the purple colour of the sun, like floating plaques of
 Florentine bronze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They rowed down in the midst of moored boats, whose long oblique cables
 grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat. The din of the town
 gradually grew distant; the rolling of carriages, the tumult of voices,
 the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels. She took off her bonnet, and
 they landed on their island.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose door hung
 black nets. They ate fried smelts, cream and cherries. They lay down upon
 the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and they would fain, like two
 Robinsons, have lived for ever in this little place, which seemed to them
 in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth. It was not the first
 time that they had seen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that they had heard
 the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves; but, no doubt, they
 had never admired all this, as if Nature had not existed before, or had
 only begun to be beautiful since the gratification of their desires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At night they returned. The boat glided along the shores of the islands.
 They sat at the bottom, both hidden by the shade, in silence. The square
 oars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the stillness, seemed to mark time,
 like the beating of a metronome, while at the stern the rudder that
 trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once the moon rose; they did not fail to make fine phrases, finding the
 orb melancholy and full of poetry. She even began to sing?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One night, do you remember, we were sailing," etc.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the winds
 carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings
 about him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was opposite him, leaning against the partition of the shallop,
 through one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in. Her black dress,
 whose drapery spread out like a fan, made her seem more slender, taller.
 Her head was raised, her hands clasped, her eyes turned towards heaven. At
 times the shadow of the willows hid her completely; then she reappeared
 suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon, on the floor by her side, found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet
 silk. The boatman looked at it, and at last said?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day. A lot of jolly
 folk, gentlemen and ladies, with cakes, champagne, cornets?everything
 in style! There was one especially, a tall handsome man with small
 moustaches, who was that funny! And they all kept saying, 'Now tell us
 something, Adolphe?Dolpe,' I think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shivered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are in pain?" asked Leon, coming closer to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it's nothing! No doubt, it is only the night air."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And who doesn't want for women, either," softly added the sailor,
 thinking he was paying the stranger a compliment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, spitting on his hands, he took the oars again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet they had to part. The adieux were sad. He was to send his letters to
 Mere Rollet, and she gave him such precise instructions about a double
 envelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you can assure me it is all right?" she said with her last kiss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why," he thought afterwards as he came back through the streets
 alone, "is she so very anxious to get this power of attorney?"

 <h2>
 Chapter Four
 </h2>
 <p>
 Leon soon put on an air of superiority before his comrades, avoided their
 company, and completely neglected his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited for her letters; he re-read them; he wrote to her. He called her
 to mind with all the strength of his desires and of his memories. Instead
 of lessening with absence, this longing to see her again grew, so that at
 last on Saturday morning he escaped from his office.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When, from the summit of the hill, he saw in the valley below the
 church-spire with its tin flag swinging in the wind, he felt that delight
 mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness that millionaires
 must experience when they come back to their native village.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went rambling round her house. A light was burning in the kitchen. He
 watched for her shadow behind the curtains, but nothing appeared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations. She thought
 he "had grown and was thinner," while Artemise, on the contrary, thought
 him stouter and darker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the
 tax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for the "Hirondelle," had
 definitely put forward his meal one hour, and now he dined punctually at
 five, and yet he declared usually the rickety old concern "was late."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon, however, made up his mind, and knocked at the doctor's door. Madame
 was in her room, and did not come down for a quarter of an hour. The
 doctor seemed delighted to see him, but he never stirred out that evening,
 nor all the next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw her alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in the lane;
 in the lane, as she had the other one! It was a stormy night, and they
 talked under an umbrella by lightning flashes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their separation was becoming intolerable. "I would rather die!" said
 Emma. She was writhing in his arms, weeping. "Adieu! adieu! When shall I
 see you again?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that she
 promised him to find soon, by no matter what means, a regular opportunity
 for seeing one another in freedom at least once a week. Emma never doubted
 she should be able to do this. Besides, she was full of hope. Some money
 was coming to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the strength of it she bought a pair of yellow curtains with large
 stripes for her room, whose cheapness Monsieur Lheureux had commended; she
 dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux, declaring that it wasn't
 "drinking the sea," politely undertook to supply her with one. She could
 no longer do without his services. Twenty times a day she sent for him,
 and he at once put by his business without a murmur. People could not
 understand either why Mere Rollet breakfasted with her every day, and even
 paid her private visits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter, that she
 seemed seized with great musical fervour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening when Charles was listening to her, she began the same piece
 four times over, each time with much vexation, while he, not noticing any
 difference, cried?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bravo! very goodl You are wrong to stop. Go on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no; it is execrable! My fingers are quite rusty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day he begged her to play him something again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well; to please you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Charles confessed she had gone off a little. She played wrong notes
 and blundered; then, stopping short?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! it is no use. I ought to take some lessons; but?" She bit her
 lips and added, "Twenty francs a lesson, that's too dear!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, so it is?rather," said Charles, giggling stupidly. "But it
 seems to me that one might be able to do it for less; for there are
 artists of no reputation, and who are often better than the celebrities."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Find them!" said Emma.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day when he came home he looked at her shyly, and at last could
 no longer keep back the words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How obstinate you are sometimes! I went to Barfucheres to-day. Well,
 Madame Liegard assured me that her three young ladies who are at La
 Misericorde have lessons at fifty sous apiece, and that from an excellent
 mistress!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shrugged her shoulders and did not open her piano again. But when she
 passed by it (if Bovary were there), she sighed?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! my poor piano!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And when anyone came to see her, she did not fail to inform them she had
 given up music, and could not begin again now for important reasons. Then
 people commiserated her?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a pity! she had so much talent!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They even spoke to Bovary about it. They put him to shame, and especially
 the chemist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are wrong. One should never let any of the faculties of nature lie
 fallow. Besides, just think, my good friend, that by inducing madame to
 study; you are economising on the subsequent musical education of your
 child. For my own part, I think that mothers ought themselves to instruct
 their children. That is an idea of Rousseau's, still rather new perhaps,
 but that will end by triumphing, I am certain of it, like mothers nursing
 their own children and vaccination."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Charles returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma replied
 bitterly that it would be better to sell it. This poor piano, that had
 given her vanity so much satisfaction?to see it go was to Bovary
 like the indefinable suicide of a part of herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you liked," he said, "a lesson from time to time, that wouldn't after
 all be very ruinous."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But lessons," she replied, "are only of use when followed up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And thus it was she set about obtaining her husband's permission to go to
 town once a week to see her lover. At the end of a month she was even
 considered to have made considerable progress.

 Chapter Five
 </h2>
 <p>
 She went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order not to
 awaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her getting ready too
 early. Next she walked up and down, went to the windows, and looked out at
 the Place. The early dawn was broadening between the pillars of the
 market, and the chemist's shop, with the shutters still up, showed in the
 pale light of the dawn the large letters of his signboard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to the "Lion
 d'Or," whose door Artemise opened yawning. The girl then made up the coals
 covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in the kitchen. Now and
 again she went out. Hivert was leisurely harnessing his horses, listening,
 moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head and nightcap through a
 grating, was charging him with commissions and giving him explanations
 that would have confused anyone else. Emma kept beating the soles of her
 boots against the pavement of the yard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, when he had eaten his soup, put on his cloak, lighted his pipe,
 and grasped his whip, he calmly installed himself on his seat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The "Hirondelle" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped here
 and there to pick up passengers who waited for it, standing at the border
 of the road, in front of their yard gates.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting; some even
 were still in bed in their houses. Hivert called, shouted, swore; then he
 got down from his seat and went and knocked loudly at the doors. The wind
 blew through the cracked windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows of
 apple-trees followed one upon another, and the road between its two long
 ditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly narrowing towards the
 horizon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Emma knew it from end to end; she knew that after a meadow there was a
 sign-post, next an elm, a barn, or the hut of a lime-kiln tender.
 Sometimes even, in the hope of getting some surprise, she shut her eyes,
 but she never lost the clear perception of the distance to be traversed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last the brick houses began to follow one another more closely, the
 earth resounded beneath the wheels, the "Hirondelle" glided between the
 gardens, where through an opening one saw statues, a periwinkle plant,
 clipped yews, and a swing. Then on a sudden the town appeared. Sloping
 down like an amphitheatre, and drowned in the fog, it widened out beyond
 the bridges confusedly. Then the open country spread away with a
 monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of the
 pale sky. Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable as a
 picture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river curved
 round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in shape, lay on
 the water, like large, motionless, black fishes. The factory chimneys
 belched forth immense brown fumes that were blown away at the top. One
 heard the rumbling of the foundries, together with the clear chimes of the
 churches that stood out in the mist. The leafless trees on the boulevards
 made violet thickets in the midst of the houses, and the roofs, all
 shining with the rain, threw back unequal reflections, according to the
 height of the quarters in which they were. Sometimes a gust of wind drove
 the clouds towards the Saint Catherine hills, like aerial waves that broke
 silently against a cliff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A giddiness seemed to her to detach itself from this mass of existence,
 and her heart swelled as if the hundred and twenty thousand souls that
 palpitated there had all at once sent into it the vapour of the passions
 she fancied theirs. Her love grew in the presence of this vastness, and
 expanded with tumult to the vague murmurings that rose towards her. She
 poured it out upon the square, on the walks, on the streets, and the old
 Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital, as a Babylon
 into which she was entering. She leant with both hands against the window,
 drinking in the breeze; the three horses galloped, the stones grated in
 the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert, from afar, hailed the carts on
 the road, while the bourgeois who had spent the night at the Guillaume
 woods came quietly down the hill in their little family carriages.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on other
 gloves, rearranged her shawl, and some twenty paces farther she got down
 from the "Hirondelle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The town was then awakening. Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the
 shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals
 uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with downcast
 eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered
 black veil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For fear of being seen, she did not usually take the most direct road. She
 plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom of the
 Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there. It, is the quarter for
 theatres, public-houses, and whores. Often a cart would pass near her,
 bearing some shaking scenery. Waiters in aprons were sprinkling sand on
 the flagstones between green shrubs. It all smelt of absinthe, cigars, and
 oysters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that
 escaped from beneath his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Leon walked along the pavement. She followed him to the hotel. He went up,
 opened the door, entered?What an embrace!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, after the kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each other the
 sorrows of the week, the presentiments, the anxiety for the letters; but
 now everything was forgotten; they gazed into each other's faces with
 voluptuous laughs, and tender names.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bed was large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The curtains were
 in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much
 towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so lovely as
 her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour,
 when, with a movement of shame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face
 in her hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The warm room, with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and its calm
 light, seemed made for the intimacies of passion. The curtain-rods, ending
 in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great balls of the fire-dogs shone
 suddenly when the sun came in. On the chimney between the candelabra there
 were two of those pink shells in which one hears the murmur of the sea if
 one holds them to the ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its rather faded
 splendour! They always found the furniture in the same place, and
 sometimes hairpins, that she had forgotten the Thursday bef
