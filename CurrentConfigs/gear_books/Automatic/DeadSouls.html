 PREPARER'S NOTE
 </h2>
 <p>
 The book this was typed from contains a complete Part I, and a partial
 Part II, as it seems only part of Part II survived the adventures
 described in the introduction. Where the text notes that pages are missing
 from the "original", this refers to the Russian original, not the
 translation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the foreign words were italicised in the original, a style not
 preserved here. Accents and diphthongs have also been left out.

 INTRODUCTION
 </h2>
 <p>
 Dead Souls, first published in 1842, is the great prose classic of Russia.
 That amazing institution, "the Russian novel," not only began its career
 with this unfinished masterpiece by Nikolai Vasil'evich Gogol, but
 practically all the Russian masterpieces that have come since have grown
 out of it, like the limbs of a single tree. Dostoieffsky goes so far as to
 bestow this tribute upon an earlier work by the same author, a short story
 entitled The Cloak; this idea has been wittily expressed by another
 compatriot, who says: "We have all issued out of Gogol's Cloak."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dead Souls, which bears the word "Poem" upon the title page of the
 original, has been generally compared to Don Quixote and to the Pickwick
 Papers, while E. M. Vogue places its author somewhere between Cervantes
 and Le Sage. However considerable the influences of Cervantes and Dickens
 may have been?the first in the matter of structure, the other in
 background, humour, and detail of characterisation?the predominating
 and distinguishing quality of the work is undeniably something foreign to
 both and quite peculiar to itself; something which, for want of a better
 term, might be called the quality of the Russian soul. The English reader
 familiar with the works of Dostoieffsky, Turgenev, and Tolstoi, need
 hardly be told what this implies; it might be defined in the words of the
 French critic just named as "a tendency to pity." One might indeed go
 further and say that it implies a certain tolerance of one's characters
 even though they be, in the conventional sense, knaves, products, as the
 case might be, of conditions or circumstance, which after all is the thing
 to be criticised and not the man. But pity and tolerance are rare in
 satire, even in clash with it, producing in the result a deep sense of
 tragic humour. It is this that makes of Dead Souls a unique work,
 peculiarly Gogolian, peculiarly Russian, and distinct from its author's
 Spanish and English masters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still more profound are the contradictions to be seen in the author's
 personal character; and unfortunately they prevented him from completing
 his work. The trouble is that he made his art out of life, and when in his
 final years he carried his struggle, as Tolstoi did later, back into life,
 he repented of all he had written, and in the frenzy of a wakeful night
 burned all his manuscripts, including the second part of Dead Souls, only
 fragments of which were saved. There was yet a third part to be written.
 Indeed, the second part had been written and burned twice. Accounts differ
 as to why he had burned it finally. Religious remorse, fury at adverse
 criticism, and despair at not reaching ideal perfection are among the
 reasons given. Again it is said that he had destroyed the manuscript with
 the others inadvertently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The poet Pushkin, who said of Gogol that "behind his laughter you feel the
 unseen tears," was his chief friend and inspirer. It was he who suggested
 the plot of Dead Souls as well as the plot of the earlier work The
 Revisor, which is almost the only comedy in Russian. The importance of
 both is their introduction of the social element in Russian literature, as
 Prince Kropotkin points out. Both hold up the mirror to Russian
 officialdom and the effects it has produced on the national character. The
 plot of Dead Souls is simple enough, and is said to have been suggested by
 an actual episode.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the day of serfdom in Russia, and a man's standing was often judged
 by the numbers of "souls" he possessed. There was a periodical census of
 serfs, say once every ten or twenty years. This being the case, an owner
 had to pay a tax on every "soul" registered at the last census, though
 some of the serfs might have died in the meantime. Nevertheless, the
 system had its material advantages, inasmuch as an owner might borrow
 money from a bank on the "dead souls" no less than on the living ones. The
 plan of Chichikov, Gogol's hero-villain, was therefore to make a journey
 through Russia and buy up the "dead souls," at reduced rates of course,
 saving their owners the government tax, and acquiring for himself a list
 of fictitious serfs, which he meant to mortgage to a bank for a
 considerable sum. With this money he would buy an estate and some real
 life serfs, and make the beginning of a fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Obviously, this plot, which is really no plot at all but merely a ruse to
 enable Chichikov to go across Russia in a troika, with Selifan the
 coachman as a sort of Russian Sancho Panza, gives Gogol a magnificent
 opportunity to reveal his genius as a painter of Russian panorama, peopled
 with characteristic native types commonplace enough but drawn in comic
 relief. "The comic," explained the author yet at the beginning of his
 career, "is hidden everywhere, only living in the midst of it we are not
 conscious of it; but if the artist brings it into his art, on the stage
 say, we shall roll about with laughter and only wonder we did not notice
 it before." But the comic in Dead Souls is merely external. Let us see how
 Pushkin, who loved to laugh, regarded the work. As Gogol read it aloud to
 him from the manuscript the poet grew more and more gloomy and at last
 cried out: "God! What a sad country Russia is!" And later he said of it:
 "Gogol invents nothing; it is the simple truth, the terrible truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The work on one hand was received as nothing less than an exposure of all
 Russia?what would foreigners think of it? The liberal elements,
 however, the critical Belinsky among them, welcomed it as a revelation, as
 an omen of a freer future. Gogol, who had meant to do a service to Russia
 and not to heap ridicule upon her, took the criticisms of the Slavophiles
 to heart; and he palliated his critics by promising to bring about in the
 succeeding parts of his novel the redemption of Chichikov and the other
 "knaves and blockheads." But the "Westerner" Belinsky and others of the
 liberal camp were mistrustful. It was about this time (1847) that Gogol
 published his Correspondence with Friends, and aroused a literary
 controversy that is alive to this day. Tolstoi is to be found among his
 apologists.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Opinions as to the actual significance of Gogol's masterpiece differ. Some
 consider the author a realist who has drawn with meticulous detail a
 picture of Russia; others, Merejkovsky among them, see in him a great
 symbolist; the very title Dead Souls is taken to describe the living of
 Russia as well as its dead. Chichikov himself is now generally regarded as
 a universal character. We find an American professor, William Lyon Phelps
 <small>1</small>,
 of Yale, holding the opinion that "no one can travel far in America
 without meeting scores of Chichikovs; indeed, he is an accurate portrait
 of the American promoter, of the successful commercial traveller whose
 success depends entirely not on the real value and usefulness of his
 stock-in-trade, but on his knowledge of human nature and of the persuasive
 power of his tongue." This is also the opinion held by Prince Kropotkin <small>2</small>,
 who says: "Chichikov may buy dead souls, or railway shares, or he may
 collect funds for some charitable institution, or look for a position in a
 bank, but he is an immortal international type; we meet him everywhere; he
 is of all lands and of all times; he but takes different forms to suit the
 requirements of nationality and time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again, the work bears an interesting relation to Gogol himself. A
 romantic, writing of realities, he was appalled at the commonplaces of
 life, at finding no outlet for his love of colour derived from his Cossack
 ancestry. He realised that he had drawn a host of "heroes," "one more
 commonplace than another, that there was not a single palliating
 circumstance, that there was not a single place where the reader might
 find pause to rest and to console himself, and that when he had finished
 the book it was as though he had walked out of an oppressive cellar into
 the open air." He felt perhaps inward need to redeem Chichikov; in
 Merejkovsky's opinion he really wanted to save his own soul, but had
 succeeded only in losing it. His last years were spent morbidly; he
 suffered torments and ran from place to place like one hunted; but really
 always running from himself. Rome was his favourite refuge, and he
 returned to it again and again. In 1848, he made a pilgrimage to the Holy
 Land, but he could find no peace for his soul. Something of this mood had
 reflected itself even much earlier in the Memoirs of a Madman: "Oh, little
 mother, save your poor son! Look how they are tormenting him.... There's
 no place for him on earth! He's being driven!... Oh, little mother, take
 pity on thy poor child."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the contradictions of Gogol's character are not to be disposed of in a
 brief essay. Such a strange combination of the tragic and the comic was
 truly seldom seen in one man. He, for one, realised that "it is dangerous
 to jest with laughter." "Everything that I laughed at became sad." "And
 terrible," adds Merejkovsky. But earlier his humour was lighter, less
 tinged with the tragic; in those days Pushkin never failed to be amused by
 what Gogol had brought to read to him. Even Revizor (1835), with its
 tragic undercurrent, was a trifle compared to Dead Souls, so that one is
 not astonished to hear that not only did the Tsar, Nicholas I, give
 permission to have it acted, in spite of its being a criticism of official
 rottenness, but laughed uproariously, and led the applause. Moreover, he
 gave Gogol a grant of money, and asked that its source should not be
 revealed to the author lest "he might feel obliged to write from the
 official point of view."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gogol was born at Sorotchinetz, Little Russia, in March 1809. He left
 college at nineteen and went to St. Petersburg, where he secured a
 position as copying clerk in a government department. He did not keep his
 position long, yet long enough to store away in his mind a number of
 bureaucratic types which proved useful later. He quite suddenly started
 for America with money given to him by his mother for another purpose, but
 when he got as far as Lubeck he turned back. He then wanted to become an
 actor, but his voice proved not strong enough. Later he wrote a poem which
 was unkindly received. As the copies remained unsold, he gathered them all
 up at the various shops and burned them in his room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His next effort, Evenings at the Farm of Dikanka (1831) was more
 successful. It was a series of gay and colourful pictures of Ukraine, the
 land he knew and loved, and if he is occasionally a little over romantic
 here and there, he also achieves some beautifully lyrical passages. Then
 came another even finer series called Mirgorod, which won the admiration
 of Pushkin. Next he planned a "History of Little Russia" and a "History of
 the Middle Ages," this last work to be in eight or nine volumes. The
 result of all this study was a beautiful and short Homeric epic in prose,
 called Taras Bulba. His appointment to a professorship in history was a
 ridiculous episode in his life. After a brilliant first lecture, in which
 he had evidently said all he had to say, he settled to a life of boredom
 for himself and his pupils. When he resigned he said joyously: "I am once
 more a free Cossack." Between 1834 and 1835 he produced a new series of
 stories, including his famous Cloak, which may be regarded as the
 legitimate beginning of the Russian novel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gogol knew little about women, who played an equally minor role in his
 life and in his books. This may be partly because his personal appearance
 was not prepossessing. He is described by a contemporary as "a little man
 with legs too short for his body. He walked crookedly; he was clumsy,
 ill-dressed, and rather ridiculous-looking, with his long lock of hair
 flapping on his forehead, and his large prominent nose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From 1835 Gogol spent almost his entire time abroad; some strange unrest?possibly
 his Cossack blood?possessed him like a demon, and he never stopped
 anywhere very long. After his pilgrimage in 1848 to Jerusalem, he returned
 to Moscow, his entire possessions in a little bag; these consisted of
 pamphlets, critiques, and newspaper articles mostly inimical to himself.
 He wandered about with these from house to house. Everything he had of
 value he gave away to the poor. He ceased work entirely. According to all
 accounts he spent his last days in praying and fasting. Visions came to
 him. His death, which came in 1852, was extremely fantastic. His last
 words, uttered in a loud frenzy, were: "A ladder! Quick, a ladder!" This
 call for a ladder?"a spiritual ladder," in the words of Merejkovsky?had
 been made on an earlier occasion by a certain Russian saint, who used
 almost the same language. "I shall laugh my bitter laugh" <small>3</small>
 was the inscription placed on Gogol's grave.

 <h2>
 AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE FIRST PORTION OF THIS WORK
 </h2>
 <h3>
 Second Edition published in 1846
 </h3>
 <p>
 From the Author to the Reader
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Reader, whosoever or wheresoever you be, and whatsoever be your station?whether
 that of a member of the higher ranks of society or that of a member of the
 plainer walks of life?I beg of you, if God shall have given you any
 skill in letters, and my book shall fall into your hands, to extend to me
 your assistance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For in the book which lies before you, and which, probably, you have read
 in its first edition, there is portrayed a man who is a type taken from
 our Russian Empire. This man travels about the Russian land and meets with
 folk of every condition?from the nobly-born to the humble toiler.
 Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the failings,
 rather than the merits and the virtues, of the commonplace Russian
 individual; and the characters which revolve around him have also been
 selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national weaknesses and
 shortcomings. As for men and women of the better sort, I propose to
 portray them in subsequent volumes. Probably much of what I have described
 is improbable and does not happen as things customarily happen in Russia;
 and the reason for that is that for me to learn all that I have wished to
 do has been impossible, in that human life is not sufficiently long to
 become acquainted with even a hundredth part of what takes place within
 the borders of the Russian Empire. Also, carelessness, inexperience, and
 lack of time have led to my perpetrating numerous errors and inaccuracies
 of detail; with the result that in every line of the book there is
 something which calls for correction. For these reasons I beg of you, my
 reader, to act also as my corrector. Do not despise the task, for, however
 superior be your education, and however lofty your station, and however
 insignificant, in your eyes, my book, and however trifling the apparent
 labour of correcting and commenting upon that book, I implore you to do as
 I have said. And you too, O reader of lowly education and simple status, I
 beseech you not to look upon yourself as too ignorant to be able in some
 fashion, however small, to help me. Every man who has lived in the world
 and mixed with his fellow men will have remarked something which has
 remained hidden from the eyes of others; and therefore I beg of you not to
 deprive me of your comments, seeing that it cannot be that, should you
 read my book with attention, you will have NOTHING to say at some point
 therein.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For example, how excellent it would be if some reader who is sufficiently
 rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be acquainted with the
 sort of characters which I have described herein would annotate in detail
 the book, without missing a single page, and undertake to read it
 precisely as though, laying pen and paper before him, he were first to
 peruse a few pages of the work, and then to recall his own life, and the
 lives of folk with whom he has come in contact, and everything which he
 has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from others, and to proceed to
 annotate, in so far as may tally with his own experience or otherwise,
 what is set forth in the book, and to jot down the whole exactly as it
 stands pictured to his memory, and, lastly, to send me the jottings as
 they may issue from his pen, and to continue doing so until he has covered
 the entire work! Yes, he would indeed do me a vital service! Of style or
 beauty of expression he would need to take no account, for the value of a
 book lies in its truth and its actuality rather than in its wording. Nor
 would he need to consider my feelings if at any point he should feel
 minded to blame or to upbraid me, or to demonstrate the harm rather than
 the good which has been done through any lack of thought or verisimilitude
 of which I have been guilty. In short, for anything and for everything in
 the way of criticism I should be thankful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Also, it would be an excellent thing if some reader in the higher walks of
 life, some person who stands remote, both by life and by education, from
 the circle of folk which I have pictured in my book, but who knows the
 life of the circle in which he himself revolves, would undertake to read
 my work in similar fashion, and methodically to recall to his mind any
 members of superior social classes whom he has met, and carefully to
 observe whether there exists any resemblance between one such class and
 another, and whether, at times, there may not be repeated in a higher
 sphere what is done in a lower, and likewise to note any additional fact
 in the same connection which may occur to him (that is to say, any fact
 pertaining to the higher ranks of society which would seem to confirm or
 to disprove his conclusions), and, lastly, to record that fact as it may
 have occurred within his own experience, while giving full details of
 persons (of individual manners, tendencies, and customs) and also of
 inanimate surroundings (of dress, furniture, fittings of houses, and so
 forth). For I need knowledge of the classes in question, which are the
 flower of our people. In fact, this very reason?the reason that I do
 not yet know Russian life in all its aspects, and in the degree to which
 it is necessary for me to know it in order to become a successful author?is
 what has, until now, prevented me from publishing any subsequent volumes
 of this story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again, it would be an excellent thing if some one who is endowed with the
 faculty of imagining and vividly picturing to himself the various
 situations wherein a character may be placed, and of mentally following up
 a character's career in one field and another?by this I mean some
 one who possesses the power of entering into and developing the ideas of
 the author whose work he may be reading?would scan each character
 herein portrayed, and tell me how each character ought to have acted at a
 given juncture, and what, to judge from the beginnings of each character,
 ought to have become of that character later, and what new circumstances
 might be devised in connection therewith, and what new details might
 advantageously be added to those already described. Honestly can I say
 that to consider these points against the time when a new edition of my
 book may be published in a different and a better form would give me the
 greatest possible pleasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One thing in particular would I ask of any reader who may be willing to
 give me the benefit of his advice. That is to say, I would beg of him to
 suppose, while recording his remarks, that it is for the benefit of a man
 in no way his equal in education, or similar to him in tastes and ideas,
 or capable of apprehending criticisms without full explanation appended,
 that he is doing so. Rather would I ask such a reader to suppose that
 before him there stands a man of incomparably inferior enlightenment and
 schooling?a rude country bumpkin whose life, throughout, has been
 passed in retirement?a bumpkin to whom it is necessary to explain
 each circumstance in detail, while never forgetting to be as simple of
 speech as though he were a child, and at every step there were a danger of
 employing terms beyond his understanding. Should these precautions be kept
 constantly in view by any reader undertaking to annotate my book, that
 reader's remarks will exceed in weight and interest even his own
 expectations, and will bring me very real advantage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus, provided that my earnest request be heeded by my readers, and that
 among them there be found a few kind spirits to do as I desire, the
 following is the manner in which I would request them to transmit their
 notes for my consideration. Inscribing the package with my name, let them
 then enclose that package in a second one addressed either to the Rector
 of the University of St. Petersburg or to Professor Shevirev of the
 University of Moscow, according as the one or the other of those two
 cities may be the nearer to the sender.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lastly, while thanking all journalists and litterateurs for their
 previously published criticisms of my book?criticisms which, in
 spite of a spice of that intemperance and prejudice which is common to all
 humanity, have proved of the greatest use both to my head and to my heart?I
 beg of such writers again to favour me with their reviews. For in all
 sincerity I can assure them that whatsoever they may be pleased to say for
 my improvement and my instruction will be received by me with naught but
 gratitude.

 CHAPTER I
 </h2>
 <p>
 To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart
 britchka?a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors,
 retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of
 about a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen of
 the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a gentleman?a
 man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not over-fat, and not
 over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young. His
 arrival produced no stir in the town, and was accompanied by no particular
 incident, beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at
 the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the
 equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it. "Look at that
 carriage," one of them said to the other. "Think you it will be going as
 far as Moscow?" "I think it will," replied his companion. "But not as far
 as Kazan, eh?" "No, not as far as Kazan." With that the conversation
 ended. Presently, as the britchka was approaching the inn, it was met by a
 young man in a pair of very short, very tight breeches of white dimity, a
 quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and a dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped
 bronze tie-pin. The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka
 and eyed it attentively; after which he clapped his hand to his cap (which
 was in danger of being removed by the wind) and resumed his way. On the
 vehicle reaching the inn door, its occupant found standing there to
 welcome him the polevoi, or waiter, of the establishment?an
 individual of such nimble and brisk movement that even to distinguish the
 character of his face was impossible. Running out with a napkin in one
 hand and his lanky form clad in a tailcoat, reaching almost to the nape of
 his neck, he tossed back his locks, and escorted the gentleman upstairs,
 along a wooden gallery, and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared
 for the gentleman's reception. The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary
 appearance, since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all
 provincial towns?the species wherein, for two roubles a day,
 travellers may obtain a room swarming with black-beetles, and
 communicating by a doorway with the apartment adjoining. True, the doorway
 may be blocked up with a wardrobe; yet behind it, in all probability,
 there will be standing a silent, motionless neighbour whose ears are
 burning to learn every possible detail concerning the latest arrival. The
 inn's exterior corresponded with its interior. Long, and consisting only
 of two storeys, the building had its lower half destitute of stucco; with
 the result that the dark-red bricks, originally more or less dingy, had
 grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes. As for the
 upper half of the building, it was, of course, painted the usual tint of
 unfading yellow. Within, on the ground floor, there stood a number of
 benches heaped with horse-collars, rope, and sheepskins; while the
 window-seat accommodated a sbitentshik <small>4</small>, cheek by
 jowl with a samovar <small>5</small>?the latter so closely
 resembling the former in appearance that, but for the fact of the samovar
 possessing a pitch-black lip, the samovar and the sbitentshik might have
 been two of a pair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the traveller's inspection of his room his luggage was brought into
 the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness
 indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys. The
 bearers of the same were the gentleman's coachman, Selifan (a little man
 in a large overcoat), and the gentleman's valet, Petrushka?the
 latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn, over-ample jacket which
 formerly had graced his master's shoulders, and possessed of a nose and a
 pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen
 expression. Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch-box of redwood,
 lined with birch bark, a boot-case, and (wrapped in blue paper) a roast
 fowl; all of which having been deposited, the coachman departed to look
 after his horses, and the valet to establish himself in the little dark
 anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak, a bagful of
 livery, and his own peculiar smell. Pressing the narrow bedstead back
 against the wall, he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress?a
 remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also as greasy) as a pancake?which
 he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman
 had repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of
 the kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished
 walls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke, are,
 in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers' backs?more
 especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as, on
 market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to the local
 hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind invariably
 contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a number of pendent
 shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the
 shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the glasses looking like a
 flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a selection of oil
 paintings. In short, there are certain objects which one sees in every
 inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the
 fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing
 breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld. A
 similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures
 (of unknown origin, period, and creation) which reach us?sometimes
 through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be
 connoisseurs of art?from Italy; owing to the said magnates having
 made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To resume, however?our traveller removed his cap, and divested his
 neck of a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for
 her husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with
 interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded.
 True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case, God alone
 knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part, I cannot endure
 them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner, and whilst
 the various dishes were being got ready?cabbage soup, a pie several
 weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of sausages and cabbage, a
 roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet tart which stands
 perpetually ready for use in such establishments; whilst, I say, these
 things were either being warmed up or brought in cold, the gentleman
 induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle-tattle concerning
 the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount of income which the hostelry
 produced, and the character of its present proprietor. To the
 last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in
 such cases?namely, "My master is a terribly hard man, sir." Curious
 that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an
 inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him!
 Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless
 ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town, who President of the
 Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short, he omitted no single
 official of note, while asking also (though with an air of detachment) the
 most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood.
 Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and how many of them? How far
 from the town did those landowners reside? What was the character of each
 landowner, and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town?
 The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic
 condition of the countryside. Was there, he asked, much sickness about?whether
 sporadic fever, fatal forms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though
 his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary
 curiosity, his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to
 time he blew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which
 he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for,
 though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in
 intensity, he could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity,
 evoke the waiter's undivided respect?so much so that, whenever the
 sounds of the nose reached that menial's ears, he would shake back his
 locks, straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire
 afresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened to
 require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee,
 and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him, one of those
 wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns, resemble nothing so much
 as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring; whereafter, returning with a
 start to consciousness, he ordered himself to be conducted to his room,
 flung himself at full length upon the bed, and once more slept soundly for
 a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually, by the waiter, he, at the latter's
 request, inscribed a fragment of paper with his name, his surname, and his
 rank (for communication, in accordance with the law, to the police): and
 on that paper the waiter, leaning forward from the corridor, read,
 syllable by syllable: "Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor?Landowner?Travelling
 on Private Affairs." The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat
 before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town. Apparently
 the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the truth, it was at
 least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals. Where the
 staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself
 confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones; which, consisting,
 for the most part, of one or two storeys (added to the range of attics
 which provincial architects love so well), looked almost lost amid the
 expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half-finished
 partition-walls. At other points evidence of more life and movement was to
 be seen, and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed
 dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon boots of cakes or pairs of
 blue breeches inscribed "Arshavski, Tailor," and so forth, were depicted.
 Over a shop containing hats and caps was written "Vassili Thedorov,
 Foreigner"; while, at another spot, a signboard portrayed a billiard table
 and two players?the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually
 affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing
 act of a piece, even though, with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly
 bent, the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim, but
 succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air. Each emporium of
 the sort had written over it: "This is the best establishment of its kind
 in the town." Also, al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped
 with nuts, soap, and gingerbread (the latter but little distinguishable
 from the soap), and at an eating-house there was displayed the sign of a
 plump fish transfixed with a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be
 discerned was the insignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now
 replaced, in this connection, with the laconic inscription "Dramshop"). As
 for the paving of the town, it was uniformly bad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained only
 a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be propped with
 oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast of a height no
 greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet recently the local
 paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, "Thanks to the efforts of our
 Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of
 umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the most sultry day they
 afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of
 our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears
 in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of
 finding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor,
 should he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to inspect
 the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a notice
 affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently read it
 after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant
 exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle, happened to be
 passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare. Lastly, he threw around
 him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in his mind the general
 topography of the place) and betook himself home. There, gently aided by
 the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his bedroom, drank a glass of tea,
 and, seating himself at the table, called for a candle; which having been
 brought him, he produced from his pocket the notice, held it close to the
 flame, and conned its tenour?slightly contracting his right eye as
 he did so. Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark. All that
 it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue's <small>6</small> plays would
 be given, and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a
 certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova,
 while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important
 personages. Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful
 attention, and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the
 performance. Also, he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press
 of the Provincial Government. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to
 see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding
 nothing there, he refolded the document, placed it in the box which served
 him as a receptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with
 a portion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal
 officials?a first, and a very respectful, visit being paid to the
 Governor. This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in that
 he was neither fat nor thin. Also, he wore the riband of the order of
 Saint Anna about his neck, and was reported to have been recommended also
 for the star. For the rest, he was large and good-natured, and had a habit
 of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting. Next, Chichikov
 repaired to the Vice-Governor's, and thence to the house of the Public
 Prosecutor, to that of the President of the Local Council, to that of the
 Chief of Police, to that of the Commissioner of Taxes, and to that of the
 local Director of State Factories. True, the task of remembering every
 big-wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one; but at least our
 visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of paying calls,
 seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to the Inspector of
 the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City Architect. Thereafter
 he sat thoughtfully in his britchka?plunged in meditation on the
 subject of whom else it might be well to visit. However, not a single
 magnate had been neglected, and in conversation with his hosts he had
 contrived to flatter each separate one. For instance to the Governor he
 had hinted that a stranger, on arriving in his, the Governor's province,
 would conceive that he had reached Paradise, so velvety were the roads.
 "Governors who appoint capable subordinates," had said Chichikov, "are
 deserving of the most ample meed of praise." Again, to the Chief of Police
 our hero had passed a most gratifying remark on the subject of the local
 gendarmery; while in his conversation with the Vice-Governor and the
 President of the Local Council (neither of whom had, as yet, risen above
 the rank of State Councillor) he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of
 addressing his interlocutors with the title of "Your Excellency"?a
 blunder which had not failed to delight them. In the result the Governor
 had invited him to a reception the same evening, and certain other
 officials had followed suit by inviting him, one of them to dinner, a
 second to a tea-party, and so forth, and so forth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had spoken
 at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked
 modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed
 something of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that, being
 a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no consideration at
 the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had undergone many strange
 experiences; that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth;
 that he had many enemies seeking his life; and that, being desirous of
 rest, he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell?wherefore,
 having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself, he had
 considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief
 authorities of the place. This, and no more, was all that, for the moment,
 the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival. Naturally he lost no
 time in presenting himself at the Governor's evening party. First,
 however, his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two
 hours, and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly
 seen. That is to say, after a brief post-grandial nap he called for soap
 and water, and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his
 cheeks (which, for the purpose, he supported from within with his tongue)
 and then of drying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a
 towel which he took from the waiter's shoulder. Twice he snorted into the
 waiter's countenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front
 of the mirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs
 which were protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat of
 bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely
 lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor's residence to find it
 illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps, a couple of
 gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions' cries?nothing
 of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on reaching the salon,
 the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment,
 so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps, candles, and feminine apparel.
 Everything seemed suffused with light, and everywhere, flitting and
 flashing, were to be seen black coats?even as on a hot summer's day
 flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it
 into cubes before the open window, and the children of the house crowd
 around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply
 the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons of flies, borne on the breeze,
 enter boldly, as though free of the house, and, taking advantage of the
 fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady's sight,
 disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike, even though
 the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of
 dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less
 for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public,
 of parading up and down the sugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters
 and their fore against one another, of cleaning their bodies under the
 wings, of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming
 themselves, and of flying out of the window again to return with other
 predatory squadrons. Indeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he
 realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to
 his (the Governor's) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head
 sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly
 come from a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor
 excessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the
 remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls,
 Chichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some of
 the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder were
 clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town. Also
 here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and distinct
 categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who, flitting
 around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the
 metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were their whiskers, so
 presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy the manner of their
 dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib their French conversation
 as they quizzed their female companions. As for the other category, it
 comprised individuals who, stout, or of the same build as Chichikov (that
 is to say, neither very portly nor very lean), backed and sidled away from
 the ladies, and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the
 Governor's footmen had set out green tables for whist. Their features were
 full and plump, some of them had beards, and in no case was their hair
 curled or waved or arranged in what the French call "the devil-may-care"
 style. On the contrary, their heads were either close-cropped or brushed
 very smooth, and their faces were round and firm. This category
 represented the more respectable officials of the town. In passing, I may
 say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner
 brethren; which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be
 found in the Political Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence
 is a purely hopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never
 take a back seat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit
 firmly, and with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat
 crack and bend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not
 a rap, and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than
 is the case with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men
 amass the greater wealth. In three years' time a thin man will not have a
 single serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas?well, pray look at a
 fat man's fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban villa,
 and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a town, and
 lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is to say,
 having served both God and the State, the stout individual has won
 universal respect, and will end by retiring from business, reordering his
 mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner?in other words, a
 fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and luxury, and
 is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander
 the same on foreign travel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov's
 reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny.
 And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to
 the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had already recognised
 several familiar faces?namely, those of the Public Prosecutor (a man
 with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink, "Come
 into the next room, my friend, for I have something to say to you"?though,
 in the main, their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit), of the
 Postmaster (an insignificant-looking individual, yet a would-be wit and a
 philosopher), and of the President of the Local Council (a man of much
 amiability and good sense). These three personages greeted Chichikov as an
 old acquaintance, and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong,
 yet a sufficiently civil, bow. Also, he became acquainted with an
 extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov, and with a
 landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch?the latter of
 whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov's toes, and
 then begging his pardon. Next, Chichikov received an offer of a "cut in"
 at whist, and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of
 the head. Seating themselves at a green table, the party did not rise
 therefrom till supper time; and during that period all conversation
 between the players became hushed, as is the custom when men have given
 themselves up to a really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster?a
 talkative man by nature?had no sooner taken the cards into his hands
 than he assumed an expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and
 retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a
 court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to
 exclaim (if the card happened to be a queen), "Now, old popadia <small>7</small>!"
 and (if the card happened to be a king), "Now, peasant of Tambov!" To
 which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted,
 "Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!" And from the
 neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play
 would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames which
 participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits. I
 need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to quarrelling, and
 that in the dispute our friend joined, though so artfully as to let every
 one see that, in spite of the fact that he was wrangling, he was doing so
 only in the most amicable fashion possible. Never did he say outright,
 "You played the wrong card at such and such a point." No, he always
 employed some such phrase as, "You permitted yourself to make a slip, and
 thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce." Indeed, the better to
 keep in accord with his antagonists, he kept offering them his
 silver-enamelled snuff-box (at the bottom of which lay a couple of
 violets, placed there for the sake of their scent). In particular did the
 newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch; so much so
 that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the
 President and the Postmaster rather in the shade. At the same time,
 certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only
 curiosity, but also a certain amount of sound intelligence; for he began
 by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed, and how their
 affairs happened at present to be situated, and then proceeded to
 enlighten himself also as their standing and their families. Indeed, it
 was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends.
 In particular did Manilov?a man still in his prime, and possessed of
 a pair of eyes which, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed?find
 himself unable to make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long
 and fervently by the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour
 of visiting his country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of
 not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in
 return Chichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most
 sincere handshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend's
 behest, but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In
 the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically: "And do you pay ME a
 visit," and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions
 that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed
 difficult?more especially at the present day, when the race of epic
 heroes is beginning to die out in Russia.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief
 of Police?a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat
 down to whist, and remained so seated until two o'clock in the morning. On
 this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a
 landowner named Nozdrev?a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had
 no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he
 began to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did
 the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company had
 no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one and the
 other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev's
 tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played. The following
 evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council, who
 received his guests?even though the latter included two ladies?in
 a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the
 Vice-Governor's, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of
 Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor (a
 very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In
 short, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend
 at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes
 of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and everywhere he
 figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what the
 conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain his part
 in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon
 horse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did
 the company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of
 the most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon a
 prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department,
 instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal
 affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards, on
 that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder. Did a
 reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he hastened to deliver
 himself in a way which brought tears to every eye. Did the subject in hand
 happen to be the distilling of brandy?well, that was a matter
 concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did any one happen to
 mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that moment he expatiated
 as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major. Yet a
 remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper
 his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way, a certain ability so
 to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud
 or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly befitting. In a word, he was
 always a gentleman of excellent manners, and every official in the place
 felt pleased when he saw him enter the door. Thus the Governor gave it as
 his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions; the Public
 Prosecutor, that he was a good man of business; the Chief of Gendarmery,
 that he was a man of education; the President of the Local Council, that
 he was a man of breeding and refinement; and the wife of the Chief of
 Gendarmery, that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his
 affability of bearing. Nay, even Sobakevitch?who as a rule never
 spoke well of ANY ONE?said to his lanky wife when, on returning late
 from the town, he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side: "My
 dear, this evening, after dining with the Chief of Police, I went on to
 the Governor's, and met there, among others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch
 Chichikov, who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow." To
 this his spouse replied "Hm!" and then dealt him a hearty kick in the
 ribs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town; and
 these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality of
 his, a certain scheme of his (the reader will learn presently what it
 was), plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity.

 CHAPTER II
 </h2>
 <p>
 For more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening parties
 and dinners; wherefore he spent (as the saying goes) a very pleasant time.
 Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban boundaries by
 going and calling upon landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch, seeing that he
 had promised on his honour to do so. Yet what really incited him to this
 may have been a more essential cause, a matter of greater gravity, a
 purpose which stood nearer to his heart, than the motive which I have just
 given; and of that purpose the reader will learn if only he will have the
 patience to read this prefatory narrative (which, lengthy though it be,
 may yet develop and expand in proportion as we approach the denouement
 with which the present work is destined to be crowned).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening, therefore, Selifan the coachman received orders to have the
 horses harnessed in good time next morning; while Petrushka received
 orders to remain behind, for the purpose of looking after the portmanteau
 and the room. In passing, the reader may care to become more fully
 acquainted with the two serving-men of whom I have spoken. Naturally, they
 were not persons of much note, but merely what folk call characters of
 secondary, or even of tertiary, importance. Yet, despite the fact that the
 springs and the thread of this romance will not DEPEND upon them, but only
 touch upon them, and occasionally include them, the author has a passion
 for circumstantiality, and, like the average Russian, such a desire for
 accuracy as even a German could not rival. To what the reader already
 knows concerning the personages in hand it is therefore necessary to add
 that Petrushka usually wore a cast-off brown jacket of a size too large
 for him, as also that he had (according to the custom of individuals of
 his calling) a pair of thick lips and a very prominent nose. In
 temperament he was taciturn rather than loquacious, and he cherished a
 yearning for self-education. That is to say, he loved to read books, even
 though their contents came alike to him whether they were books of heroic
 adventure or mere grammars or liturgical compendia. As I say, he perused
 every book with an equal amount of attention, and, had he been offered a
 work on chemistry, would have accepted that also. Not the words which he
 read, but the mere solace derived from the act of reading, was what
 especially pleased his mind; even though at any moment there might launch
 itself from the page some devil-sent word whereof he could make neither
 head nor tail. For the most part, his task of reading was performed in a
 recumbent position in the anteroom; which circumstance ended by causing
 his mattress to become as ragged and as thin as a wafer. In addition to
 his love of poring over books, he could boast of two habits which
 constituted two other essential features of his character?namely, a
 habit of retiring to rest in his clothes (that is to say, in the brown
 jacket above-mentioned) and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own
 peculiar atmosphere, his own peculiar smell?a smell which filled any
 lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed anywhere,
 even in a room hitherto untenanted, and to drag thither his greatcoat and
 other impedimenta, for that room at once to assume an air of having been
 lived in during the past ten years. Nevertheless, though a fastidious, and
 even an irritable, man, Chichikov would merely frown when his nose caught
 this smell amid the freshness of the morning, and exclaim with a toss of
 his head: "The devil only knows what is up with you! Surely you sweat a
 good deal, do you not? The best thing you can do is to go and take a
 bath." To this Petrushka would make no reply, but, approaching, brush in
 hand, the spot where his master's coat would be pendent, or starting to
 arrange one and another article in order, would strive to seem wholly
 immersed in his work. Yet of what was he thinking as he remained thus
 silent? Perhaps he was saying to himself: "My master is a good fellow, but
 for him to keep on saying the same thing forty times over is a little
 wearisome." Only God knows and sees all things; wherefore for a mere human
 being to know what is in the mind of a servant while his master is
 scolding him is wholly impossible. However, no more need be said about
 Petrushka. On the other hand, Coachman Selifan?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But here let me remark that I do not like engaging the reader's attention
 in connection with persons of a lower class than himself; for experience
 has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves with the
 lower orders?that it is the custom of the average Russian to yearn
 exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs of the
 social ladder. In fact, even a bowing acquaintance with a prince or a lord
 counts, in his eyes, for more than do the most intimate of relations with
 ordinary folk. For the same reason the author feels apprehensive on his
 hero's account, seeing that he has made that hero a mere Collegiate
 Councillor?a mere person with whom Aulic Councillors might consort,
 but upon whom persons of the grade of full General <small>8</small> would
 probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is cringing at
 their august feet. Worse still, such persons of the grade of General are
 likely to treat Chichikov with studied negligence?and to an author
 studied negligence spells death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities,
 it is time that I returned to my hero. After issuing, overnight, the
 necessary orders, he awoke early, washed himself, rubbed himself from head
 to foot with a wet sponge (a performance executed only on Sundays?and
 the day in question happened to be a Sunday), shaved his face with such
 care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satin-like smoothness and
 polish, donned first his bilberry-coloured, spotted frockcoat, and then
 his bearskin overcoat, descended the staircase (attended, throughout, by
 the waiter) and entered his britchka. With a loud rattle the vehicle left
 the inn-yard, and issued into the street. A passing priest doffed his cap,
 and a few urchins in grimy shirts shouted, "Gentleman, please give a poor
 orphan a trifle!" Presently the driver noticed that a sturdy young rascal
 was on the point of climbing onto the splashboard; wherefore he cracked
 his whip and the britchka leapt forward with increased speed over the
 cobblestones. At last, with a feeling of relief, the travellers caught
 sight of macadam ahead, which promised an end both to the cobblestones and
 to sundry other annoyances. And, sure enough, after his head had been
 bumped a few more times against the boot of the conveyance, Chichikov
 found himself bowling over softer ground. On the town receding into the
 distance, the sides of the road began to be varied with the usual
 hillocks, fir trees, clumps of young pine, trees with old, scarred trunks,
 bushes of wild juniper, and so forth, Presently there came into view also
 strings of country villas which, with their carved supports and grey roofs
 (the latter looking like pendent, embroidered tablecloths), resembled,
 rather, bundles of old faggots. Likewise the customary peasants, dressed
 in sheepskin jackets, could be seen yawning on benches before their huts,
 while their womenfolk, fat of feature and swathed of bosom, gazed out of
 upper windows, and the windows below displayed, here a peering calf, and
 there the unsightly jaws of a pig. In short, the view was one of the
 familiar type. After passing the fifteenth verst-stone Chichikov suddenly
 recollected that, according to Manilov, fifteen versts was the exact
 distance between his country house and the town; but the sixteenth verst
 stone flew by, and the said country house was still nowhere to be seen. In
 fact, but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to encounter a
 couple of peasants, they would have come on their errand in vain. To a
 query as to whether the country house known as Zamanilovka was anywhere in
 the neighbourhood the peasants replied by doffing their caps; after which
 one of them who seemed to boast of a little more intelligence than his
 companion, and who wore a wedge-shaped beard, made answer:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps you mean Manilovka?not ZAmanilovka?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes?Manilovka."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Manilovka, eh? Well, you must continue for another verst, and then you
 will see it straight before you, on the right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the right?" re-echoed the coachman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, on the right," affirmed the peasant. "You are on the proper road for
 Manilovka, but ZAmanilovka?well, there is no such place. The house
 you mean is called Manilovka because Manilovka is its name; but no house
 at all is called ZAmanilovka. The house you mean stands there, on that
 hill, and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives, and its name is
 Manilovka; but ZAmanilovka does not stand hereabouts, nor ever has stood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the travellers proceeded in search of Manilovka, and, after driving an
 additional two versts, arrived at a spot whence there branched off a
 by-road. Yet two, three, or four versts of the by-road had been covered
 before they saw the least sign of a two-storied stone mansion. Then it was
 that Chichikov suddenly recollected that, when a friend has invited one to
 visit his country house, and has said that the distance thereto is fifteen
 versts, the distance is sure to turn out to be at least thirty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not many people would have admired the situation of Manilov's abode, for
 it stood on an isolated rise and was open to every wind that blew. On the
 slope of the rise lay closely-mown turf, while, disposed here and there,
 after the English fashion, were flower-beds containing clumps of lilac and
 yellow acacia. Also, there were a few insignificant groups of
 slender-leaved, pointed-tipped birch trees, with, under two of the latter,
 an arbour having a shabby green cupola, some blue-painted wooden supports,
 and the inscription "This is the Temple of Solitary Thought." Lower down
 the slope lay a green-coated pond?green-coated ponds constitute a
 frequent spectacle in the gardens of Russian landowners; and, lastly, from
 the foot of the declivity there stretched a line of mouldy, log-built huts
 which, for some obscure reason or another, our hero set himself to count.
 Up to two hundred or more did he count, but nowhere could he perceive a
 single leaf of vegetation or a single stick of timber. The only thing to
 greet the eye was the logs of which the huts were constructed.
 Nevertheless the scene was to a certain extent enlivened by the spectacle
 of two peasant women who, with clothes picturesquely tucked up, were
 wading knee-deep in the pond and dragging behind them, with wooden
 handles, a ragged fishing-net, in the meshes of which two crawfish and a
 roach with glistening scales were entangled. The women appeared to have
 cause of dispute between themselves?to be rating one another about
 something. In the background, and to one side of the house, showed a
 faint, dusky blur of pinewood, and even the weather was in keeping with
 the surroundings, since the day was neither clear nor dull, but of the
 grey tint which may be noted in uniforms of garrison soldiers which have
 seen long service. To complete the picture, a cock, the recognised
 harbinger of atmospheric mutations, was present; and, in spite of the fact
 that a certain connection with affairs of gallantry had led to his having
 had his head pecked bare by other cocks, he flapped a pair of wings?appendages
 as bare as two pieces of bast?and crowed loudly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Chichikov approached the courtyard of the mansion he caught sight of
 his host (clad in a green frock coat) standing on the verandah and
 pressing one hand to his eyes to shield them from the sun and so get a
 better view of the approaching carriage. In proportion as the britchka
 drew nearer and nearer to the verandah, the host's eyes assumed a more and
 more delighted expression, and his smile a broader and broader sweep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Paul Ivanovitch!" he exclaimed when at length Chichikov leapt from the
 vehicle. "Never should I have believed that you would have remembered us!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two friends exchanged hearty embraces, and Manilov then conducted his
 guest to the drawing-room. During the brief time that they are traversing
 the hall, the anteroom, and the dining-room, let me try to say something
 concerning the master of the house. But such an undertaking bristles with
 difficulties?it promises to be a far less easy task than the
 depicting of some outstanding personality which calls but for a wholesale
 dashing of colours upon the canvas?the colours of a pair of dark,
 burning eyes, a pair of dark, beetling brows, a forehead seamed with
 wrinkles, a black, or a fiery-red, cloak thrown backwards over the
 shoulder, and so forth, and so forth. Yet, so numerous are Russian serf
 owners that, though careful scrutiny reveals to one's sight a quantity of
 outre peculiarities, they are, as a class, exceedingly difficult to
 portray, and one needs to strain one's faculties to the utmost before it
 becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle, their almost
 invisible, features. In short, one needs, before doing this, to carry out
 a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight sharpened in the acute
 school of research.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Only God can say what Manilov's real character was. A class of men exists
 whom the proverb has described as "men unto themselves, neither this nor
 that?neither Bogdan of the city nor Selifan of the village." And to
 that class we had better assign also Manilov. Outwardly he was presentable
 enough, for his features were not wanting in amiability, but that
 amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the sugary
 element, so that his every gesture, his every attitude, seemed to connote
 an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer
 acquaintance. On first speaking to the man, his ingratiating smile, his
 flaxen hair, and his blue eyes would lead one to say, "What a pleasant,
 good-tempered fellow he seems!" yet during the next moment or two one
 would feel inclined to say nothing at all, and, during the third moment,
 only to say, "The devil alone knows what he is!" And should, thereafter,
 one not hasten to depart, one would inevitably become overpowered with the
 deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing in the
 least interesting is to be looked for, but only a series of wearisome
 utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips of a man whose
 hobby has once been touched upon. For every man HAS his hobby. One man's
 may be sporting dogs; another man's may be that of believing himself to be
 a lover of music, and able to sound the art to its inmost depths;
 another's may be that of posing as a connoisseur of recherche cookery;
 another's may be that of aspiring to play roles of a kind higher than
 nature has assigned him; another's (though this is a more limited
 ambition) may be that of getting drunk, and of dreaming that he is
 edifying both his friends, his acquaintances, and people with whom he has
 no connection at all by walking arm-in-arm with an Imperial aide-de-camp;
 another's may be that of possessing a hand able to chip corners off aces
 and deuces of diamonds; another's may be that of yearning to set things
 straight?in other words, to approximate his personality to that of a
 stationmaster or a director of posts. In short, almost every man has his
 hobby or his leaning; yet Manilov had none such, for at home he spoke
 little, and spent the greater part of his time in meditation?though
 God only knows what that meditation comprised! Nor can it be said that he
 took much interest in the management of his estate, for he never rode into
 the country, and the estate practically managed itself. Whenever the
 bailiff said to him, "It might be well to have such-and-such a thing
 done," he would reply, "Yes, that is not a bad idea," and then go on
 smoking his pipe?a habit which he had acquired during his service in
 the army, where he had been looked upon as an officer of modesty,
 delicacy, and refinement. "Yes, it is NOT a bad idea," he would repeat.
 Again, whenever a peasant approached him and, rubbing the back of his
 neck, said "Barin, may I have leave to go and work for myself, in order
 that I may earn my obrok <small>9</small>?" he would snap out, with pipe in
 mouth as usual, "Yes, go!" and never trouble his head as to whether the
 peasant's real object might not be to go and get drunk. True, at intervals
 he would say, while gazing from the verandah to the courtyard, and from
 the courtyard to the pond, that it would be indeed splendid if a carriage
 drive could suddenly materialise, and the pond as suddenly become spanned
 with a stone bridge, and little shops as suddenly arise whence pedlars
 could dispense the petty merchandise of the kind which peasantry most
 need. And at such moments his eyes would grow winning, and his features
 assume an expression of intense satisfaction. Yet never did these projects
 pass beyond the stage of debate. Likewise there lay in his study a book
 with the fourteenth page permanently turned down. It was a book which he
 had been reading for the past two years! In general, something seemed to
 be wanting in the establishment. For instance, although the drawing-room
 was filled with beautiful furniture, and upholstered in some fine silken
 material which clearly had cost no inconsiderable sum, two of the chairs
 lacked any covering but bast, and for some years past the master had been
 accustomed to warn his guests with the words, "Do not sit upon these
 chairs; they are not yet ready for use." Another room contained no
 furniture at all, although, a few days after the marriage, it had been
 said: "My dear, to-morrow let us set about procuring at least some
 TEMPORARY furniture for this room." Also, every evening would see placed
 upon the drawing-room table a fine bronze candelabrum, a statuette
 representative of the Three Graces, a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
 and a rickety, lop-sided copper invalide. Yet of the fact that all four
 articles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the house
 nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least suspicion.
 At the same time, Manilov and his wife were quite satisfied with each
 other. More than eight years had elapsed since their marriage, yet one of
 them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of apple or a bonbon
 or a nut, while murmuring some tender something which voiced a
 whole-hearted affection. "Open your mouth, dearest"?thus ran the
 formula?"and let me pop into it this titbit." You may be sure that
 on such occasions the "dearest mouth" parted its lips most graciously! For
 their mutual birthdays the pair always contrived some "surprise present"
 in the shape of a glass receptacle for tooth-powder, or what not; and as
 they sat together on the sofa he would suddenly, and for some unknown
 reason, lay aside his pipe, and she her work (if at the moment she
 happened to be holding it in her hands) and husband and wife would imprint
 upon one another's cheeks such a prolonged and languishing kiss that
 during its continuance you could have smoked a small cigar. In short, they
 were what is known as "a very happy couple." Yet it may be remarked that a
 household requires other pursuits to be engaged in than lengthy embracings
 and the preparing of cunning "surprises." Yes, many a function calls for
 fulfilment. For instance, why should it be thought foolish or low to
 superintend the kitchen? Why should care not be taken that the storeroom
 never lacks supplies? Why should a housekeeper be allowed to thieve? Why
 should slovenly and drunken servants exist? Why should a domestic staff be
 suffered in indulge in bouts of unconscionable debauchery during its
 leisure time? Yet none of these things were thought worthy of
 consideration by Manilov's wife, for she had been gently brought up, and
 gentle nurture, as we all know, is to be acquired only in boarding
 schools, and boarding schools, as we know, hold the three principal
 subjects which constitute the basis of human virtue to be the French
 language (a thing indispensable to the happiness of married life),
 piano-playing (a thing wherewith to beguile a husband's leisure moments),
 and that particular department of housewifery which is comprised in the
 knitting of purses and other "surprises." Nevertheless changes and
 improvements have begun to take place, since things now are governed more
 by the personal inclinations and idiosyncracies of the keepers of such
 establishments. For instance, in some seminaries the regimen places
 piano-playing first, and the French language second, and then the above
 department of housewifery; while in other seminaries the knitting of
 "surprises" heads the list, and then the French language, and then the
 playing of pianos?so diverse are the systems in force! None the
 less, I may remark that Madame Manilov?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But let me confess that I always shrink from saying too much about ladies.
 Moreover, it is time that we returned to our heroes, who, during the past
 few minutes, have been standing in front of the drawing-room door, and
 engaged in urging one another to enter first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pray be so good as not to inconvenience yourself on my account," said
 Chichikov. "<i>I</i> will follow YOU."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Paul Ivanovitch?no! You are my guest." And Manilov pointed
 towards the doorway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Make no difficulty about it, I pray," urged Chichikov. "I beg of you to
 make no difficulty about it, but to pass into the room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, I will not. Never could I allow so distinguished and so
 welcome a guest as yourself to take second place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why call me 'distinguished,' my dear sir? I beg of you to proceed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay; be YOU pleased to do so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For the reason which I have stated." And Manilov smiled his very
 pleasantest smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally the pair entered simultaneously and sideways; with the result that
 they jostled one another not a little in the process.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Allow me to present to you my wife," continued Manilov. "My dear?Paul
 Ivanovitch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that Chichikov caught sight of a lady whom hitherto he had
 overlooked, but who, with Manilov, was now bowing to him in the doorway.
 Not wholly of unpleasing exterior, she was dressed in a well-fitting,
 high-necked morning dress of pale-coloured silk; and as the visitor
 entered the room her small white hands threw something upon the table and
 clutched her embroidered skirt before rising from the sofa where she had
 been seated. Not without a sense of pleasure did Chichikov take her hand
 as, lisping a little, she declared that she and her husband were equally
 gratified by his coming, and that, of late, not a day had passed without
 her husband recalling him to mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," affirmed Manilov; "and every day SHE has said to ME: 'Why does not
 your friend put in an appearance?' 'Wait a little dearest,' I have always
 replied. ''Twill not be long now before he comes.' And you HAVE come, you
 HAVE honoured us with a visit, you HAVE bestowed upon us a treat?a
 treat destined to convert this day into a gala day, a true birthday of the
 heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The intimation that matters had reached the point of the occasion being
 destined to constitute a "true birthday of the heart" caused Chichikov to
 become a little confused; wherefore he made modest reply that, as a matter
 of fact, he was neither of distinguished origin nor distinguished rank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, you ARE so," interrupted Manilov with his fixed and engaging smile.
 "You are all that, and more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How like you our town?" queried Madame. "Have you spent an agreeable time
 in it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very," replied Chichikov. "The town is an exceedingly nice one, and I
 have greatly enjoyed its hospitable society."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what do you think of our Governor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; IS he not a most engaging and dignified personage?" added Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is all that," assented Chichikov. "Indeed, he is a man worthy of the
 greatest respect. And how thoroughly he performs his duty according to his
 lights! Would that we had more like him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the tactfulness with which he greets every one!" added Manilov,
 smiling, and half-closing his eyes, like a cat which is being tickled
 behind the ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so," assented Chichikov. "He is a man of the most eminent civility
 and approachableness. And what an artist! Never should I have thought he
 could have worked the marvellous household samplers which he has done!
 Some specimens of his needlework which he showed me could not well have
 been surpassed by any lady in the land!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the Vice-Governor, too?he is a nice man, is he not?" inquired
 Manilov with renewed blinkings of the eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who? The Vice-Governor? Yes, a most worthy fellow!" replied Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what of the Chief of Police? Is it not a fact that he too is in the
 highest degree agreeable?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very agreeable indeed. And what a clever, well-read individual! With him
 and the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Local Council I played
 whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow. He is a most
 excellent fellow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what of his wife?" queried Madame Manilov. "Is she not a most
 gracious personality?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One of the best among my limited acquaintance," agreed Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nor were the President of the Local Council and the Postmaster overlooked;
 until the company had run through the whole list of urban officials. And
 in every case those officials appeared to be persons of the highest
 possible merit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you devote your time entirely to your estate?" asked Chichikov, in his
 turn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, most of it," replied Manilov; "though also we pay occasional visits
 to the town, in order that we may mingle with a little well-bred society.
 One grows a trifle rusty if one lives for ever in retirement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so," agreed Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, quite so," capped Manilov. "At the same time, it would be a
 different matter if the neighbourhood were a GOOD one?if, for
 example, one had a friend with whom one could discuss manners and polite
 deportment, or engage in some branch of science, and so stimulate one's
 wits. For that sort of thing gives one's intellect an airing. It, it?"
 At a loss for further words, he ended by remarking that his feelings were
 apt to carry him away; after which he continued with a gesture: "What I
 mean is that, were that sort of thing possible, I, for one, could find the
 country and an isolated life possessed of great attractions. But, as
 matters stand, such a thing is NOT possible. All that I can manage to do
 is, occasionally, to read a little of A Son of the Fatherland."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With these sentiments Chichikov expressed entire agreement: adding that
 nothing could be more delightful than to lead a solitary life in which
 there should be comprised only the sweet contemplation of nature and the
 intermittent perusal of a book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, but even THAT were worth nothing had not one a friend with whom to
 share one's life," remarked Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True, true," agreed Chichikov. "Without a friend, what are all the
 treasures in the world? 'Possess not money,' a wise man has said, 'but
 rather good friends to whom to turn in case of need.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Paul Ivanovitch," said Manilov with a glance not merely sweet, but
 positively luscious?a glance akin to the mixture which even clever
 physicians have to render palatable before they can induce a hesitant
 patient to take it. "Consequently you may imagine what happiness?what
 PERFECT happiness, so to speak?the present occasion has brought me,
 seeing that I am permitted to converse with you and to enjoy your
 conversation."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But WHAT of my conversation?" replied Chichikov. "I am an insignificant
 individual, and, beyond that, nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Paul Ivanovitch!" cried the other. "Permit me to be frank, and to say
 that I would give half my property to possess even a PORTION of the
 talents which you possess."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the contrary, I should consider it the highest honour in the world if?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lengths to which this mutual outpouring of soul would have proceeded
 had not a servant entered to announce luncheon must remain a mystery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I humbly invite you to join us at table," said Manilov. "Also, you will
 pardon us for the fact that we cannot provide a banquet such as is to be
 obtained in our metropolitan cities? We partake of simple fare, according
 to Russian custom?we confine ourselves to shtchi <small>10</small>,
 but we do so with a single heart. Come, I humbly beg of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After another contest for the honour of yielding precedence, Chichikov
 succeeded in making his way (in zigzag fashion) to the dining-room, where
 they found awaiting them a couple of youngsters. These were Manilov's
 sons, and boys of the age which admits of their presence at table, but
 necessitates the continued use of high chairs. Beside them was their
 tutor, who bowed politely and smiled; after which the hostess took her
 seat before her soup plate, and the guest of honour found himself esconsed
 between her and the master of the house, while the servant tied up the
 boys' necks in bibs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What charming children!" said Chichikov as he gazed at the pair. "And how
 old are they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The eldest is eight," replied Manilov, "and the younger one attained the
 age of six yesterday."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Themistocleus," went on the father, turning to his first-born, who was
 engaged in striving to free his chin from the bib with which the footman
 had encircled it. On hearing this distinctly Greek name (to which, for
 some unknown reason, Manilov always appended the termination "eus"),
 Chichikov raised his eyebrows a little, but hastened, the next moment, to
 restore his face to a more befitting expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Themistocleus," repeated the father, "tell me which is the finest city in
 France."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon Themistocleus, and
 appeared to be trying hard to catch his eye. Only when Themistocleus had
 muttered "Paris" did the preceptor grow calmer, and nod his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And which is the finest city in Russia?" continued Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the tutor's attitude became wholly one of concentration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "St. Petersburg," replied Themistocleus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what other city?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Moscow," responded the boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Clever little dear!" burst out Chichikov, turning with an air of surprise
 to the father. "Indeed, I feel bound to say that the child evinces the
 greatest possible potentialities."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do not know him fully," replied the delighted Manilov. "The amount of
 sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary. Our younger one, Alkid, is
 not so quick; whereas his brother?well, no matter what he may happen
 upon (whether upon a cowbug or upon a water-beetle or upon anything else),
 his little eyes begin jumping out of his head, and he runs to catch the
 thing, and to inspect it. For HIM I am reserving a diplomatic post.
 Themistocleus," added the father, again turning to his son, "do you wish
 to become an ambassador?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I do," replied Themistocleus, chewing a piece of bread and wagging
 his head from side to side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this moment the lacquey who had been standing behind the future
 ambassador wiped the latter's nose; and well it was that he did so, since
 otherwise an inelegant and superfluous drop would have been added to the
 soup. After that the conversation turned upon the joys of a quiet life?though
 occasionally it was interrupted by remarks from the hostess on the subject
 of acting and actors. Meanwhile the tutor kept his eyes fixed upon the
 speakers' faces; and whenever he noticed that they were on the point of
 laughing he at once opened his mouth, and laughed with enthusiasm.
 Probably he was a man of grateful heart who wished to repay his employers
 for the good treatment which he had received. Once, however, his features
 assumed a look of grimness as, fixing his eyes upon his vis-a-vis, the
 boys, he tapped sternly upon the table. This happened at a juncture when
 Themistocleus had bitten Alkid on the ear, and the said Alkid, with
 frowning eyes and open mouth, was preparing himself to sob in piteous
 fashion; until, recognising that for such a proceeding he might possibly
 be deprived of his plate, he hastened to restore his mouth to its original
 expression, and fell tearfully to gnawing a mutton bone?the grease
 from which had soon covered his cheeks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every now and again the hostess would turn to Chichikov with the words,
 "You are eating nothing?you have indeed taken little;" but
 invariably her guest replied: "Thank you, I have had more than enough. A
 pleasant conversation is worth all the dishes in the world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length the company rose from table. Manilov was in high spirits, and,
 laying his hand upon his guest's shoulder, was on the point of conducting
 him to the drawing-room, when suddenly Chichikov intimated to him, with a
 meaning look, that he wished to speak to him on a very important matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That being so," said Manilov, "allow me to invite you into my study." And
 he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest. "This
 is my sanctum," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a pleasant apartment!" remarked Chichikov as he eyed it carefully.
 And, indeed, the room did not lack a certain attractiveness. The walls
 were painted a sort of blueish-grey colour, and the furniture consisted of
 four chairs, a settee, and a table?the latter of which bore a few
 sheets of writing-paper and the book of which I have before had occasion
 to speak. But the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco, which
 appeared in many different guises?in packets, in a tobacco jar, and
 in a loose heap strewn about the table. Likewise, both window sills were
 studded with little heaps of ash, arranged, not without artifice, in rows
 of more or less tidiness. Clearly smoking afforded the master of the house
 a frequent means of passing the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Permit me to offer you a seat on this settee," said Manilov. "Here you
 will be quieter than you would be in the drawing-room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I should prefer to sit upon this chair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot allow that," objected the smiling Manilov. "The settee is
 specially reserved for my guests. Whether you choose or no, upon it you
 MUST sit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Accordingly Chichikov obeyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And also let me hand you a pipe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I never smoke," answered Chichikov civilly, and with an assumed air
 of regret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why?" inquired Manilov?equally civilly, but with a regret that
 was wholly genuine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I fear that I have never quite formed the habit, owing to my
 having heard that a pipe exercises a desiccating effect upon the system."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then allow me to tell you that that is mere prejudice. Nay, I would even
 go so far as to say that to smoke a pipe is a healthier practice than to
 take snuff. Among its members our regiment numbered a lieutenant?a
 most excellent, well-educated fellow?who was simply INCAPABLE of
 removing his pipe from his mouth, whether at table or (pardon me) in other
 places. He is now forty, yet no man could enjoy better health than he has
 always done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov replied that such cases were common, since nature comprised many
 things which even the finest intellect could not compass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But allow me to put to you a question," he went on in a tone in which
 there was a strange?or, at all events, RATHER a strange?note.
 For some unknown reason, also, he glanced over his shoulder. For some
 equally unknown reason, Manilov glanced over HIS.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long is it," inquired the guest, "since you last rendered a census
 return?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, a long, long time. In fact, I cannot remember when it was."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And since then have many of your serfs died?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not know. To ascertain that I should need to ask my bailiff.
 Footman, go and call the bailiff. I think he will be at home to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before long the bailiff made his appearance. He was a man of under forty,
 clean-shaven, clad in a smock, and evidently used to a quiet life, seeing
 that his face was of that puffy fullness, and the skin encircling his
 slit-like eyes was of that sallow tint, which shows that the owner of
 those features is well acquainted with a feather bed. In a trice it could
 be seen that he had played his part in life as all such bailiffs do?that,
 originally a young serf of elementary education, he had married some
 Agashka of a housekeeper or a mistress's favourite, and then himself
 become housekeeper, and, subsequently, bailiff; after which he had
 proceeded according to the rules of his tribe?that is to say, he had
 consorted with and stood in with the more well-to-do serfs on the estate,
 and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok, while
 himself leaving his bed at nine o'clock in the morning, and, when the
 samovar had been brought, drinking his tea at leisure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, my good man," said Manilov. "How many of our serfs have died
 since the last census revision?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How many of them have died? Why, a great many." The bailiff hiccoughed,
 and slapped his mouth lightly after doing so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I imagined that to be the case," corroborated Manilov. "In fact, a
 VERY great many serfs have died." He turned to Chichikov and repeated the
 words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How many, for instance?" asked Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; how many?" re-echoed Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "HOW many?" re-echoed the bailiff. "Well, no one knows the exact number,
 for no one has kept any account."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so," remarked Manilov. "I supposed the death-rate to have been
 high, but was ignorant of its precise extent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then would you be so good as to have it computed for me?" said Chichikov.
 "And also to have a detailed list of the deaths made out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I will?a detailed list," agreed Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bailiff departed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For what purpose do you want it?" inquired Manilov when the bailiff had
 gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The question seemed to embarrass the guest, for in Chichikov's face there
 dawned a sort of tense expression, and it reddened as though its owner
 were striving to express something not easy to put into words. True
 enough, Manilov was now destined to hear such strange and unexpected
 things as never before had greeted human ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You ask me," said Chichikov, "for what purpose I want the list. Well, my
 purpose in wanting it is this?that I desire to purchase a few
 peasants." And he broke off in a gulp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But may I ask HOW you desire to purchase those peasants?" asked Manilov.
 "With land, or merely as souls for transferment?that is to say, by
 themselves, and without any land?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want the peasants themselves only," replied Chichikov. "And I want dead
 ones at that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What??Excuse me, but I am a trifle deaf. Really, your words sound
 most strange!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All that I am proposing to do," replied Chichikov, "is to purchase the
 dead peasants who, at the last census, were returned by you as alive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manilov dropped his pipe on the floor, and sat gaping. Yes, the two
 friends who had just been discussing the joys of camaraderie sat staring
 at one another like the portraits which, of old, used to hang on opposite
 sides of a mirror. At length Manilov picked up his pipe, and, while doing
 so, glanced covertly at Chichikov to see whether there was any trace of a
 smile to be detected on his lips?whether, in short, he was joking.
 But nothing of the sort could be discerned. On the contrary, Chichikov's
 face looked graver than usual. Next, Manilov wondered whether, for some
 unknown reason, his guest had lost his wits; wherefore he spent some time
 in gazing at him with anxious intentness. But the guest's eyes seemed
 clear?they contained no spark of the wild, restless fire which is
 apt to wander in the eyes of madmen. All was as it should be.
 Consequently, in spite of Manilov's cogitations, he could think of nothing
 better to do than to sit letting a stream of tobacco smoke escape from his
 mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So," continued Chichikov, "what I desire to know is whether you are
 willing to hand over to me?to resign?these actually
 non-living, but legally living, peasants; or whether you have any better
 proposal to make?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manilov felt too confused and confounded to do aught but continue staring
 at his interlocutor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily," was Chichikov's
 next remark.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I? Oh no! Not at all!" stammered Manilov. "Only?pardon me?I
 do not quite comprehend you. You see, never has it fallen to my lot to
 acquire the brilliant polish which is, so to speak, manifest in your every
 movement. Nor have I ever been able to attain the art of expressing myself
 well. Consequently, although there is a possibility that in the?er?utterances
 which have just fallen from your lips there may lie something else
 concealed, it may equally be that?er?you have been pleased so
 to express yourself for the sake of the beauty of the terms wherein that
 expression found shape?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no," asserted Chichikov. "I mean what I say and no more. My reference
 to such of your pleasant souls as are dead was intended to be taken
 literally."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manilov still felt at a loss?though he was conscious that he MUST do
 something, he MUST propound some question. But what question? The devil
 alone knew! In the end he merely expelled some more tobacco smoke?this
 time from his nostrils as well as from his mouth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So," went on Chichikov, "if no obstacle stands in the way, we might as
 well proceed to the completion of the purchase."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? Of the purchase of the dead souls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of the 'dead' souls? Oh dear no! Let us write them down as LIVING ones,
 seeing that that is how they figure in the census returns. Never do I
 permit myself to step outside the civil law, great though has been the
 harm which that rule has wrought me in my career. In my eyes an obligation
 is a sacred thing. In the presence of the law I am dumb."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These last words reassured Manilov not a little: yet still the meaning of
 the affair remained to him a mystery. By way of answer, he fell to sucking
 at his pipe with such vehemence that at length the pipe began to gurgle
 like a bassoon. It was as though he had been seeking of it inspiration in
 the present unheard-of juncture. But the pipe only gurgled, et praeterea
 nihil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps you feel doubtful about the proposal?" said Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all," replied Manilov. "But you will, I know, excuse me if I say
 (and I say it out of no spirit of prejudice, nor yet as criticising
 yourself in any way)?you will, I know, excuse me if I say that
 possibly this?er?this, er, SCHEME of yours, this?er?TRANSACTION
 of yours, may fail altogether to accord with the Civil Statutes and
 Provisions of the Realm?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And Manilov, with a slight gesture of the head, looked meaningly into
 Chichikov's face, while displaying in his every feature, including his
 closely-compressed lips, such an expression of profundity as never before
 was seen on any human countenance?unless on that of some
 particularly sapient Minister of State who is debating some particularly
 abstruse problem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nevertheless Chichikov rejoined that the kind of scheme or transaction
 which he had adumbrated in no way clashed with the Civil Statutes and
 Provisions of Russia; to which he added that the Treasury would even
 BENEFIT by the enterprise, seeing it would draw therefrom the usual legal
 percentage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, then, do you propose?" asked Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I propose only what is above-board, and nothing else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, that being so, it is another matter, and I have nothing to urge
 against it," said Manilov, apparently reassured to the full.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," remarked Chichikov. "Then we need only to agree as to the
 price."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As to the price?" began Manilov, and then stopped. Presently he went on:
 "Surely you cannot suppose me capable of taking money for souls which, in
 one sense at least, have completed their existence? Seeing that this
 fantastic whim of yours (if I may so call it?) has seized upon you to the
 extent that it has, I, on my side, shall be ready to surrender to you
 those souls UNCONDITIONALLY, and to charge myself with the whole expenses
 of the sale."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I should be greatly to blame if I were to omit that, as soon as Manilov
 had pronounced these words, the face of his guest became replete with
 satisfaction. Indeed, grave and prudent a man though Chichikov was, he had
 much ado to refrain from executing a leap that would have done credit to a
 goat (an animal which, as we all know, finds itself moved to such
 exertions only during moments of the most ecstatic joy). Nevertheless the
 guest did at least execute such a convulsive shuffle that the material
 with which the cushions of the chair were covered came apart, and Manilov
 gazed at him with some misgiving. Finally Chichikov's gratitude led him to
 plunge into a stream of acknowledgement of a vehemence which caused his
 host to grow confused, to blush, to shake his head in deprecation, and to
 end by declaring that the concession was nothing, and that, his one desire
 being to manifest the dictates of his heart and the psychic magnetism
 which his friend exercised, he, in short, looked upon the dead souls as so
 much worthless rubbish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all," replied Chichikov, pressing his hand; after which he heaved
 a profound sigh. Indeed, he seemed in the right mood for outpourings of
 the heart, for he continued?not without a ring of emotion in his
 tone: "If you but knew the service which you have rendered to an
 apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both of family and
 kindred! For what have I not suffered in my time?I, a drifting
 barque amid the tempestuous billows of life? What harryings, what
 persecutions, have I not known? Of what grief have I not tasted? And why?
 Simply because I have ever kept the truth in view, because ever I have
 preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience, because ever I have stretched
 out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless orphan!" After
 which outpouring Chichikov pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped away a
 brimming tear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manilov's heart was moved to the core. Again and again did the two friends
 press one another's hands in silence as they gazed into one another's
 tear-filled eyes. Indeed, Manilov COULD not let go our hero's hand, but
 clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began to feel
 himself at a loss how best to wrench it free: until, quietly withdrawing
 it, he observed that to have the purchase completed as speedily as
 possible would not be a bad thing; wherefore he himself would at once
 return to the town to arrange matters. Taking up his hat, therefore, he
 rose to make his adieus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? Are you departing already?" said Manilov, suddenly recovering
 himself, and experiencing a sense of misgiving. At that moment his wife
 sailed into the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Paul Ivanovitch leaving us so soon, dearest Lizanka?" she said with an
 air of regret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Surely it must be that we have wearied him?" her spouse replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By no means," asserted Chichikov, pressing his hand to his heart. "In
 this breast, madam, will abide for ever the pleasant memory of the time
 which I have spent with you. Believe me, I could conceive of no greater
 blessing than to reside, if not under the same roof as yourselves, at all
 events in your immediate neighbourhood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed?" exclaimed Manilov, greatly pleased with the idea. "How splendid
 it would be if you DID come to reside under our roof, so that we could
 recline under an elm tree together, and talk philosophy, and delve to the
 very root of things!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it WOULD be a paradisaical existence!" agreed Chichikov with a sigh.
 Nevertheless he shook hands with Madame. "Farewell, sudarina," he said.
 "And farewell to YOU, my esteemed host. Do not forget what I have
 requested you to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rest assured that I will not," responded Manilov. "Only for a couple of
 days will you and I be parted from one another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that the party moved into the drawing-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Farewell, dearest children," Chichikov went on as he caught sight of
 Alkid and Themistocleus, who were playing with a wooden hussar which
 lacked both a nose and one arm. "Farewell, dearest pets. Pardon me for
 having brought you no presents, but, to tell you the truth, I was not,
 until my visit, aware of your existence. However, now that I shall be
 coming again, I will not fail to bring you gifts. Themistocleus, to you I
 will bring a sword. You would like that, would you not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should," replied Themistocleus.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And to you, Alkid, I will bring a drum. That would suit you, would it
 not?" And he bowed in Alkid's direction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Zeth?a drum," lisped the boy, hanging his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! Then a drum it shall be?SUCH a beautiful drum! What a
 tur-r-r-ru-ing and a tra-ta-ta-ta-ing you will be able to kick up!
 Farewell, my darling." And, kissing the boy's head, he turned to Manilov
 and Madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring parents
 of the guileless merits of their offspring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you had better stay, Paul Ivanovitch," said the father as the trio
 stepped out on to the verandah. "See how the clouds are gathering!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are only small ones," replied Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you know your way to Sobakevitch's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I do not, and should be glad if you would direct me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you like I will tell your coachman." And in very civil fashion Manilov
 did so, even going so far as to address the man in the second person
 plural. On hearing that he was to pass two turnings, and then to take a
 third, Selifan remarked, "We shall get there all right, sir," and
 Chichikov departed amid a profound salvo of salutations and wavings of
 handkerchiefs on the part of his host and hostess, who raised themselves
 on tiptoe in their enthusiasm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a long while Manilov stood following the departing britchka with his
 eyes. In fact, he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the vehicle
 even when it had become lost to view. Then he re-entered the drawing-room,
 seated himself upon a chair, and surrendered his mind to the thought that
 he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment. Next, his mind passed
 imperceptibly to other matters, until at last it lost itself God only
 knows where. He thought of the amenities of a life, of friendship, and of
 how nice it would be to live with a comrade on, say, the bank of some
 river, and to span the river with a bridge of his own, and to build an
 enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to
 Moscow. On that facade he and his wife and friend would drink afternoon
 tea in the open air, and discuss interesting subjects; after which, in a
 fine carriage, they would drive to some reunion or other, where with their
 pleasant manners they would so charm the company that the Imperial
 Government, on learning of their merits, would raise the pair to the grade
 of General or God knows what?that is to say, to heights whereof even
 Manilov himself could form no idea. Then suddenly Chichikov's
 extraordinary request interrupted the dreamer's reflections, and he found
 his brain powerless to digest it, seeing that, turn and turn the matter
 about as he might, he could not properly explain its bearing. Smoking his
 pipe, he sat where he was until supper time.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER III
 </h2>
 <p>
 Meanwhile, Chichikov, seated in his britchka and bowling along the
 turnpike, was feeling greatly pleased with himself. From the preceding
 chapter the reader will have gathered the principal subject of his bent
 and inclinations: wherefore it is no matter for wonder that his body and
 his soul had ended by becoming wholly immersed therein. To all appearances
 the thoughts, the calculations, and the projects which were now reflected
 in his face partook of a pleasant nature, since momentarily they kept
 leaving behind them a satisfied smile. Indeed, so engrossed was he that he
 never noticed that his coachman, elated with the hospitality of Manilov's
 domestics, was making remarks of a didactic nature to the off horse of the
 troika <small>11</small>,
 a skewbald. This skewbald was a knowing animal, and made only a show of
 pulling; whereas its comrades, the middle horse (a bay, and known as the
 Assessor, owing to his having been acquired from a gentleman of that rank)
 and the near horse (a roan), would do their work gallantly, and even
 evince in their eyes the pleasure which they derived from their exertions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, you rascal, you rascal! I'll get the better of you!" ejaculated
 Selifan as he sat up and gave the lazy one a cut with his whip. "YOU know
 your business all right, you German pantaloon! The bay is a good fellow,
 and does his duty, and I will give him a bit over his feed, for he is a
 horse to be respected; and the Assessor too is a good horse. But what are
 YOU shaking your ears for? You are a fool, so just mind when you're spoken
 to. 'Tis good advice I'm giving you, you blockhead. Ah! You CAN travel
 when you like." And he gave the animal another cut, and then shouted to
 the trio, "Gee up, my beauties!" and drew his whip gently across the backs
 of the skewbald's comrades?not as a punishment, but as a sign of his
 approval. That done, he addressed himself to the skewbald again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you think," he cried, "that I don't see what you are doing? You can
 behave quite decently when you like, and make a man respect you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that he fell to recalling certain reminiscences.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They were NICE folk, those folk at the gentleman's yonder," he mused. "I
 DO love a chat with a man when he is a good sort. With a man of that kind
 I am always hail-fellow-well-met, and glad to drink a glass of tea with
 him, or to eat a biscuit. One CAN'T help respecting a decent fellow. For
 instance, this gentleman of mine?why, every one looks up to him, for
 he has been in the Government's service, and is a Collegiate Councillor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus soliloquising, he passed to more remote abstractions; until, had
 Chichikov been listening, he would have learnt a number of interesting
 details concerning himself. However, his thoughts were wholly occupied
 with his own subject, so much so that not until a loud clap of thunder
 awoke him from his reverie did he glance around him. The sky was
 completely covered with clouds, and the dusty turnpike beginning to be
 sprinkled with drops of rain. At length a second and a nearer and a louder
 peal resounded, and the rain descended as from a bucket. Falling
 slantwise, it beat upon one side of the basketwork of the tilt until the
 splashings began to spurt into his face, and he found himself forced to
 draw the curtains (fitted with circular openings through which to obtain a
 glimpse of the wayside view), and to shout to Selifan to quicken his pace.
 Upon that the coachman, interrupted in the middle of his harangue,
 bethought him that no time was to be lost; wherefore, extracting from
 under the box-seat a piece of old blanket, he covered over his sleeves,
 resumed the reins, and cheered on his threefold team (which, it may be
 said, had so completely succumbed to the influence of the pleasant
 lassitude induced by Selifan's discourse that it had taken to scarcely
 placing one leg before the other). Unfortunately, Selifan could not
 clearly remember whether two turnings had been passed or three. Indeed, on
 collecting his faculties, and dimly recalling the lie of the road, he
 became filled with a shrewd suspicion that A VERY LARGE NUMBER of turnings
 had been passed. But since, at moments which call for a hasty decision, a
 Russian is quick to discover what may conceivably be the best course to
 take, our coachman put away from him all ulterior reasoning, and, turning
 to the right at the next cross-road, shouted, "Hi, my beauties!" and set
 off at a gallop. Never for a moment did he stop to think whither the road
 might lead him!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was long before the clouds had discharged their burden, and, meanwhile,
 the dust on the road became kneaded into mire, and the horses' task of
 pulling the britchka heavier and heavier. Also, Chichikov had taken alarm
 at his continued failure to catch sight of Sobakevitch's country house.
 According to his calculations, it ought to have been reached long ago. He
 gazed about him on every side, but the darkness was too dense for the eye
 to pierce.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Selifan!" he exclaimed, leaning forward in the britchka.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it, barin?" replied the coachman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you see the country house anywhere?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, barin." After which, with a flourish of the whip, the man broke into
 a sort of endless, drawling song. In that song everything had a place. By
 "everything" I mean both the various encouraging and stimulating cries
 with which Russian folk urge on their horses, and a random, unpremeditated
 selection of adjectives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile Chichikov began to notice that the britchka was swaying
 violently, and dealing him occasional bumps. Consequently he suspected
 that it had left the road and was being dragged over a ploughed field.
 Upon Selifan's mind there appeared to have dawned a similar inkling, for
 he had ceased to hold forth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You rascal, what road are you following?" inquired Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," retorted the coachman. "What can a man do at a time of
 night when the darkness won't let him even see his whip?" And as Selifan
 spoke the vehicle tilted to an angle which left Chichikov no choice but to
 hang on with hands and teeth. At length he realised the fact that Selifan
 was drunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop, stop, or you will upset us!" he shouted to the fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, barin," replied Selifan. "HOW could I upset you? To upset people
 is wrong. I know that very well, and should never dream of such conduct."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here he started to turn the vehicle round a little?and kept on doing
 so until the britchka capsized on to its side, and Chichikov landed in the
 mud on his hands and knees. Fortunately Selifan succeeded in stopping the
 horses, although they would have stopped of themselves, seeing that they
 were utterly worn out. This unforeseen catastrophe evidently astonished
 their driver. Slipping from the box, he stood resting his hands against
 the side of the britchka, while Chichikov tumbled and floundered about in
 the mud, in a vain endeavour to wriggle clear of the stuff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, you!" said Selifan meditatively to the britchka. "To think of
 upsetting us like this!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are as drunk as a lord!" exclaimed Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, barin. Drunk, indeed? Why, I know my manners too well. A word or
 two with a friend?that is all that I have taken. Any one may talk
 with a decent man when he meets him. There is nothing wrong in that. Also,
 we had a snack together. There is nothing wrong in a snack?especially
 a snack with a decent man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did I say to you when last you got drunk?" asked Chichikov. "Have
 you forgotten what I said then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, barin. HOW could I forget it? I know what is what, and know that
 it is not right to get drunk. All that I have been having is a word or two
 with a decent man, for the reason that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if I lay the whip about you, you'll know then how to talk to a
 decent fellow, I'll warrant!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As you please, barin," replied the complacent Selifan. "Should you whip
 me, you will whip me, and I shall have nothing to complain of. Why should
 you not whip me if I deserve it? 'Tis for you to do as you like. Whippings
 are necessary sometimes, for a peasant often plays the fool, and
 discipline ought to be maintained. If I have deserved it, beat me. Why
 should you not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This reasoning seemed, at the moment, irrefutable, and Chichikov said
 nothing more. Fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair, for
 from afar their ears caught the barking of a dog. Plucking up courage,
 Chichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted, and the horses to be
 urged forward; and since a Russian driver has at least this merit, that,
 owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place of eyesight,
 he can, if necessary, drive at random and yet reach a destination of some
 sort, Selifan succeeded, though powerless to discern a single object, in
 directing his steeds to a country house near by, and that with such a
 certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts had collided with a
 garden wall, and thereby made it clear that to proceed another pace was
 impossible, that he stopped. All that Chichikov could discern through the
 thick veil of pouring rain was something which resembled a verandah. So he
 dispatched Selifan to search for the entrance gates, and that process
 would have lasted indefinitely had it not been shortened by the
 circumstance that, in Russia, the place of a Swiss footman is frequently
 taken by watchdogs; of which animals a number now proclaimed the
 travellers' presence so loudly that Chichikov found himself forced to stop
 his ears. Next, a light gleamed in one of the windows, and filtered in a
 thin stream to the garden wall?thus revealing the whereabouts of the
 entrance gates; whereupon Selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the
 bolts of the house door were withdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure
 clad in a rough cloak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is that knocking? What have you come for?" shouted the hoarse voice
 of an elderly woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are travellers, good mother," said Chichikov. "Pray allow us to spend
 the night here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out upon you for a pair of gadabouts!" retorted the old woman. "A fine
 time of night to be arriving! We don't keep an hotel, mind you. This is a
 lady's residence."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what are we to do, mother? We have lost our way, and cannot spend the
 night out of doors in such weather."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, we cannot. The night is dark and cold," added Selifan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold your tongue, you fool!" exclaimed Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who ARE you, then?" inquired the old woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A dvorianin <small>12</small>, good mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somehow the word dvorianin seemed to give the old woman food for thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait a moment," she said, "and I will tell the mistress."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two minutes later she returned with a lantern in her hand, the gates were
 opened, and a light glimmered in a second window. Entering the courtyard,
 the britchka halted before a moderate-sized mansion. The darkness did not
 permit of very accurate observation being made, but, apparently, the
 windows only of one-half of the building were illuminated, while a
 quagmire in front of the door reflected the beams from the same. Meanwhile
 the rain continued to beat sonorously down upon the wooden roof, and could
 be heard trickling into a water butt; nor for a single moment did the dogs
 cease to bark with all the strength of their lungs. One of them, throwing
 up its head, kept venting a howl of such energy and duration that the
 animal seemed to be howling for a handsome wager; while another, cutting
 in between the yelpings of the first animal, kept restlessly reiterating,
 like a postman's bell, the notes of a very young puppy. Finally, an old
 hound which appeared to be gifted with a peculiarly robust temperament
 kept supplying the part of contrabasso, so that his growls resembled the
 rumbling of a bass singer when a chorus is in full cry, and the tenors are
 rising on tiptoe in their efforts to compass a particularly high note, and
 the whole body of choristers are wagging their heads before approaching a
 climax, and this contrabasso alone is tucking his bearded chin into his
 collar, and sinking almost to a squatting posture on the floor, in order
 to produce a note which shall cause the windows to shiver and their panes
 to crack. Naturally, from a canine chorus of such executants it might
 reasonably be inferred that the establishment was one of the utmost
 respectability. To that, however, our damp, cold hero gave not a thought,
 for all his mind was fixed upon bed. Indeed, the britchka had hardly come
 to a standstill before he leapt out upon the doorstep, missed his footing,
 and came within an ace of falling. To meet him there issued a female
 younger than the first, but very closely resembling her; and on his being
 conducted to the parlour, a couple of glances showed him that the room was
 hung with old striped curtains, and ornamented with pictures of birds and
 small, antique mirrors?the latter set in dark frames which were
 carved to resemble scrolls of foliage. Behind each mirror was stuck either
 a letter or an old pack of cards or a stocking, while on the wall hung a
 clock with a flowered dial. More, however, Chichikov could not discern,
 for his eyelids were as heavy as though smeared with treacle. Presently
 the lady of the house herself entered?an elderly woman in a sort of
 nightcap (hastily put on) and a flannel neck wrap. She belonged to that
 class of lady landowners who are for ever lamenting failures of the
 harvest and their losses thereby; to the class who, drooping their heads
 despondently, are all the while stuffing money into striped purses, which
 they keep hoarded in the drawers of cupboards. Into one purse they will
 stuff rouble pieces, into another half roubles, and into a third
 tchetvertachki <small>13</small>, although from their mien you
 would suppose that the cupboard contained only linen and nightshirts and
 skeins of wool and the piece of shabby material which is destined?should
 the old gown become scorched during the baking of holiday cakes and other
 dainties, or should it fall into pieces of itself?to become
 converted into a new dress. But the gown never does get burnt or wear out,
 for the reason that the lady is too careful; wherefore the piece of shabby
 material reposes in its unmade-up condition until the priest advises that
 it be given to the niece of some widowed sister, together with a quantity
 of other such rubbish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov apologised for having disturbed the household with his
 unexpected arrival.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all, not at all," replied the lady. "But in what dreadful weather
 God has brought you hither! What wind and what rain! You could not help
 losing your way. Pray excuse us for being unable to make better
 preparations for you at this time of night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly there broke in upon the hostess' words the sound of a strange
 hissing, a sound so loud that the guest started in alarm, and the more so
 seeing that it increased until the room seemed filled with adders. On
 glancing upwards, however, he recovered his composure, for he perceived
 the sound to be emanating from the clock, which appeared to be in a mind
 to strike. To the hissing sound there succeeded a wheezing one, until,
 putting forth its best efforts, the thing struck two with as much clatter
 as though some one had been hitting an iron pot with a cudgel. That done,
 the pendulum returned to its right-left, right-left oscillation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov thanked his hostess kindly, and said that he needed nothing, and
 she must not put herself about: only for rest was he longing?though
 also he should like to know whither he had arrived, and whether the
 distance to the country house of land-owner Sobakevitch was anything very
 great. To this the lady replied that she had never so much as heard the
 name, since no gentleman of the name resided in the locality.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But at least you are acquainted with landowner Manilov?" continued
 Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Who is he?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Another landed proprietor, madam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, neither have I heard of him. No such landowner lives hereabouts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then who ARE your local landowners?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bobrov, Svinin, Kanapatiev, Khapakin, Trepakin, and Plieshakov."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they rich men?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, none of them. One of them may own twenty souls, and another thirty,
 but of gentry who own a hundred there are none."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov reflected that he had indeed fallen into an aristocratic
 wilderness!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At all events, is the town far away?" he inquired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About sixty versts. How sorry I am that I have nothing for you to eat!
 Should you care to drink some tea?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thank you, good mother, but I require nothing beyond a bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, after such a journey you must indeed be needing rest, so you shall
 lie upon this sofa. Fetinia, bring a quilt and some pillows and sheets.
 What weather God has sent us! And what dreadful thunder! Ever since sunset
 I have had a candle burning before the ikon in my bedroom. My God! Why,
 your back and sides are as muddy as a boar's! However have you managed to
 get into such a state?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That I am nothing worse than muddy is indeed fortunate, since, but for
 the Almighty, I should have had my ribs broken."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear, dear! To think of all that you must have been through. Had I not
 better wipe your back?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thank you, I thank you, but you need not trouble. Merely be so good as
 to tell your maid to dry my clothes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you hear that, Fetinia?" said the hostess, turning to a woman who was
 engaged in dragging in a feather bed and deluging the room with feathers.
 "Take this coat and this vest, and, after drying them before the fire?just
 as we used to do for your late master?give them a good rub, and fold
 them up neatly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, mistress," said Fetinia, spreading some sheets over the bed,
 and arranging the pillows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now your bed is ready for you," said the hostess to Chichikov.
 "Good-night, dear sir. I wish you good-night. Is there anything else that
 you require? Perhaps you would like to have your heels tickled before
 retiring to rest? Never could my late husband get to sleep without that
 having been done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the guest declined the proffered heel-tickling, and, on his hostess
 taking her departure, hastened to divest himself of his clothing, both
 upper and under, and to hand the garments to Fetinia. She wished him
 good-night, and removed the wet trappings; after which he found himself
 alone. Not without satisfaction did he eye his bed, which reached almost
 to the ceiling. Clearly Fetinia was a past mistress in the art of beating
 up such a couch, and, as the result, he had no sooner mounted it with the
 aid of a chair than it sank well-nigh to the floor, and the feathers,
 squeezed out of their proper confines, flew hither and thither into every
 corner of the apartment. Nevertheless he extinguished the candle, covered
 himself over with the chintz quilt, snuggled down beneath it, and
 instantly fell asleep. Next day it was late in the morning before he
 awoke. Through the window the sun was shining into his eyes, and the flies
 which, overnight, had been roosting quietly on the walls and ceiling now
 turned their attention to the visitor. One settled on his lip, another on
 his ear, a third hovered as though intending to lodge in his very eye, and
 a fourth had the temerity to alight just under his nostrils. In his drowsy
 condition he inhaled the latter insect, sneezed violently, and so returned
 to consciousness. He glanced around the room, and perceived that not all
 the pictures were representative of birds, since among them hung also a
 portrait of Kutuzov <small>14</small> and an oil painting of an old
 man in a uniform with red facings such as were worn in the days of the
 Emperor Paul <small>15</small>. At this moment the clock
 uttered its usual hissing sound, and struck ten, while a woman's face
 peered in at the door, but at once withdrew, for the reason that, with the
 object of sleeping as well as possible, Chichikov had removed every stitch
 of his clothing. Somehow the face seemed to him familiar, and he set
 himself to recall whose it could be. At length he recollected that it was
 the face of his hostess. His clothes he found lying, clean and dry, beside
 him; so he dressed and approached the mirror, meanwhile sneezing again
 with such vehemence that a cock which happened at the moment to be near
 the window (which was situated at no great distance from the ground)
 chuckled a short, sharp phrase. Probably it meant, in the bird's alien
 tongue, "Good morning to you!" Chichikov retorted by calling the bird a
 fool, and then himself approached the window to look at the view. It
 appeared to comprise a poulterer's premises. At all events, the narrow
 yard in front of the window was full of poultry and other domestic
 creatures?of game fowls and barn door fowls, with, among them, a
 cock which strutted with measured gait, and kept shaking its comb, and
 tilting its head as though it were trying to listen to something. Also, a
 sow and her family were helping to grace the scene. First, she rooted
 among a heap of litter; then, in passing, she ate up a young pullet;
 lastly, she proceeded carelessly to munch some pieces of melon rind. To
 this small yard or poultry-run a length of planking served as a fence,
 while beyond it lay a kitchen garden containing cabbages, onions,
 potatoes, beetroots, and other household vegetables. Also, the garden
 contained a few stray fruit trees that were covered with netting to
 protect them from the magpies and sparrows; flocks of which were even then
 wheeling and darting from one spot to another. For the same reason a
 number of scarecrows with outstretched arms stood reared on long poles,
 with, surmounting one of the figures, a cast-off cap of the hostess's.
 Beyond the garden again there stood a number of peasants' huts. Though
 scattered, instead of being arranged in regular rows, these appeared to
 Chichikov's eye to comprise well-to-do inhabitants, since all rotten
 planks in their roofing had been replaced with new ones, and none of their
 doors were askew, and such of their tiltsheds as faced him evinced
 evidence of a presence of a spare waggon?in some cases almost a new
 one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This lady owns by no means a poor village," said Chichikov to himself;
 wherefore he decided then and there to have a talk with his hostess, and
 to cultivate her closer acquaintance. Accordingly he peeped through the
 chink of the door whence her head had recently protruded, and, on seeing
 her seated at a tea table, entered and greeted her with a cheerful, kindly
 smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good morning, dear sir," she responded as she rose. "How have you slept?"
 She was dressed in better style than she had been on the previous evening.
 That is to say, she was now wearing a gown of some dark colour, and lacked
 her nightcap, and had swathed her neck in something stiff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have slept exceedingly well," replied Chichikov, seating himself upon a
 chair. "And how are YOU, good madam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But poorly, my dear sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I cannot sleep. A pain has taken me in my middle, and my legs,
 from the ankles upwards, are aching as though they were broken."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That will pass, that will pass, good mother. You must pay no attention to
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God grant that it MAY pass. However, I have been rubbing myself with lard
 and turpentine. What sort of tea will you take? In this jar I have some of
 the scented kind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Excellent, good mother! Then I will take that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Probably the reader will have noticed that, for all his expressions of
 solicitude, Chichikov's tone towards his hostess partook of a freer, a
 more unceremonious, nature than that which he had adopted towards Madam
 Manilov. And here I should like to assert that, howsoever much, in certain
 respects, we Russians may be surpassed by foreigners, at least we surpass
 them in adroitness of manner. In fact the various shades and subtleties of
 our social intercourse defy enumeration. A Frenchman or a German would be
 incapable of envisaging and understanding all its peculiarities and
 differences, for his tone in speaking to a millionaire differs but little
 from that which he employs towards a small tobacconist?and that in
 spite of the circumstance that he is accustomed to cringe before the
 former. With us, however, things are different. In Russian society there
 exist clever folk who can speak in one manner to a landowner possessed of
 two hundred peasant souls, and in another to a landowner possessed of
 three hundred, and in another to a landowner possessed of five hundred. In
 short, up to the number of a million souls the Russian will have ready for
 each landowner a suitable mode of address. For example, suppose that
 somewhere there exists a government office, and that in that office there
 exists a director. I would beg of you to contemplate him as he sits among
 his myrmidons. Sheer nervousness will prevent you from uttering a word in
 his presence, so great are the pride and superiority depicted on his
 countenance. Also, were you to sketch him, you would be sketching a
 veritable Prometheus, for his glance is as that of an eagle, and he walks
 with measured, stately stride. Yet no sooner will the eagle have left the
 room to seek the study of his superior officer than he will go scurrying
 along (papers held close to his nose) like any partridge. But in society,
 and at the evening party (should the rest of those present be of lesser
 rank than himself) the Prometheus will once more become Prometheus, and
 the man who stands a step below him will treat him in a way never dreamt
 of by Ovid, seeing that each fly is of lesser account than its superior
 fly, and becomes, in the presence of the latter, even as a grain of sand.
 "Surely that is not Ivan Petrovitch?" you will say of such and such a man
 as you regard him. "Ivan Petrovitch is tall, whereas this man is small and
 spare. Ivan Petrovitch has a loud, deep voice, and never smiles, whereas
 this man (whoever he may be) is twittering like a sparrow, and smiling all
 the time." Yet approach and take a good look at the fellow and you will
 see that is IS Ivan Petrovitch. "Alack, alack!" will be the only remark
 you can make.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let us return to our characters in real life. We have seen that, on this
 occasion, Chichikov decided to dispense with ceremony; wherefore, taking
 up the teapot, he went on as follows:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have a nice little village here, madam. How many souls does it
 contain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little less than eighty, dear sir. But the times are hard, and I have
 lost a great deal through last year's harvest having proved a failure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But your peasants look fine, strong fellows. May I enquire your name?
 Through arriving so late at night I have quite lost my wits."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Korobotchka, the widow of a Collegiate Secretary."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I humbly thank you. And your Christian name and patronymic?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nastasia Petrovna."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nastasia Petrovna! Those are excellent names. I have a maternal aunt
 named like yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And YOUR name?" queried the lady. "May I take it that you are a
 Government Assessor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, madam," replied Chichikov with a smile. "I am not an Assessor, but a
 traveller on private business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you must be a buyer of produce? How I regret that I have sold my
 honey so cheaply to other buyers! Otherwise YOU might have bought it, dear
 sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never buy honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then WHAT do you buy, pray? Hemp? I have a little of that by me, but not
 more than half a pood <small>16</small> or so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, madam. It is in other wares that I deal. Tell me, have you, of late
 years, lost many of your peasants by death?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; no fewer than eighteen," responded the old lady with a sigh. "Such a
 fine lot, too?all good workers! True, others have since grown up,
 but of what use are THEY? Mere striplings. When the Assessor last called
 upon me I could have wept; for, though those workmen of mine are dead, I
 have to keep on paying for them as though they were still alive! And only
 last week my blacksmith got burnt to death! Such a clever hand at his
 trade he was!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? A fire occurred at your place?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, God preserve us all! It was not so bad as that. You must
 understand that the blacksmith SET HIMSELF on fire?he got set on
 fire in his bowels through overdrinking. Yes, all of a sudden there burst
 from him a blue flame, and he smouldered and smouldered until he had
 turned as black as a piece of charcoal! Yet what a clever blacksmith he
 was! And now I have no horses to drive out with, for there is no one to
 shoe them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In everything the will of God, madam," said Chichikov with a sigh.
 "Against the divine wisdom it is not for us to rebel. Pray hand them over
 to me, Nastasia Petrovna."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hand over whom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The dead peasants."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how could I do that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite simply. Sell them to me, and I will give you some money in
 exchange."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how am I to sell them to you? I scarcely understand what you mean. Am
 I to dig them up again from the ground?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov perceived that the old lady was altogether at sea, and that he
 must explain the matter; wherefore in a few words he informed her that the
 transfer or purchase of the souls in question would take place merely on
 paper?that the said souls would be listed as still alive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what good would they be to you?" asked his hostess, staring at him
 with her eyes distended.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is MY affair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But they are DEAD souls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who said they were not? The mere fact of their being dead entails upon
 you a loss as dead as the souls, for you have to continue paying tax upon
 them, whereas MY plan is to relieve you both of the tax and of the
 resultant trouble. NOW do you understand? And I will not only do as I say,
 but also hand you over fifteen roubles per soul. Is that clear enough?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but I do not know," said his hostess diffidently. "You see,
 never before have I sold dead souls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so. It would be a surprising thing if you had. But surely you do
 not think that these dead souls are in the least worth keeping?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, indeed! Why should they be worth keeping? I am sure they are not
 so. The only thing which troubles me is the fact that they are DEAD."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She seems a truly obstinate old woman!" was Chichikov's inward comment.
 "Look here, madam," he added aloud. "You reason well, but you are simply
 ruining yourself by continuing to pay the tax upon dead souls as though
 they were still alive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, good sir, do not speak of it!" the lady exclaimed. "Three weeks ago I
 took a hundred and fifty roubles to that Assessor, and buttered him up,
 and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you see how it is, do you not? Remember that, according to my plan,
 you will never again have to butter up the Assessor, seeing that it will
 be I who will be paying for those peasants?<i>I</i>, not YOU, for I
 shall have taken over the dues upon them, and have transferred them to
 myself as so many bona fide serfs. Do you understand AT LAST?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, the old lady still communed with herself. She could see that the
 transaction would be to her advantage, yet it was one of such a novel and
 unprecedented nature that she was beginning to fear lest this purchaser of
 souls intended to cheat her. Certainly he had come from God only knew
 where, and at the dead of night, too!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, sir, I have never in my life sold dead folk?only living ones.
 Three years ago I transferred two wenches to Protopopov for a hundred
 roubles apiece, and he thanked me kindly, for they turned out splendid
 workers?able to make napkins or anything else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but with the living we have nothing to do, damn it! I am asking you
 only about DEAD folk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, of course. But at first sight I felt afraid lest I should be
 incurring a loss?lest you should be wishing to outwit me, good sir.
 You see, the dead souls are worth rather more than you have offered for
 them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See here, madam. (What a woman it is!) HOW could they be worth more?
 Think for yourself. They are so much loss to you?so much loss, do
 you understand? Take any worthless, rubbishy article you like?a
 piece of old rag, for example. That rag will yet fetch its price, for it
 can be bought for paper-making. But these dead souls are good for NOTHING
 AT ALL. Can you name anything that they ARE good for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True, true?they ARE good for nothing. But what troubles me is the
 fact that they are dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a blockhead of a creature!" said Chichikov to himself, for he was
 beginning to lose patience. "Bless her heart, I may as well be going. She
 has thrown me into a perfect sweat, the cursed old shrew!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the perspiration from
 his brow. Yet he need not have flown into such a passion. More than one
 respected statesman reveals himself, when confronted with a business
 matter, to be just such another as Madam Korobotchka, in that, once he has
 got an idea into his head, there is no getting it out of him?you may
 ply him with daylight-clear arguments, yet they will rebound from his
 brain as an india-rubber ball rebounds from a flagstone. Nevertheless,
 wiping away the perspiration, Chichikov resolved to try whether he could
 not bring her back to the road by another path.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Madam," he said, "either you are declining to understand what I say or
 you are talking for the mere sake of talking. If I hand you over some
 money?fifteen roubles for each soul, do you understand??it is
 MONEY, not something which can be picked up haphazard on the street. For
 instance, tell me how much you sold your honey for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For twelve roubles per pood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Then by those words, madam, you have laid a trifling sin upon your
 soul; for you did NOT sell the honey for twelve roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By the Lord God I did!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, well! Never mind. Honey is only honey. Now, you had collected that
 stuff, it may be, for a year, and with infinite care and labour. You had
 fussed after it, you had trotted to and fro, you had duly frozen out the
 bees, and you had fed them in the cellar throughout the winter. But these
 dead souls of which I speak are quite another matter, for in this case you
 have put forth no exertions?it was merely God's will that they
 should leave the world, and thus decrease the personnel of your
 establishment. In the former case you received (so you allege) twelve
 roubles per pood for your labour; but in this case you will receive money
 for having done nothing at all. Nor will you receive twelve roubles per
 item, but FIFTEEN?and roubles not in silver, but roubles in good
 paper currency."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That these powerful inducements would certainly cause the old woman to
 yield Chichikov had not a doubt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True," his hostess replied. "But how strangely business comes to me as a
 widow! Perhaps I had better wait a little longer, seeing that other buyers
 might come along, and I might be able to compare prices."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For shame, madam! For shame! Think what you are saying. Who else, I would
 ask, would care to buy those souls? What use could they be to any one?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If that is so, they might come in useful to ME," mused the old woman
 aloud; after which she sat staring at Chichikov with her mouth open and a
 face of nervous expectancy as to his possible rejoinder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dead folk useful in a household!" he exclaimed. "Why, what could you do
 with them? Set them up on poles to frighten away the sparrows from your
 garden?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The Lord save us, but what things you say!" she ejaculated, crossing
 herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, WHAT could you do with them? By this time they are so much bones
 and earth. That is all there is left of them. Their transfer to myself
 would be ON PAPER only. Come, come! At least give me an answer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the old woman communed with herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you thinking of, Nastasia Petrovna?" inquired Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am thinking that I scarcely know what to do. Perhaps I had better sell
 you some hemp?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do I want with hemp? Pardon me, but just when I have made to you a
 different proposal altogether you begin fussing about hemp! Hemp is hemp,
 and though I may want some when I NEXT visit you, I should like to know
 what you have to say to the suggestion under discussion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I think it a very queer bargain. Never have I heard of such a
 thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this Chichikov lost all patience, upset his chair, and bid her go to
 the devil; of which personage even the mere mention terrified her
 extremely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not speak of him, I beg of you!" she cried, turning pale. "May God,
 rather, bless him! Last night was the third night that he has appeared to
 me in a dream. You see, after saying my prayers, I bethought me of telling
 my fortune by the cards; and God must have sent him as a punishment. He
 looked so horrible, and had horns longer than a bull's!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder you don't see SCORES of devils in your dreams! Merely out of
 Christian charity he had come to you to say, 'I perceive a poor widow
 going to rack and ruin, and likely soon to stand in danger of want.' Well,
 go to rack and ruin?yes, you and all your village together!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The insults!" exclaimed the old woman, glancing at her visitor in terror.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think so!" continued Chichikov. "Indeed, I cannot find words to
 describe you. To say no more about it, you are like a dog in a manger. You
 don't want to eat the hay yourself, yet you won't let anyone else touch
 it. All that I am seeking to do is to purchase certain domestic products
 of yours, for the reason that I have certain Government contracts to
 fulfil." This last he added in passing, and without any ulterior motive,
 save that it came to him as a happy thought. Nevertheless the mention of
 Government contracts exercised a powerful influence upon Nastasia
 Petrovna, and she hastened to say in a tone that was almost supplicatory:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why should you be so angry with me? Had I known that you were going to
 lose your temper in this way, I should never have discussed the matter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No wonder that I lose my temper! An egg too many is no great matter, yet
 it may prove exceedingly annoying."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, well, I will let you have the souls for fifteen roubles each. Also,
 with regard to those contracts, do not forget me if at any time you should
 find yourself in need of rye-meal or buckwheat or groats or dead meat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I shall NEVER forget you, madam!" he said, wiping his forehead, where
 three separate streams of perspiration were trickling down his face. Then
 he asked her whether in the town she had any acquaintance or agent whom
 she could empower to complete the transference of the serfs, and to carry
 out whatsoever else might be necessary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly," replied Madame Korobotchka. "The son of our archpriest,
 Father Cyril, himself is a lawyer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that Chichikov begged her to accord the gentleman in question a power
 of attorney, while, to save extra trouble, he himself would then and there
 compose the requisite letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would be a fine thing if he were to buy up all my meal and stock for
 the Government," thought Madame to herself. "I must encourage him a
 little. There has been some dough standing ready since last night, so I
 will go and tell Fetinia to try a few pancakes. Also, it might be well to
 try him with an egg pie. We make then nicely here, and they do not take
 long in the making."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she departed to translate her thoughts into action, as well as to
 supplement the pie with other products of the domestic cuisine; while, for
 his part, Chichikov returned to the drawing-room where he had spent the
 night, in order to procure from his dispatch-box the necessary
 writing-paper. The room had now been set in order, the sumptuous feather
 bed removed, and a table set before the sofa. Depositing his dispatch-box
 upon the table, he heaved a gentle sigh on becoming aware that he was so
 soaked with perspiration that he might almost have been dipped in a river.
 Everything, from his shirt to his socks, was dripping. "May she starve to
 death, the cursed old harridan!" he ejaculated after a moment's rest. Then
 he opened his dispatch-box. In passing, I may say that I feel certain that
 at least SOME of my readers will be curious to know the contents and the
 internal arrangements of that receptacle. Why should I not gratify their
 curiosity? To begin with, the centre of the box contained a soap-dish,
 with, disposed around it, six or seven compartments for razors. Next came
 square partitions for a sand-box <small>17</small> and an
 inkstand, as well as (scooped out in their midst) a hollow of pens,
 sealing-wax, and anything else that required more room. Lastly there were
 all sorts of little divisions, both with and without lids, for articles of
 a smaller nature, such as visiting cards, memorial cards, theatre tickets,
 and things which Chichikov had laid by as souvenirs. This portion of the
 box could be taken out, and below it were both a space for manuscripts and
 a secret money-box?the latter made to draw out from the side of the
 receptacle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov set to work to clean a pen, and then to write. Presently his
 hostess entered the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a beautiful box you have got, my dear sir!" she exclaimed as she
 took a seat beside him. "Probably you bought it in Moscow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?in Moscow," replied Chichikov without interrupting his writing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought so. One CAN get good things there. Three years ago my sister
 brought me a few pairs of warm shoes for my sons, and they were such
 excellent articles! To this day my boys wear them. And what nice stamped
 paper you have!" (she had peered into the dispatch-box, where, sure
 enough, there lay a further store of the paper in question). "Would you
 mind letting me have a sheet of it? I am without any at all, although I
 shall soon have to be presenting a plea to the land court, and possess not
 a morsel of paper to write it on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this Chichikov explained that the paper was not the sort proper for
 the purpose?that it was meant for serf-indenturing, and not for the
 framing of pleas. Nevertheless, to quiet her, he gave her a sheet stamped
 to the value of a rouble. Next, he handed her the letter to sign, and
 requested, in return, a list of her peasants. Unfortunately, such a list
 had never been compiled, let alone any copies of it, and the only way in
 which she knew the peasants' names was by heart. However, he told her to
 dictate them. Some of the names greatly astonished our hero, so, still
 more, did the surnames. Indeed, frequently, on hearing the latter, he had
 to pause before writing them down. Especially did he halt before a certain
 "Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito." "What a string of titles!"
 involuntarily he ejaculated. To the Christian name of another serf was
 appended "Korovi Kirpitch," and to that of a third "Koleso Ivan." However,
 at length the list was compiled, and he caught a deep breath; which latter
 proceeding caused him to catch also the attractive odour of something
 fried in fat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beseech you to have a morsel," murmured his hostess. Chichikov looked
 up, and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms, pies, and other
 viands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Try this freshly-made pie and an egg," continued Madame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov did so, and having eaten more than half of what she offered him,
 praised the pie highly. Indeed, it was a toothsome dish, and, after his
 difficulties and exertions with his hostess, it tasted even better than it
 might otherwise have done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And also a few pancakes?" suggested Madame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer Chichikov folded three together, and, having dipped them in
 melted butter, consigned the lot to his mouth, and then wiped his mouth
 with a napkin. Twice more was the process repeated, and then he requested
 his hostess to order the britchka to be got ready. In dispatching Fetinia
 with the necessary instructions, she ordered her to return with a second
 batch of hot pancakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your pancakes are indeed splendid," said Chichikov, applying himself to
 the second consignment of fried dainties when they had arrived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, we make them well here," replied Madame. "Yet how unfortunate it is
 that the harvest should have proved so poor as to have prevented me from
 earning anything on my?But why should you be in such a hurry to
 depart, good sir?" She broke off on seeing Chichikov reach for his cap.
 "The britchka is not yet ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it is being got so, madam, it is being got so, and I shall need a
 moment or two to pack my things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As you please, dear sir; but do not forget me in connection with those
 Government contracts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I have said that NEVER shall I forget you," replied Chichikov as he
 hurried into the hall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And would you like to buy some lard?" continued his hostess, pursuing
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lard? Oh certainly. Why not? Only, only?I will do so ANOTHER time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall have some ready at about Christmas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so, madam. THEN I will buy anything and everything?the lard
 included."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And perhaps you will be wanting also some feathers? I shall be having
 some for sale about St. Philip's Day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, very well, madam."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There you see!" she remarked as they stepped out on to the verandah. "The
 britchka is NOT yet ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it soon will be, it soon will be. Only direct me to the main road."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How am I to do that?" said Madame. "'Twould puzzle a wise man to do so,
 for in these parts there are so many turnings. However, I will send a girl
 to guide you. You could find room for her on the box-seat, could you not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, of course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I will send her. She knows the way thoroughly. Only do not carry her
 off for good. Already some traders have deprived me of one of my girls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov reassured his hostess on the point, and Madame plucked up
 courage enough to scan, first of all, the housekeeper, who happened to be
 issuing from the storehouse with a bowl of honey, and, next, a young
 peasant who happened to be standing at the gates; and, while thus engaged,
 she became wholly absorbed in her domestic pursuits. But why pay her so
 much attention? The Widow Korobotchka, Madame Manilov, domestic life,
 non-domestic life?away with them all! How strangely are things
 compounded! In a trice may joy turn to sorrow, should one halt long enough
 over it: in a trice only God can say what ideas may strike one. You may
 fall even to thinking: "After all, did Madame Korobotchka stand so very
 low in the scale of human perfection? Was there really such a very great
 gulf between her and Madame Manilov?between her and the Madame
 Manilov whom we have seen entrenched behind the walls of a genteel mansion
 in which there were a fine staircase of wrought metal and a number of rich
 carpets; the Madame Manilov who spent most of her time in yawning behind
 half-read books, and in hoping for a visit from some socially
 distinguished person in order that she might display her wit and carefully
 rehearsed thoughts?thoughts which had been de rigeur in town for a
 week past, yet which referred, not to what was going on in her household
 or on her estate?both of which properties were at odds and ends,
 owing to her ignorance of the art of managing them?but to the coming
 political revolution in France and the direction in which fashionable
 Catholicism was supposed to be moving? But away with such things! Why need
 we speak of them? Yet how comes it that suddenly into the midst of our
 careless, frivolous, unthinking moments there may enter another, and a
 very different, tendency??that the smile may not have left a human
 face before its owner will have radically changed his or her nature
 (though not his or her environment) with the result that the face will
 suddenly become lit with a radiance never before seen there?...
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is the britchka, here is the britchka!" exclaimed Chichikov on
 perceiving that vehicle slowly advancing. "Ah, you blockhead!" he went on
 to Selifan. "Why have you been loitering about? I suppose last night's
 fumes have not yet left your brain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this Selifan returned no reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, madam," added the speaker. "But where is the girl whom you
 promised me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, Pelagea!" called the hostess to a wench of about eleven who was
 dressed in home-dyed garments and could boast of a pair of bare feet
 which, from a distance, might almost have been mistaken for boots, so
 encrusted were they with fresh mire. "Here, Pelagea! Come and show this
 gentleman the way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Selifan helped the girl to ascend to the box-seat. Placing one foot upon
 the step by which the gentry mounted, she covered the said step with mud,
 and then, ascending higher, attained the desired position beside the
 coachman. Chichikov followed in her wake (causing the britchka to heel
 over with his weight as he did so), and then settled himself back into his
 place with an "All right! Good-bye, madam!" as the horses moved away at a
 trot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Selifan looked gloomy as he drove, but also very attentive to his
 business. This was invariably his custom when he had committed the fault
 of getting drunk. Also, the horses looked unusually well-groomed. In
 particular, the collar on one of them had been neatly mended, although
 hitherto its state of dilapidation had been such as perennially to allow
 the stuffing to protrude through the leather. The silence preserved was
 well-nigh complete. Merely flourishing his whip, Selifan spoke to the team
 no word of instruction, although the skewbald was as ready as usual to
 listen to conversation of a didactic nature, seeing that at such times the
 reins hung loosely in the hands of the loquacious driver, and the whip
 wandered merely as a matter of form over the backs of the troika. This
 time, however, there could be heard issuing from Selifan's sullen lips
 only the uniformly unpleasant exclamation, "Now then, you brutes! Get on
 with you, get on with you!" The bay and the Assessor too felt put out at
 not hearing themselves called "my pets" or "good lads"; while, in
 addition, the skewbald came in for some nasty cuts across his sleek and
 ample quarters. "What has put master out like this?" thought the animal as
 it shook its head. "Heaven knows where he does not keep beating me?across
 the back, and even where I am tenderer still. Yes, he keeps catching the
 whip in my ears, and lashing me under the belly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the right, eh?" snapped Selifan to the girl beside him as he pointed
 to a rain-soaked road which trended away through fresh green fields.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no," she replied. "I will show you the road when the time comes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which way, then?" he asked again when they had proceeded a little
 further.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This way." And she pointed to the road just mentioned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get along with you!" retorted the coachman. "That DOES go to the right.
 You don't know your right hand from your left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The weather was fine, but the ground so excessively sodden that the wheels
 of the britchka collected mire until they had become caked as with a layer
 of felt, a circumstance which greatly increased the weight of the vehicle,
 and prevented it from clearing the neighbouring parishes before the
 afternoon was arrived. Also, without the girl's help the finding of the
 way would have been impossible, since roads wiggled away in every
 direction, like crabs released from a net, and, but for the assistance
 mentioned, Selifan would have found himself left to his own devices.
 Presently she pointed to a building ahead, with the words, "THERE is the
 main road."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what is the building?" asked Selifan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A tavern," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then we can get along by ourselves," he observed. "Do you get down, and
 be off home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that he stopped, and helped her to alight?muttering as he did
 so: "Ah, you blackfooted creature!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov added a copper groat, and she departed well pleased with her
 ride in the gentleman's carriage.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV
 </h2>
 <p>
 On reaching the tavern, Chichikov called a halt. His reasons for this were
 twofold?namely, that he wanted to rest the horses, and that he
 himself desired some refreshment. In this connection the author feels
 bound to confess that the appetite and the capacity of such men are
 greatly to be envied. Of those well-to-do folk of St. Petersburg and
 Moscow who spend their time in considering what they shall eat on the
 morrow, and in composing a dinner for the day following, and who never sit
 down to a meal without first of all injecting a pill and then swallowing
 oysters and crabs and a quantity of other monsters, while eternally
 departing for Karlsbad or the Caucasus, the author has but a small
 opinion. Yes, THEY are not the persons to inspire envy. Rather, it is the
 folk of the middle classes?folk who at one posthouse call for bacon,
 and at another for a sucking pig, and at a third for a steak of sturgeon
 or a baked pudding with onions, and who can sit down to table at any hour,
 as though they had never had a meal in their lives, and can devour fish of
 all sorts, and guzzle and chew it with a view to provoking further
 appetite?these, I say, are the folk who enjoy heaven's most favoured
 gift. To attain such a celestial condition the great folk of whom I have
 spoken would sacrifice half their serfs and half their mortgaged and
 non-mortgaged property, with the foreign and domestic improvements
 thereon, if thereby they could compass such a stomach as is possessed by
 the folk of the middle class. But, unfortunately, neither money nor real
 estate, whether improved or non-improved, can purchase such a stomach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little wooden tavern, with its narrow, but hospitable, curtain
 suspended from a pair of rough-hewn doorposts like old church
 candlesticks, seemed to invite Chichikov to enter. True, the establishment
 was only a Russian hut of the ordinary type, but it was a hut of larger
 dimensions than usual, and had around its windows and gables carved and
 patterned cornices of bright-coloured wood which threw into relief the
 darker hue of the walls, and consorted well with the flowered pitchers
 painted on the shutters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ascending the narrow wooden staircase to the upper floor, and arriving
 upon a broad landing, Chichikov found himself confronted with a creaking
 door and a stout old woman in a striped print gown. "This way, if you
 please," she said. Within the apartment designated Chichikov encountered
 the old friends which one invariably finds in such roadside hostelries?to
 wit, a heavy samovar, four smooth, bescratched walls of white pine, a
 three-cornered press with cups and teapots, egg-cups of gilded china
 standing in front of ikons suspended by blue and red ribands, a cat lately
 delivered of a family, a mirror which gives one four eyes instead of two
 and a pancake for a face, and, beside the ikons, some bunches of herbs and
 carnations of such faded dustiness that, should one attempt to smell them,
 one is bound to burst out sneezing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you a sucking-pig?" Chichikov inquired of the landlady as she stood
 expectantly before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And some horse-radish and sour cream?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then serve them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The landlady departed for the purpose, and returned with a plate, a napkin
 (the latter starched to the consistency of dried bark), a knife with a
 bone handle beginning to turn yellow, a two-pronged fork as thin as a
 wafer, and a salt-cellar incapable of being made to stand upright.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Following the accepted custom, our hero entered into conversation with the
 woman, and inquired whether she herself or a landlord kept the tavern; how
 much income the tavern brought in; whether her sons lived with her;
 whether the oldest was a bachelor or married; whom the eldest had taken to
 wife; whether the dowry had been large; whether the father-in-law had been
 satisfied, and whether the said father-in-law had not complained of
 receiving too small a present at the wedding. In short, Chichikov touched
 on every conceivable point. Likewise (of course) he displayed some
 curiosity as to the landowners of the neighbourhood. Their names, he
 ascertained, were Blochin, Potchitaev, Minoi, Cheprakov, and Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you are acquainted with Sobakevitch?" he said; whereupon the old
 woman informed him that she knew not only Sobakevitch, but also Manilov,
 and that the latter was the more delicate eater of the two, since, whereas
 Manilov always ordered a roast fowl and some veal and mutton, and then
 tasted merely a morsel of each, Sobakevitch would order one dish only, but
 consume the whole of it, and then demand more at the same price.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst Chichikov was thus conversing and partaking of the sucking pig
 until only a fragment of it seemed likely to remain, the sound of an
 approaching vehicle made itself heard. Peering through the window, he saw
 draw up to the tavern door a light britchka drawn by three fine horses.
 From it there descended two men?one flaxen-haired and tall, and the
 other dark-haired and of slighter build. While the flaxen-haired man was
 clad in a dark-blue coat, the other one was wrapped in a coat of striped
 pattern. Behind the britchka stood a second, but an empty, turn-out, drawn
 by four long-coated steeds in ragged collars and rope harnesses. The
 flaxen-haired man lost no time in ascending the staircase, while his
 darker friend remained below to fumble at something in the britchka,
 talking, as he did so, to the driver of the vehicle which stood hitched
 behind. Somehow, the dark-haired man's voice struck Chichikov as familiar;
 and as he was taking another look at him the flaxen-haired gentleman
 entered the room. The newcomer was a man of lofty stature, with a small
 red moustache and a lean, hard-bitten face whose redness made it evident
 that its acquaintance, if not with the smoke of gunpowder, at all events
 with that of tobacco, was intimate and extensive. Nevertheless he greeted
 Chichikov civilly, and the latter returned his bow. Indeed, the pair would
 have entered into conversation, and have made one another's acquaintance
 (since a beginning was made with their simultaneously expressing
 satisfaction at the circumstance that the previous night's rain had laid
 the dust on the roads, and thereby made driving cool and pleasant) when
 the gentleman's darker-favoured friend also entered the room, and,
 throwing his cap upon the table, pushed back a mass of dishevelled black
 locks from his brow. The latest arrival was a man of medium height, but
 well put together, and possessed of a pair of full red cheeks, a set of
 teeth as white as snow, and coal-black whiskers. Indeed, so fresh was his
 complexion that it seemed to have been compounded of blood and milk, while
 health danced in his every feature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha, ha, ha!" he cried with a gesture of astonishment at the sight of
 Chichikov. "What chance brings YOU here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that Chichikov recognised Nozdrev?the man whom he had met at
 dinner at the Public Prosecutor's, and who, within a minute or two of the
 introduction, had become so intimate with his fellow guest as to address
 him in the second person singular, in spite of the fact that Chichikov had
 given him no opportunity for doing so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where have you been to-day?" Nozdrev inquired, and, without waiting for
 an answer, went on: "For myself, I am just from the fair, and completely
 cleaned out. Actually, I have had to do the journey back with stage
 horses! Look out of the window, and see them for yourself." And he turned
 Chichikov's head so sharply in the desired direction that he came very
 near to bumping it against the window frame. "Did you ever see such a bag
 of tricks? The cursed things have only just managed to get here. In fact,
 on the way I had to transfer myself to this fellow's britchka." He
 indicated his companion with a finger. "By the way, don't you know one
 another? He is Mizhuev, my brother-in-law. He and I were talking of you
 only this morning. 'Just you see,' said I to him, 'if we do not fall in
 with Chichikov before we have done.' Heavens, how completely cleaned out I
 am! Not only have I lost four good horses, but also my watch and chain."
 Chichikov perceived that in very truth his interlocutor was minus the
 articles named, as well as that one of Nozdrev's whiskers was less bushy
 in appearance than the other one. "Had I had another twenty roubles in my
 pocket," went on Nozdrev, "I should have won back all that I have lost, as
 well as have pouched a further thirty thousand. Yes, I give you my word of
 honour on that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you were saying the same thing when last I met you," put in the
 flaxen-haired man. "Yet, even though I lent you fifty roubles, you lost
 them all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I should not have lost them THIS time. Don't try to make me out a
 fool. I should NOT have lost them, I tell you. Had I only played the right
 card, I should have broken the bank."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you did NOT break the bank," remarked the flaxen-haired man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. That was because I did not play my cards right. But what about your
 precious major's play? Is THAT good?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good or not, at least he beat you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Splendid of him! Nevertheless I will get my own back. Let him play me at
 doubles, and we shall soon see what sort of a player he is! Friend
 Chichikov, at first we had a glorious time, for the fair was a tremendous
 success. Indeed, the tradesmen said that never yet had there been such a
 gathering. I myself managed to sell everything from my estate at a good
 price. In fact, we had a magnificent time. I can't help thinking of it,
 devil take me! But what a pity YOU were not there! Three versts from the
 town there is quartered a regiment of dragoons, and you would scarcely
 believe what a lot of officers it has. Forty at least there are, and they
 do a fine lot of knocking about the town and drinking. In particular,
 Staff-Captain Potsieluev is a SPLENDID fellow! You should just see his
 moustache! Why, he calls good claret 'trash'! 'Bring me some of the usual
 trash,' is his way of ordering it. And Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov, too! He is
 as delightful as the other man. In fact, I may say that every one of the
 lot is a rake. I spent my whole time with them, and you can imagine that
 Ponomarev, the wine merchant, did a fine trade indeed! All the same, he is
 a rascal, you know, and ought not to be dealt with, for he puts all sorts
 of rubbish into his liquor?Indian wood and burnt cork and elderberry
 juice, the villain! Nevertheless, get him to produce a bottle from what he
 calls his 'special cellar,' and you will fancy yourself in the seventh
 heaven of delight. And what quantities of champagne we drank! Compared
 with it, provincial stuff is kvass <small>18</small>. Try to
 imagine not merely Clicquot, but a sort of blend of Clicquot and Matradura?Clicquot
 of double strength. Also Ponomarev produced a bottle of French stuff which
 he calls 'Bonbon.' Had it a bouquet, ask you? Why, it had the bouquet of a
 rose garden, of anything else you like. What times we had, to be sure!
 Just after we had left Pnomarev's place, some prince or another arrived in
 the town, and sent out for some champagne; but not a bottle was there
 left, for the officers had drunk every one! Why, I myself got through
 seventeen bottles at a sitting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come! You CAN'T have got through seventeen," remarked the
 flaxen-haired man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I did, I give my word of honour," retorted Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Imagine what you like, but you didn't drink even TEN bottles at a
 sitting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you bet that I did not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; for what would be the use of betting about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then at least wager the gun which you have bought."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I am not going to do anything of the kind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just as an experiment?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is as well for you that you don't, since, otherwise, you would have
 found yourself minus both gun and cap. However, friend Chichikov, it is a
 pity you were not there. Had you been there, I feel sure you would have
 found yourself unable to part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. You and he
 would have hit it off splendidly. You know, he is quite a different sort
 from the Public Prosecutor and our other provincial skinflints?fellows
 who shiver in their shoes before they will spend a single kopeck. HE will
 play faro, or anything else, and at any time. Why did you not come with
 us, instead of wasting your time on cattle breeding or something of the
 sort? But never mind. Embrace me. I like you immensely. Mizhuev, see how
 curiously things have turned out. Chichikov has nothing to do with me, or
 I with him, yet here is he come from God knows where, and landed in the
 very spot where I happen to be living! I may tell you that, no matter how
 many carriages I possessed, I should gamble the lot away. Recently I went
 in for a turn at billiards, and lost two jars of pomade, a china teapot,
 and a guitar. Then I staked some more things, and, like a fool, lost them
 all, and six roubles in addition. What a dog is that Kuvshinnikov! He and
 I attended nearly every ball in the place. In particular, there was a
 woman?decolletee, and such a swell! I merely thought to myself, 'The
 devil take her!' but Kuvshinnikov is such a wag that he sat down beside
 her, and began paying her strings of compliments in French. However, I did
 not neglect the damsels altogether?although HE calls that sort of
 thing 'going in for strawberries.' By the way, I have a splendid piece of
 fish and some caviare with me. 'Tis all I HAVE brought back! In fact it is
 a lucky chance that I happened to buy the stuff before my money was gone.
 Where are you for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am about to call on a friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On what friend? Let him go to the devil, and come to my place instead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot, I cannot. I have business to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, business again! I thought so!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I HAVE business to do?and pressing business at that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wager that you're lying. If not, tell me whom you're going to call
 upon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Upon Sobakevitch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Instantly Nozdrev burst into a laugh compassable only by a healthy man in
 whose head every tooth still remains as white as sugar. By this I mean the
 laugh of quivering cheeks, the laugh which causes a neighbour who is
 sleeping behind double doors three rooms away to leap from his bed and
 exclaim with distended eyes, "Hullo! Something HAS upset him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is there to laugh at?" asked Chichikov, a trifle nettled; but
 Nozdrev laughed more unrestrainedly than ever, ejaculating: "Oh, spare us
 all! The thing is so amusing that I shall die of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say that there is nothing to laugh at," repeated Chichikov. "It is in
 fulfilment of a promise that I am on my way to Sobakevitch's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you will scarcely be glad to be alive when you've got there, for he
 is the veriest miser in the countryside. Oh, <i>I</i> know you. However,
 if you think to find there either faro or a bottle of 'Bonbon' you are
 mistaken. Look here, my good friend. Let Sobakevitch go to the devil, and
 come to MY place, where at least I shall have a piece of sturgeon to offer
 you for dinner. Ponomarev said to me on parting: 'This piece is just the
 thing for you. Even if you were to search the whole market, you would
 never find a better one.' But of course he is a terrible rogue. I said to
 him outright: 'You and the Collector of Taxes are the two greatest
 skinflints in the town.' But he only stroked his beard and smiled. Every
 day I used to breakfast with Kuvshinnikov in his restaurant. Well, what I
 was nearly forgetting is this: that, though I am aware that you can't
 forgo your engagement, I am not going to give you up?no, not for ten
 thousand roubles of money. I tell you that in advance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here he broke off to run to the window and shout to his servant (who was
 holding a knife in one hand and a crust of bread and a piece of sturgeon
 in the other?he had contrived to filch the latter while fumbling in
 the britchka for something else):
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi, Porphyri! Bring here that puppy, you rascal! What a puppy it is!
 Unfortunately that thief of a landlord has given it nothing to eat, even
 though I have promised him the roan filly which, as you may remember, I
 swopped from Khvostirev." As a matter of act, Chichikov had never in his
 life seen either Khvostirev or the roan filly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Barin, do you wish for anything to eat?" inquired the landlady as she
 entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, nothing at all. Ah, friend Chichikov, what times we had! Yes, give me
 a glass of vodka, old woman. What sort to you keep?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aniseed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then bring me a glass of it," repeated Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And one for me as well," added the flaxen-haired man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At the theatre," went on Nozdrev, "there was an actress who sang like a
 canary. Kuvshinnikov, who happened to be sitting with me, said: 'My boy,
 you had better go and gather that strawberry.' As for the booths at the
 fair, they numbered, I should say, fifty." At this point he broke off to
 take the glass of vodka from the landlady, who bowed low in
 acknowledgement of his doing so. At the same moment Porphyri?a
 fellow dressed like his master (that is to say, in a greasy, wadded
 overcoat)?entered with the puppy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Put the brute down here," commanded Nozdrev, "and then fasten it up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Porphyri deposited the animal upon the floor; whereupon it proceeded to
 act after the manner of dogs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "THERE'S a puppy for you!" cried Nozdrev, catching hold of it by the back,
 and lifting it up. The puppy uttered a piteous yelp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can see that you haven't done what I told you to do," he continued to
 Porphyri after an inspection of the animal's belly. "You have quite
 forgotten to brush him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I DID brush him," protested Porphyri.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then where did these fleas come from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot think. Perhaps they have leapt into his coat out of the
 britchka."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You liar! As a matter of fact, you have forgotten to brush him.
 Nevertheless, look at these ears, Chichikov. Just feel them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why should I? Without doing that, I can see that he is well-bred."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless, catch hold of his ears and feel them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To humour the fellow Chichikov did as he had requested, remarking: "Yes,
 he seems likely to turn out well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And feel the coldness of his nose! Just take it in your hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not wishing to offend his interlocutor, Chichikov felt the puppy's nose,
 saying: "Some day he will have an excellent scent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, will he not? 'Tis the right sort of muzzle for that. I must say that
 I have long been wanting such a puppy. Porphyri, take him away again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Porphyri lifted up the puppy, and bore it downstairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, Chichikov," resumed Nozdrev. "You MUST come to my place. It
 lies only five versts away, and we can go there like the wind, and you can
 visit Sobakevitch afterwards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I, or shall I not, go to Nozdrev's?" reflected Chichikov. "Is he
 likely to prove any more useful than the rest? Well, at least he is as
 promising, even though he has lost so much at play. But he has a head on
 his shoulders, and therefore I must go carefully if I am to tackle him
 concerning my scheme."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that he added aloud: "Very well, I WILL come with you, but do not let
 us be long, for my time is very precious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's right, that's right!" cried Nozdrev. "Splendid, splendid! Let me
 embrace you!" And he fell upon Chichikov's neck. "All three of us will
 go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no," put in the flaxen-haired man. "You must excuse me, for I must be
 off home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rubbish, rubbish! I am NOT going to excuse you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But my wife will be furious with me. You and Monsieur Chichikov must
 change into the other britchka."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come! The thing is not to be thought of."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The flaxen-haired man was one of those people in whose character, at first
 sight, there seems to lurk a certain grain of stubbornness?so much
 so that, almost before one has begun to speak, they are ready to dispute
 one's words, and to disagree with anything that may be opposed to their
 peculiar form of opinion. For instance, they will decline to have folly
 called wisdom, or any tune danced to but their own. Always, however, will
 there become manifest in their character a soft spot, and in the end they
 will accept what hitherto they have denied, and call what is foolish
 sensible, and even dance?yes, better than any one else will do?to
 a tune set by some one else. In short, they generally begin well, but
 always end badly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rubbish!" said Nozdrev in answer to a further objection on his
 brother-in-law's part. And, sure enough, no sooner had Nozdrev clapped his
 cap upon his head than the flaxen-haired man started to follow him and his
 companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the gentleman has not paid for the vodka?" put in the old woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, all right, good mother. Look here, brother-in-law. Pay her,
 will you, for I have not a kopeck left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much?" inquired the brother-in-law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, sir? Eighty kopecks, if you please," replied the old woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A lie! Give her half a rouble. That will be quite enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it will NOT, barin," protested the old woman. However, she took the
 money gratefully, and even ran to the door to open it for the gentlemen.
 As a matter of fact, she had lost nothing by the transaction, since she
 had demanded fully a quarter more than the vodka was worth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The travellers then took their seats, and since Chichikov's britchka kept
 alongside the britchka wherein Nozdrev and his brother-in-law were seated,
 it was possible for all three men to converse together as they proceeded.
 Behind them came Nozdrev's smaller buggy, with its team of lean stage
 horses and Porphyri and the puppy. But inasmuch as the conversation which
 the travellers maintained was not of a kind likely to interest the reader,
 I might do worse than say something concerning Nozdrev himself, seeing
 that he is destined to play no small role in our story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nozdrev's face will be familiar to the reader, seeing that every one must
 have encountered many such. Fellows of the kind are known as "gay young
 sparks," and, even in their boyhood and school days, earn a reputation for
 being bons camarades (though with it all they come in for some hard
 knocks) for the reason that their faces evince an element of frankness,
 directness, and enterprise which enables them soon to make friends, and,
 almost before you have had time to look around, to start addressing you in
 the second person singular. Yet, while cementing such friendships for all
 eternity, almost always they begin quarrelling the same evening, since,
 throughout, they are a loquacious, dissipated, high-spirited, over-showy
 tribe. Indeed, at thirty-five Nozdrev was just what he had been an
 eighteen and twenty?he was just such a lover of fast living. Nor had
 his marriage in any way changed him, and the less so since his wife had
 soon departed to another world, and left behind her two children, whom he
 did not want, and who were therefore placed in the charge of a
 good-looking nursemaid. Never at any time could he remain at home for more
 than a single day, for his keen scent could range over scores and scores
 of versts, and detect any fair which promised balls and crowds.
 Consequently in a trice he would be there?quarrelling, and creating
 disturbances over the gaming-table (like all men of his type, he had a
 perfect passion for cards) yet playing neither a faultless nor an
 over-clean game, since he was both a blunderer and able to indulge in a
 large number of illicit cuts and other devices. The result was that the
 game often ended in another kind of sport altogether. That is to say,
 either he received a good kicking, or he had his thick and very handsome
 whiskers pulled; with the result that on certain occasions he returned
 home with one of those appendages looking decidedly ragged. Yet his plump,
 healthy-looking cheeks were so robustly constituted, and contained such an
 abundance of recreative vigour, that a new whisker soon sprouted in place
 of the old one, and even surpassed its predecessor. Again (and the
 following is a phenomenon peculiar to Russia) a very short time would have
 elapsed before once more he would be consorting with the very cronies who
 had recently cuffed him?and consorting with them as though nothing
 whatsoever had happened?no reference to the subject being made by
 him, and they too holding their tongues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In short, Nozdrev was, as it were, a man of incident. Never was he present
 at any gathering without some sort of a fracas occurring thereat. Either
 he would require to be expelled from the room by gendarmes, or his friends
 would have to kick him out into the street. At all events, should neither
 of those occurrences take place, at least he did something of a nature
 which would not otherwise have been witnessed. That is to say, should he
 not play the fool in a buffet to such an extent as to make very one smile,
 you may be sure that he was engaged in lying to a degree which at times
 abashed even himself. Moreover, the man lied without reason. For instance,
 he would begin telling a story to the effect that he possessed a
 blue-coated or a red-coated horse; until, in the end, his listeners would
 be forced to leave him with the remark, "You are giving us some fine
 stuff, old fellow!" Also, men like Nozdrev have a passion for insulting
 their neighbours without the least excuse afforded. (For that matter, even
 a man of good standing and of respectable exterior?a man with a star
 on his breast?may unexpectedly press your hand one day, and begin
 talking to you on subjects of a nature to give food for serious thought.
 Yet just as unexpectedly may that man start abusing you to your face?and
 do so in a manner worthy of a collegiate registrar rather than of a man
 who wears a star on his breast and aspires to converse on subjects which
 merit reflection. All that one can do in such a case is to stand shrugging
 one's shoulders in amazement.) Well, Nozdrev had just such a weakness. The
 more he became friendly with a man, the sooner would he insult him, and be
 ready to spread calumnies as to his reputation. Yet all the while he would
 consider himself the insulted one's friend, and, should he meet him again,
 would greet him in the most amicable style possible, and say, "You rascal,
 why have you given up coming to see me." Thus, taken all round, Nozdrev
 was a person of many aspects and numerous potentialities. In one and the
 same breath would he propose to go with you whithersoever you might choose
 (even to the very ends of the world should you so require) or to enter
 upon any sort of an enterprise with you, or to exchange any commodity for
 any other commodity which you might care to name. Guns, horses, dogs, all
 were subjects for barter?though not for profit so far as YOU were
 concerned. Such traits are mostly the outcome of a boisterous temperament,
 as is additionally exemplified by the fact that if at a fair he chanced to
 fall in with a simpleton and to fleece him, he would then proceed to buy a
 quantity of the very first articles which came to hand?horse-collars,
 cigar-lighters, dresses for his nursemaid, foals, raisins, silver ewers,
 lengths of holland, wheatmeal, tobacco, revolvers, dried herrings,
 pictures, whetstones, crockery, boots, and so forth, until every atom of
 his money was exhausted. Yet seldom were these articles conveyed home,
 since, as a rule, the same day saw them lost to some more skilful gambler,
 in addition to his pipe, his tobacco-pouch, his mouthpiece, his
 four-horsed turn-out, and his coachman: with the result that, stripped to
 his very shirt, he would be forced to beg the loan of a vehicle from a
 friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such was Nozdrev. Some may say that characters of his type have become
 extinct, that Nozdrevs no longer exist. Alas! such as say this will be
 wrong; for many a day must pass before the Nozdrevs will have disappeared
 from our ken. Everywhere they are to be seen in our midst?the only
 difference between the new and the old being a difference of garments.
 Persons of superficial observation are apt to consider that a man clad in
 a different coat is quite a different person from what he used to be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To continue. The three vehicles bowled up to the steps of Nozdrev's house,
 and their occupants alighted. But no preparations whatsoever had been made
 for the guest's reception, for on some wooden trestles in the centre of
 the dining-room a couple of peasants were engaged in whitewashing the
 ceiling and drawling out an endless song as they splashed their stuff
 about the floor. Hastily bidding peasants and trestles to be gone, Nozdrev
 departed to another room with further instructions. Indeed, so audible was
 the sound of his voice as he ordered dinner that Chichikov?who was
 beginning to feel hungry once more?was enabled to gather that it
 would be at least five o'clock before a meal of any kind would be
 available. On his return, Nozdrev invited his companions to inspect his
 establishment?even though as early as two o'clock he had to announce
 that nothing more was to be seen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The tour began with a view of the stables, where the party saw two mares
 (the one a grey, and the other a roan) and a colt; which latter animal,
 though far from showy, Nozdrev declared to have cost him ten thousand
 roubles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You NEVER paid ten thousand roubles for the brute!" exclaimed the
 brother-in-law. "He isn't worth even a thousand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By God, I DID pay ten thousand!" asserted Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can swear that as much as you like," retorted the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you bet that I did not?" asked Nozdrev, but the brother-in-law
 declined the offer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next, Nozdrev showed his guests some empty stalls where a number of
 equally fine animals (so he alleged) had lately stood. Also there was on
 view the goat which an old belief still considers to be an indispensable
 adjunct to such places, even though its apparent use is to pace up and
 down beneath the noses of the horses as though the place belonged to it.
 Thereafter the host took his guests to look at a young wolf which he had
 got tied to a chain. "He is fed on nothing but raw meat," he explained,
 "for I want him to grow up as fierce as possible." Then the party
 inspected a pond in which there were "fish of such a size that it would
 take two men all their time to lift one of them out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This piece of information was received with renewed incredulity on the
 part of the brother-in-law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Chichikov," went on Nozdrev, "let me show you a truly magnificent
 brace of dogs. The hardness of their muscles will surprise you, and they
 have jowls as sharp as needles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So saying, he led the way to a small, but neatly-built, shed surrounded on
 every side with a fenced-in run. Entering this run, the visitors beheld a
 number of dogs of all sorts and sizes and colours. In their midst Nozdrev
 looked like a father lording it over his family circle. Erecting their
 tails?their "stems," as dog fanciers call those members?the
 animals came bounding to greet the party, and fully a score of them laid
 their paws upon Chichikov's shoulders. Indeed, one dog was moved with such
 friendliness that, standing on its hind legs, it licked him on the lips,
 and so forced him to spit. That done, the visitors duly inspected the
 couple already mentioned, and expressed astonishment at their muscles.
 True enough, they were fine animals. Next, the party looked at a Crimean
 bitch which, though blind and fast nearing her end, had, two years ago,
 been a truly magnificent dog. At all events, so said Nozdrev. Next came
 another bitch?also blind; then an inspection of the water-mill,
 which lacked the spindle-socket wherein the upper stone ought to have been
 revolving?"fluttering," to use the Russian peasant's quaint
 expression. "But never mind," said Nozdrev. "Let us proceed to the
 blacksmith's shop." So to the blacksmith's shop the party proceeded, and
 when the said shop had been viewed, Nozdrev said as he pointed to a field:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In this field I have seen such numbers of hares as to render the ground
 quite invisible. Indeed, on one occasion I, with my own hands, caught a
 hare by the hind legs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You never caught a hare by the hind legs with your hands!" remarked the
 brother-in-law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I DID" reiterated Nozdrev. "However, let me show you the boundary
 where my lands come to an end."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So saying, he started to conduct his guests across a field which consisted
 mostly of moleheaps, and in which the party had to pick their way between
 strips of ploughed land and of harrowed. Soon Chichikov began to feel
 weary, for the terrain was so low-lying that in many spots water could be
 heard squelching underfoot, and though for a while the visitors watched
 their feet, and stepped carefully, they soon perceived that such a course
 availed them nothing, and took to following their noses, without either
 selecting or avoiding the spots where the mire happened to be deeper or
 the reverse. At length, when a considerable distance had been covered,
 they caught sight of a boundary-post and a narrow ditch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is the boundary," said Nozdrev. "Everything that you see on this
 side of the post is mine, as well as the forest on the other side of it,
 and what lies beyond the forest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "WHEN did that forest become yours?" asked the brother-in-law. "It cannot
 be long since you purchased it, for it never USED to be yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it isn't long since I purchased it," said Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long? Why, I purchased it three days ago, and gave a pretty sum for
 it, as the devil knows!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? Why, three days ago you were at the fair?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wiseacre! Cannot one be at a fair and buy land at the same time? Yes, I
 WAS at the fair, and my steward bought the land in my absence."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, your STEWARD bought it." The brother-in-law seemed doubtful, and
 shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The guests returned by the same route as that by which they had come;
 whereafter, on reaching the house, Nozdrev conducted them to his study,
 which contained not a trace of the things usually to be found in such
 apartments?such things as books and papers. On the contrary, the
 only articles to be seen were a sword and a brace of guns?the one
 "of them worth three hundred roubles," and the other "about eight
 hundred." The brother-in-law inspected the articles in question, and then
 shook his head as before. Next, the visitors were shown some "real
 Turkish" daggers, of which one bore the inadvertent inscription, "Saveli
 Sibiriakov <small>19</small>,
 Master Cutler." Then came a barrel-organ, on which Nozdrev started to play
 some tune or another. For a while the sounds were not wholly unpleasing,
 but suddenly something seemed to go wrong, for a mazurka started, to be
 followed by "Marlborough has gone to the war," and to this, again, there
 succeeded an antiquated waltz. Also, long after Nozdrev had ceased to turn
 the handle, one particularly shrill-pitched pipe which had, throughout,
 refused to harmonise with the rest kept up a protracted whistling on its
 own account. Then followed an exhibition of tobacco pipes?pipes of
 clay, of wood, of meerschaum, pipes smoked and non-smoked; pipes wrapped
 in chamois leather and not so wrapped; an amber-mounted hookah (a stake
 won at cards) and a tobacco pouch (worked, it was alleged, by some
 countess who had fallen in love with Nozdrev at a posthouse, and whose
 handiwork Nozdrev averred to constitute the "sublimity of superfluity"?a
 term which, in the Nozdrevian vocabulary, purported to signify the acme of
 perfection).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, after some hors-d'oeuvres of sturgeon's back, they sat down to
 table?the time being then nearly five o'clock. But the meal did not
 constitute by any means the best of which Chichikov had ever partaken,
 seeing that some of the dishes were overcooked, and others were scarcely
 cooked at all. Evidently their compounder had trusted chiefly to
 inspiration?she had laid hold of the first thing which had happened
 to come to hand. For instance, had pepper represented the nearest article
 within reach, she had added pepper wholesale. Had a cabbage chanced to be
 so encountered, she had pressed it also into the service. And the same
 with milk, bacon, and peas. In short, her rule seemed to have been "Make a
 hot dish of some sort, and some sort of taste will result." For the rest,
 Nozdrev drew heavily upon the wine. Even before the soup had been served,
 he had poured out for each guest a bumper of port and another of "haut"
 sauterne. (Never in provincial towns is ordinary, vulgar sauterne even
 procurable.) Next, he called for a bottle of madeira?"as fine a
 tipple as ever a field-marshall drank"; but the madeira only burnt the
 mouth, since the dealers, familiar with the taste of our landed gentry
 (who love "good" madeira) invariably doctor the stuff with copious dashes
 of rum and Imperial vodka, in the hope that Russian stomachs will thus be
 enabled to carry off the lot. After this bottle Nozdrev called for another
 and "a very special" brand?a brand which he declared to consist of a
 blend of burgundy and champagne, and of which he poured generous measures
 into the glasses of Chichikov and the brother-in-law as they sat to right
 and left of him. But since Chichikov noticed that, after doing so, he
 added only a scanty modicum of the mixture to his own tumbler, our hero
 determined to be cautious, and therefore took advantage of a moment when
 Nozdrev had again plunged into conversation and was yet a third time
 engaged in refilling his brother-in-law's glass, to contrive to upset his
 (Chichikov's) glass over his plate. In time there came also to table a
 tart of mountain-ashberries?berries which the host declared to
 equal, in taste, ripe plums, but which, curiously enough, smacked more of
 corn brandy. Next, the company consumed a sort of pasty of which the
 precise name has escaped me, but which the host rendered differently even
 on the second occasion of its being mentioned. The meal over, and the
 whole tale of wines tried, the guests still retained their seats?a
 circumstance which embarrassed Chichikov, seeing that he had no mind to
 propound his pet scheme in the presence of Nozdrev's brother-in-law, who
 was a complete stranger to him. No, that subject called for amicable and
 PRIVATE conversation. Nevertheless, the brother-in-law appeared to bode
 little danger, seeing that he had taken on board a full cargo, and was now
 engaged in doing nothing of a more menacing nature than picking his nose.
 At length he himself noticed that he was not altogether in a responsible
 condition; wherefore he rose and began to make excuses for departing
 homewards, though in a tone so drowsy and lethargic that, to quote the
 Russian proverb, he might almost have been "pulling a collar on to a horse
 by the clasps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no!" cried Nozdrev. "I am NOT going to let you go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I MUST go," replied the brother-in-law. "Don't dry to hinder me. You
 are annoying me greatly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rubbish! We are going to play a game of banker."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no. You must play it without me, my friend. My wife is expecting me
 at home, and I must go and tell her all about the fair. Yes, I MUST go if
 I am to please her. Do not try to detain me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your wife be?! But have you REALLY an important piece of business
 with her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, my friend. The real reason is that she is a good and trustful
 woman, and that she does a great deal for me. The tears spring to my eyes
 as I think of it. Do not detain me. As an honourable man I say that I must
 go. Of that I do assure you in all sincerity."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, let him go," put in Chichikov under his breath. "What use will he be
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," said Nozdrev, "though, damn it, I do not like fellows who
 lose their heads." Then he added to his brother-in-law: "All right, Thetuk
 <small>20</small>.
 Off you go to your wife and your woman's talk and may the devil go with
 you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not insult me with the term Thetuk," retorted the brother-in-law. "To
 her I owe my life, and she is a dear, good woman, and has shown me much
 affection. At the very thought of it I could weep. You see, she will be
 asking me what I have seen at the fair, and tell her about it I must, for
 she is such a dear, good woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then off you go to her with your pack of lies. Here is your cap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, good friend, you are not to speak of her like that. By so doing you
 offend me greatly?I say that she is a dear, good woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then run along home to her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am just going. Excuse me for having been unable to stay. Gladly
 would I have stayed, but really I cannot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The brother-in-law repeated his excuses again and again without noticing
 that he had entered the britchka, that it had passed through the gates,
 and that he was now in the open country. Permissibly we may suppose that
 his wife succeeded in gleaning from him few details of the fair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a fool!" said Nozdrev as, standing by the window, he watched the
 departing vehicle. "Yet his off-horse is not such a bad one. For a long
 time past I have been wanting to get hold of it. A man like that is simply
 impossible. Yes, he is a Thetuk, a regular Thetuk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that they repaired to the parlour, where, on Porphyri bringing
 candles, Chichikov perceived that his host had produced a pack of cards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you what," said Nozdrev, pressing the sides of the pack together,
 and then slightly bending them, so that the pack cracked and a card flew
 out. "How would it be if, to pass the time, I were to make a bank of three
 hundred?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov pretended not to have heard him, but remarked with an air of
 having just recollected a forgotten point:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By the way, I had omitted to say that I have a request to make of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What request?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First give me your word that you will grant it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the request, I say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you give me your word, do you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your word of honour?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word of honour."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This, then, is my request. I presume that you have a large number of dead
 serfs whose names have not yet been removed from the revision list?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have. But why do you ask?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I want you to make them over to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of what use would they be to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind. I have a purpose in wanting them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What purpose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A purpose which is strictly my own affair. In short, I need them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem to have hatched a very fine scheme. Out with it, now! What is in
 the wind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How could I have hatched such a scheme as you say? One could not very
 well hatch a scheme out of such a trifle as this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then for what purpose do you want the serfs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, the curiosity of the man! He wants to poke his fingers into and smell
 over every detail!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do you decline to say what is in your mind? At all events, until you
 DO say I shall not move in the matter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how would it benefit you to know what my plans are? A whim has seized
 me. That is all. Nor are you playing fair. You have given me your word of
 honour, yet now you are trying to back out of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No matter what you desire me to do, I decline to do it until you have
 told me your purpose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What am I to say to the fellow?" thought Chichikov. He reflected for a
 moment, and then explained that he wanted the dead souls in order to
 acquire a better standing in society, since at present he possessed little
 landed property, and only a handful of serfs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are lying," said Nozdrev without even letting him finish. "Yes, you
 are lying my good friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov himself perceived that his device had been a clumsy one, and his
 pretext weak. "I must tell him straight out," he said to himself as he
 pulled his wits together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Should I tell you the truth," he added aloud, "I must beg of you not to
 repeat it. The truth is that I am thinking of getting married. But,
 unfortunately, my betrothed's father and mother are very ambitious people,
 and do not want me to marry her, since they desire the bridegroom to own
 not less than three hundred souls, whereas I own but a hundred and fifty,
 and that number is not sufficient."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Again you are lying," said Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then look here; I have been lying only to this extent." And Chichikov
 marked off upon his little finger a minute portion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless I will bet my head that you have been lying throughout."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come! That is not very civil of you. Why should I have been lying?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I know you, and know that you are a regular skinflint. I say that
 in all friendship. If I possessed any power over you I should hang you to
 the nearest tree."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This remark hurt Chichikov, for at any time he disliked expressions gross
 or offensive to decency, and never allowed any one?no, not even
 persons of the highest rank?to behave towards him with an undue
 measure of familiarity. Consequently his sense of umbrage on the present
 occasion was unbounded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By God, I WOULD hang you!" repeated Nozdrev. "I say this frankly, and not
 for the purpose of offending you, but simply to communicate to you my
 friendly opinion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To everything there are limits," retorted Chichikov stiffly. "If you want
 to indulge in speeches of that sort you had better return to the
 barracks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, after a pause he added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you do not care to give me the serfs, why not SELL them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "SELL them? <i>I</i> know you, you rascal! You wouldn't give me very much
 for them, WOULD you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A nice fellow! Look here. What are they to you? So many diamonds, eh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought so! <i>I</i> know you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, but I could wish that you were a member of the Jewish
 persuasion. You would give them to me fast enough then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On the contrary, to show you that I am not a usurer, I will decline to
 ask of you a single kopeck for the serfs. All that you need do is to buy
 that colt of mine, and then I will throw in the serfs in addition."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what should <i>I</i> want with your colt?" said Chichikov, genuinely
 astonished at the proposal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What should YOU want with him? Why, I have bought him for ten thousand
 roubles, and am ready to let you have him for four."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I ask you again: of what use could the colt possibly be to me? I am not
 the keeper of a breeding establishment."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! I see that you fail to understand me. Let me suggest that you pay
 down at once three thousand roubles of the purchase money, and leave the
 other thousand until later."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I do not mean to buy the colt, damn him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then buy the roan mare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, nor the roan mare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you shall have both the mare and the grey horse which you have seen
 in my stables for two thousand roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I require no horses at all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you would be able to sell them again. You would be able to get thrice
 their purchase price at the very first fair that was held."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then sell them at that fair yourself, seeing that you are so certain of
 making a triple profit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I should make it fast enough, only I want YOU to benefit by the
 transaction."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov duly thanked his interlocutor, but continued to decline either
 the grey horse or the roan mare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then buy a few dogs," said Nozdrev. "I can sell you a couple of hides
 a-quiver, ears well pricked, coats like quills, ribs barrel-shaped, and
 paws so tucked up as scarcely to graze the ground when they run."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of what use would those dogs be to me? I am not a sportsman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I WANT you to have the dogs. Listen. If you won't have the dogs, then
 buy my barrel-organ. 'Tis a splendid instrument. As a man of honour I can
 tell you that, when new, it cost me fifteen hundred roubles. Well, you
 shall have it for nine hundred."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come! What should I want with a barrel-organ? I am not a German, to
 go hauling it about the roads and begging for coppers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But this is quite a different kind of organ from the one which Germans
 take about with them. You see, it is a REAL organ. Look at it for
 yourself. It is made of the best wood. I will take you to have another
 view of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And seizing Chichikov by the hand, Nozdrev drew him towards the other
 room, where, in spite of the fact that Chichikov, with his feet planted
 firmly on the floor, assured his host, again and again, that he knew
 exactly what the organ was like, he was forced once more to hear how
 Marlborough went to the war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, since you don't care to give me any money for it," persisted
 Nozdrev, "listen to the following proposal. I will give you the
 barrel-organ and all the dead souls which I possess, and in return you
 shall give me your britchka, and another three hundred roubles into the
 bargain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Listen to the man! In that case, what should I have left to drive in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I would stand you another britchka. Come to the coach-house, and I
 will show you the one I mean. It only needs repainting to look a perfectly
 splendid britchka."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The ramping, incorrigible devil!" thought Chichikov to himself as at all
 hazards he resolved to escape from britchkas, organs, and every species of
 dog, however marvellously barrel-ribbed and tucked up of paw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And in exchange, you shall have the britchka, the barrel-organ, and the
 dead souls," repeated Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I must decline the offer," said Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I don't WANT the things?I am full up already."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can see that you don't know how things should be done between good
 friends and comrades. Plainly you are a man of two faces."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean, you fool? Think for yourself. Why should I acquire
 articles which I don't want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say no more about it, if you please. I have quite taken your measure. But
 see here. Should you care to play a game of banker? I am ready to stake
 both the dead souls and the barrel-organ at cards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; to leave an issue to cards means to submit oneself to the unknown,"
 said Chichikov, covertly glancing at the pack which Nozdrev had got in his
 hands. Somehow the way in which his companion had cut that pack seemed to
 him suspicious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why 'to the unknown'?" asked Nozdrev. "There is no such thing as 'the
 unknown.' Should luck be on your side, you may win the devil knows what a
 haul. Oh, luck, luck!" he went on, beginning to deal, in the hope of
 raising a quarrel. "Here is the cursed nine upon which, the other night, I
 lost everything. All along I knew that I should lose my money. Said I to
 myself: 'The devil take you, you false, accursed card!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just as Nozdrev uttered the words Porphyri entered with a fresh bottle of
 liquor; but Chichikov declined either to play or to drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do you refuse to play?" asked Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I feel indisposed to do so. Moreover, I must confess that I am no
 great hand at cards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "WHY are you no great hand at them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov shrugged his shoulders. "Because I am not," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are no great hand at ANYTHING, I think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does that matter? God has made me so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The truth is that you are a Thetuk, and nothing else. Once upon a time I
 believed you to be a good fellow, but now I see that you don't understand
 civility. One cannot speak to you as one would to an intimate, for there
 is no frankness or sincerity about you. You are a regular Sobakevitch?just
 such another as he."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For what reason are you abusing me? Am I in any way at fault for
 declining to play cards? Sell me those souls if you are the man to
 hesitate over such rubbish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The foul fiend take you! I was about to have given them to you for
 nothing, but now you shan't have them at all?not if you offer me
 three kingdoms in exchange. Henceforth I will have nothing to do with you,
 you cobbler, you dirty blacksmith! Porphyri, go and tell the ostler to
 give the gentleman's horses no oats, but only hay."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This development Chichikov had hardly expected.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you," added Nozdrev to his guest, "get out of my sight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet in spite of this, host and guest took supper together?even
 though on this occasion the table was adorned with no wines of fictitious
 nomenclature, but only with a bottle which reared its solitary head beside
 a jug of what is usually known as vin ordinaire. When supper was over
 Nozdrev said to Chichikov as he conducted him to a side room where a bed
 had been made up:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is where you are to sleep. I cannot very well wish you good-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Left to himself on Nozdrev's departure, Chichikov felt in a most
 unenviable frame of mind. Full of inward vexation, he blamed himself
 bitterly for having come to see this man and so wasted valuable time; but
 even more did he blame himself for having told him of his scheme?for
 having acted as carelessly as a child or a madman. Of a surety the scheme
 was not one which ought to have been confided to a man like Nozdrev, for
 he was a worthless fellow who might lie about it, and append additions to
 it, and spread such stories as would give rise to God knows what scandals.
 "This is indeed bad!" Chichikov said to himself. "I have been an absolute
 fool." Consequently he spent an uneasy night?this uneasiness being
 increased by the fact that a number of small, but vigorous, insects so
 feasted upon him that he could do nothing but scratch the spots and
 exclaim, "The devil take you and Nozdrev alike!" Only when morning was
 approaching did he fall asleep. On rising, he made it his first business
 (after donning dressing-gown and slippers) to cross the courtyard to the
 stable, for the purpose of ordering Selifan to harness the britchka. Just
 as he was returning from his errand he encountered Nozdrev, clad in a
 dressing-gown, and holding a pipe between his teeth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Host and guest greeted one another in friendly fashion, and Nozdrev
 inquired how Chichikov had slept.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fairly well," replied Chichikov, but with a touch of dryness in his tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The same with myself," said Nozdrev. "The truth is that such a lot of
 nasty brutes kept crawling over me that even to speak of it gives me the
 shudders. Likewise, as the effect of last night's doings, a whole squadron
 of soldiers seemed to be camping on my chest, and giving me a flogging.
 Ugh! And whom also do you think I saw in a dream? You would never guess.
 Why, it was Staff-Captain Potsieluev and Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," though Chichikov to himself, "and I wish that they too would give
 you a public thrashing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I felt so ill!" went on Nozdrev. "And just after I had fallen asleep
 something DID come and sting me. Probably it was a party of hag fleas.
 Now, dress yourself, and I will be with you presently. First of all I must
 give that scoundrel of a bailiff a wigging."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov departed to his own room to wash and dress; which process
 completed, he entered the dining-room to find the table laid with
 tea-things and a bottle of rum. Clearly no broom had yet touched the
 place, for there remained traces of the previous night's dinner and supper
 in the shape of crumbs thrown over the floor and tobacco ash on the
 tablecloth. The host himself, when he entered, was still clad in a
 dressing-gown exposing a hairy chest; and as he sat holding his pipe in
 his hand, and drinking tea from a cup, he would have made a model for the
 sort of painter who prefers to portray gentlemen of the less curled and
 scented order.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What think you?" he asked of Chichikov after a short silence. "Are you
 willing NOW to play me for those souls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have told you that I never play cards. If the souls are for sale, I
 will buy them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I decline to sell them. Such would not be the course proper between
 friends. But a game of banker would be quite another matter. Let us deal
 the cards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have told you that I decline to play."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you will not agree to an exchange?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then look here. Suppose we play a game of chess. If you win, the souls
 shall be yours. There are lot which I should like to see crossed off the
 revision list. Hi, Porphyri! Bring me the chessboard."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are wasting your time. I will play neither chess nor cards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But chess is different from playing with a bank. In chess there can be
 neither luck nor cheating, for everything depends upon skill. In fact, I
 warn you that I cannot possibly play with you unless you allow me a move
 or two in advance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The same with me," thought Chichikov. "Shall I, or shall I not, play this
 fellow? I used not to be a bad chess-player, and it is a sport in which he
 would find it more difficult to be up to his tricks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," he added aloud. "I WILL play you at chess."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And stake the souls for a hundred roubles?" asked Nozdrev.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Why for a hundred? Would it not be sufficient to stake them for
 fifty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. What would be the use of fifty? Nevertheless, for the hundred roubles
 I will throw in a moderately old puppy, or else a gold seal and
 watch-chain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," assented Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then how many moves are you going to allow me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is THAT to be part of the bargain? Why, none, of course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At least allow me two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, none. I myself am only a poor player."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>I</i> know you and your poor play," said Nozdrev, moving a chessman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In fact, it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand,"
 replied Chichikov, also moving a piece.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! <i>I</i> know you and your poor play," repeated Nozdrev, moving a
 second chessman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say again that it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my
 hand." And Chichikov, in his turn, moved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! <i>I</i> know you and your poor play," repeated Nozdrev, for the
 third time as he made a third move. At the same moment the cuff of one of
 his sleeves happened to dislodge another chessman from its position.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Again, I say," said Chichikov, "that 'tis a long time since last?But
 hi! look here! Put that piece back in its place!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What piece?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This one." And almost as Chichikov spoke he saw a third chessman coming
 into view between the queens. God only knows whence that chessman had
 materialised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no!" shouted Chichikov as he rose from the table. "It is impossible
 to play with a man like you. People don't move three pieces at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How 'three pieces'? All that I have done is to make a mistake?to
 move one of my pieces by accident. If you like, I will forfeit it to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And whence has the third piece come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What third piece?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The one now standing between the queens?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Tis one of your own pieces. Surely you are forgetting?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, my friend. I have counted every move, and can remember each one.
 That piece has only just become added to the board. Put it back in its
 place, I say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Its place? Which IS its place?" But Nozdrev had reddened a good deal. "I
 perceive you to be a strategist at the game."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, good friend. YOU are the strategist?though an unsuccessful
 one, as it happens."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then of what are you supposing me capable? Of cheating you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not supposing you capable of anything. All that I say is that I will
 not play with you any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you can't refuse to," said Nozdrev, growing heated. "You see, the
 game has begun."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless, I have a right not to continue it, seeing that you are not
 playing as an honest man should do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are lying?you cannot truthfully say that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Tis you who are lying."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I have NOT cheated. Consequently you cannot refuse to play, but must
 continue the game to a finish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You cannot force me to play," retorted Chichikov coldly as, turning to
 the chessboard, he swept the pieces into confusion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nozdrev approached Chichikov with a manner so threatening that the other
 fell back a couple of paces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I WILL force you to play," said Nozdrev. "It is no use you making a mess
 of the chessboard, for I can remember every move. We will replace the
 chessmen exactly as they were."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, my friend. The game is over, and I play you no more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You say that you will not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Surely you can see for yourself that such a thing is impossible?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That cock won't fight. Say at once that you refuse to play with me." And
 Nozdrev approached a step nearer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well; I DO say that," replied Chichikov, and at the same moment
 raised his hands towards his face, for the dispute was growing heated. Nor
 was the act of caution altogether unwarranted, for Nozdrev also raised his
 fist, and it may be that one of her hero's plump, pleasant-looking cheeks
 would have sustained an indelible insult had not he (Chichikov) parried
 the blow and, seizing Nozdrev by his whirling arms, held them fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Porphyri! Pavlushka!" shouted Nozdrev as madly he strove to free himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On hearing the words, Chichikov, both because he wished to avoid rendering
 the servants witnesses of the unedifying scene and because he felt that it
 would be of no avail to hold Nozdrev any longer, let go of the latter's
 arms; but at the same moment Porphyri and Pavlushka entered the room?a
 pair of stout rascals with whom it would be unwise to meddle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you, or do you not, intend to finish the game?" said Nozdrev. "Give me
 a direct answer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; it will not be possible to finish the game," replied Chichikov,
 glancing out of the window. He could see his britchka standing ready for
 him, and Selifan evidently awaiting orders to draw up to the entrance
 steps. But from the room there was no escape, since in the doorway was
 posted the couple of well-built serving-men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it is as I say? You refuse to finish the game?" repeated Nozdrev,
 his face as red as fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would have finished it had you played like a man of honour. But, as it
 is, I cannot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You cannot, eh, you villain? You find that you cannot as soon as you find
 that you are not winning? Thrash him, you fellows!" And as he spoke
 Nozdrev grasped the cherrywood shank of his pipe. Chichikov turned as
 white as a sheet. He tried to say something, but his quivering lips
 emitted no sound. "Thrash him!" again shouted Nozdrev as he rushed forward
 in a state of heat and perspiration more proper to a warrior who is
 attacking an impregnable fortress. "Thrash him!" again he shouted in a
 voice like that of some half-demented lieutenant whose desperate bravery
 has acquired such a reputation that orders have had to be issued that his
 hands shall be held lest he attempt deeds of over-presumptuous daring.
 Seized with the military spirit, however, the lieutenant's head begins to
 whirl, and before his eye there flits the image of Suvorov <small>21</small>.
 He advances to the great encounter, and impulsively cries, "Forward, my
 sons!"?cries it without reflecting that he may be spoiling the plan
 of the general attack, that millions of rifles may be protruding their
 muzzles through the embrasures of the impregnable, towering walls of the
 fortress, that his own impotent assault may be destined to be dissipated
 like dust before the wind, and that already there may have been launched
 on its whistling career the bullet which is to close for ever his
 vociferous throat. However, if Nozdrev resembled the headstrong, desperate
 lieutenant whom we have just pictured as advancing upon a fortress, at
 least the fortress itself in no way resembled the impregnable stronghold
 which I have described. As a matter of fact, the fortress became seized
 with a panic which drove its spirit into its boots. First of all, the
 chair with which Chichikov (the fortress in question) sought to defend
 himself was wrested from his grasp by the serfs, and then?blinking
 and neither alive nor dead?he turned to parry the Circassian
 pipe-stem of his host. In fact, God only knows what would have happened
 had not the fates been pleased by a miracle to deliver Chichikov's elegant
 back and shoulders from the onslaught. Suddenly, and as unexpectedly as
 though the sound had come from the clouds, there made itself heard the
 tinkling notes of a collar-bell, and then the rumble of wheels approaching
 the entrance steps, and, lastly, the snorting and hard breathing of a team
 of horses as a vehicle came to a standstill. Involuntarily all present
 glanced through the window, and saw a man clad in a semi-military
 greatcoat leap from a buggy. After making an inquiry or two in the hall,
 he entered the dining-room just at the juncture when Chichikov, almost
 swooning with terror, had found himself placed in about as awkward a
 situation as could well befall a mortal man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kindly tell me which of you is Monsieur Nozdrev?" said the unknown with a
 glance of perplexity both at the person named (who was still standing with
 pipe-shank upraised) and at Chichikov (who was just beginning to recover
 from his unpleasant predicament).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kindly tell ME whom I have the honour of addressing?" retorted Nozdrev as
 he approached the official.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am the Superintendent of Rural Police."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what do you want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have come to fulfil a commission imposed upon me. That is to say, I
 have come to place you under arrest until your case shall have been
 decided."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rubbish! What case, pray?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The case in which you involved yourself when, in a drunken condition, and
 through the instrumentality of a walking-stick, you offered grave offence
 to the person of Landowner Maksimov."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You lie! To your face I tell you that never in my life have I set eyes
 upon Landowner Maksimov."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good sir, allow me to represent to you that I am a Government officer.
 Speeches like that you may address to your servants, but not to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this point Chichikov, without waiting for Nozdrev's reply, seized his
 cap, slipped behind the Superintendent's back, rushed out on to the
 verandah, sprang into his britchka, and ordered Selifan to drive like the
 wind.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V
 </h2>
 <p>
 Certainly Chichikov was a thorough coward, for, although the britchka
 pursued its headlong course until Nozdrev's establishment had disappeared
 behind hillocks and hedgerows, our hero continued to glance nervously
 behind him, as though every moment expecting to see a stern chase begin.
 His breath came with difficulty, and when he tried his heart with his
 hands he could feel it fluttering like a quail caught in a net.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a sweat the fellow has thrown me into!" he thought to himself, while
 many a dire and forceful aspiration passed through his mind. Indeed, the
 expressions to which he gave vent were most inelegant in their nature. But
 what was to be done next? He was a Russian and thoroughly aroused. The
 affair had been no joke. "But for the Superintendent," he reflected, "I
 might never again have looked upon God's daylight?I might have
 vanished like a bubble on a pool, and left neither trace nor posterity nor
 property nor an honourable name for my future offspring to inherit!" (it
 seemed that our hero was particularly anxious with regard to his possible
 issue).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a scurvy barin!" mused Selifan as he drove along. "Never have I seen
 such a barin. I should like to spit in his face. 'Tis better to allow a
 man nothing to eat than to refuse to feed a horse properly. A horse needs
 his oats?they are his proper fare. Even if you make a man procure a
 meal at his own expense, don't deny a horse his oats, for he ought always
 to have them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An equally poor opinion of Nozdrev seemed to be cherished also by the
 steeds, for not only were the bay and the Assessor clearly out of spirits,
 but even the skewbald was wearing a dejected air. True, at home the
 skewbald got none but the poorer sorts of oats to eat, and Selifan never
 filled his trough without having first called him a villain; but at least
 they WERE oats, and not hay?they were stuff which could be chewed
 with a certain amount of relish. Also, there was the fact that at
 intervals he could intrude his long nose into his companions' troughs
 (especially when Selifan happened to be absent from the stable) and
 ascertain what THEIR provender was like. But at Nozdrev's there had been
 nothing but hay! That was not right. All three horses felt greatly
 discontented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But presently the malcontents had their reflections cut short in a very
 rude and unexpected manner. That is to say, they were brought back to
 practicalities by coming into violent collision with a six-horsed vehicle,
 while upon their heads descended both a babel of cries from the ladies
 inside and a storm of curses and abuse from the coachman. "Ah, you damned
 fool!" he vociferated. "I shouted to you loud enough! Draw out, you old
 raven, and keep to the right! Are you drunk?" Selifan himself felt
 conscious that he had been careless, but since a Russian does not care to
 admit a fault in the presence of strangers, he retorted with dignity: "Why
 have you run into US? Did you leave your eyes behind you at the last
 tavern that you stopped at?" With that he started to back the britchka, in
 the hope that it might get clear of the other's harness; but this would
 not do, for the pair were too hopelessly intertwined. Meanwhile the
 skewbald snuffed curiously at his new acquaintances as they stood planted
 on either side of him; while the ladies in the vehicle regarded the scene
 with an expression of terror. One of them was an old woman, and the other
 a damsel of about sixteen. A mass of golden hair fell daintily from a
 small head, and the oval of her comely face was as shapely as an egg, and
 white with the transparent whiteness seen when the hands of a housewife
 hold a new-laid egg to the light to let the sun's rays filter through its
 shell. The same tint marked the maiden's ears where they glowed in the
 sunshine, and, in short, what with the tears in her wide-open, arresting
 eyes, she presented so attractive a picture that our hero bestowed upon it
 more than a passing glance before he turned his attention to the hubbub
 which was being raised among the horses and the coachmen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Back out, you rook of Nizhni Novgorod!" the strangers' coachman shouted.
 Selifan tightened his reins, and the other driver did the same. The horses
 stepped back a little, and then came together again?this time
 getting a leg or two over the traces. In fact, so pleased did the skewbald
 seem with his new friends that he refused to stir from the melee into
 which an unforeseen chance had plunged him. Laying his muzzle lovingly
 upon the neck of one of his recently-acquired acquaintances, he seemed to
 be whispering something in that acquaintance's ear?and whispering
 pretty nonsense, too, to judge from the way in which that confidant kept
 shaking his ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length peasants from a village which happened to be near the scene of
 the accident tackled the mess; and since a spectacle of that kind is to
 the Russian muzhik what a newspaper or a club-meeting is to the German,
 the vehicles soon became the centre of a crowd, and the village denuded
 even of its old women and children. The traces were disentangled, and a
 few slaps on the nose forced the skewbald to draw back a little; after
 which the teams were straightened out and separated. Nevertheless, either
 sheer obstinacy or vexation at being parted from their new friends caused
 the strange team absolutely to refuse to move a leg. Their driver laid the
 whip about them, but still they stood as though rooted to the spot. At
 length the participatory efforts of the peasants rose to an unprecedented
 degree of enthusiasm, and they shouted in an intermittent chorus the
 advice, "Do you, Andrusha, take the head of the trace horse on the right,
 while Uncle Mitai mounts the shaft horse. Get up, Uncle Mitai." Upon that
 the lean, long, and red-bearded Uncle Mitai mounted the shaft horse; in
 which position he looked like a village steeple or the winder which is
 used to raise water from wells. The coachman whipped up his steeds afresh,
 but nothing came of it, and Uncle Mitai had proved useless. "Hold on, hold
 on!" shouted the peasants again. "Do you, Uncle Mitai, mount the trace
 horse, while Uncle Minai mounts the shaft horse." Whereupon Uncle Minai?a
 peasant with a pair of broad shoulders, a beard as black as charcoal, and
 a belly like the huge samovar in which sbiten is brewed for all attending
 a local market?hastened to seat himself upon the shaft horse, which
 almost sank to the ground beneath his weight. "NOW they will go all
 right!" the muzhiks exclaimed. "Lay it on hot, lay it on hot! Give that
 sorrel horse the whip, and make him squirm like a koramora <small>22</small>."
 Nevertheless, the affair in no way progressed; wherefore, seeing that
 flogging was of no use, Uncles Mitai and Minai BOTH mounted the sorrel,
 while Andrusha seated himself upon the trace horse. Then the coachman
 himself lost patience, and sent the two Uncles about their business?and
 not before it was time, seeing that the horses were steaming in a way that
 made it clear that, unless they were first winded, they would never reach
 the next posthouse. So they were given a moment's rest. That done, they
 moved off of their own accord!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Throughout, Chichikov had been gazing at the young unknown with great
 attention, and had even made one or two attempts to enter into
 conversation with her: but without success. Indeed, when the ladies
 departed, it was as in a dream that he saw the girl's comely presence, the
 delicate features of her face, and the slender outline of her form vanish
 from his sight; it was as in a dream that once more he saw only the road,
 the britchka, the three horses, Selifan, and the bare, empty fields.
 Everywhere in life?yes, even in the plainest, the dingiest ranks of
 society, as much as in those which are uniformly bright and presentable?a
 man may happen upon some phenomenon which is so entirely different from
 those which have hitherto fallen to his lot. Everywhere through the web of
 sorrow of which our lives are woven there may suddenly break a clear,
 radiant thread of joy; even as suddenly along the street of some poor,
 poverty-stricken village which, ordinarily, sees nought but a farm waggon
 there may came bowling a gorgeous coach with plated harness, picturesque
 horses, and a glitter of glass, so that the peasants stand gaping, and do
 not resume their caps until long after the strange equipage has become
 lost to sight. Thus the golden-haired maiden makes a sudden, unexpected
 appearance in our story, and as suddenly, as unexpectedly, disappears.
 Indeed, had it not been that the person concerned was Chichikov, and not
 some youth of twenty summers?a hussar or a student or, in general, a
 man standing on the threshold of life?what thoughts would not have
 sprung to birth, and stirred and spoken, within him; for what a length of
 time would he not have stood entranced as he stared into the distance and
 forgot alike his journey, the business still to be done, the possibility
 of incurring loss through lingering?himself, his vocation, the
 world, and everything else that the world contains!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But in the present case the hero was a man of middle-age, and of cautious
 and frigid temperament. True, he pondered over the incident, but in more
 deliberate fashion than a younger man would have done. That is to say, his
 reflections were not so irresponsible and unsteady. "She was a comely
 damsel," he said to himself as he opened his snuff-box and took a pinch.
 "But the important point is: Is she also a NICE DAMSEL? One thing she has
 in her favour?and that is that she appears only just to have left
 school, and not to have had time to become womanly in the worser sense. At
 present, therefore, she is like a child. Everything in her is simple, and
 she says just what she thinks, and laughs merely when she feels inclined.
 Such a damsel might be made into anything?or she might be turned
 into worthless rubbish. The latter, I surmise, for trudging after her she
 will have a fond mother and a bevy of aunts, and so forth?persons
 who, within a year, will have filled her with womanishness to the point
 where her own father wouldn't know her. And to that there will be added
 pride and affectation, and she will begin to observe established rules,
 and to rack her brains as to how, and how much, she ought to talk, and to
 whom, and where, and so forth. Every moment will see her growing timorous
 and confused lest she be saying too much. Finally, she will develop into a
 confirmed prevaricator, and end by marrying the devil knows whom!"
 Chichikov paused awhile. Then he went on: "Yet I should like to know who
 she is, and who her father is, and whether he is a rich landowner of good
 standing, or merely a respectable man who has acquired a fortune in the
 service of the Government. Should he allow her, on marriage, a dowry of,
 say, two hundred thousand roubles, she will be a very nice catch indeed.
 She might even, so to speak, make a man of good breeding happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Indeed, so attractively did the idea of the two hundred thousand roubles
 begin to dance before his imagination that he felt a twinge of
 self-reproach because, during the hubbub, he had not inquired of the
 postillion or the coachman who the travellers might be. But soon the sight
 of Sobakevitch's country house dissipated his thoughts, and forced him to
 return to his stock subject of reflection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sobakevitch's country house and estate were of very fair size, and on each
 side of the mansion were expanses of birch and pine forest in two shades
 of green. The wooden edifice itself had dark-grey walls and a red-gabled
 roof, for it was a mansion of the kind which Russia builds for her
 military settlers and for German colonists. A noticeable circumstance was
 the fact that the taste of the architect had differed from that of the
 proprietor?the former having manifestly been a pedant and desirous
 of symmetry, and the latter having wished only for comfort. Consequently
 he (the proprietor) had dispensed with all windows on one side of the
 mansion, and had caused to be inserted, in their place, only a small
 aperture which, doubtless, was intended to light an otherwise dark
 lumber-room. Likewise, the architect's best efforts had failed to cause
 the pediment to stand in the centre of the building, since the proprietor
 had had one of its four original columns removed. Evidently durability had
 been considered throughout, for the courtyard was enclosed by a strong and
 very high wooden fence, and both the stables, the coach-house, and the
 culinary premises were partially constructed of beams warranted to last
 for centuries. Nay, even the wooden huts of the peasantry were wonderful
 in the solidity of their construction, and not a clay wall or a carved
 pattern or other device was to be seen. Everything fitted exactly into its
 right place, and even the draw-well of the mansion was fashioned of the
 oakwood usually thought suitable only for mills or ships. In short,
 wherever Chichikov's eye turned he saw nothing that was not free from
 shoddy make and well and skilfully arranged. As he approached the entrance
 steps he caught sight of two faces peering from a window. One of them was
 that of a woman in a mobcap with features as long and as narrow as a
 cucumber, and the other that of a man with features as broad and as short
 as the Moldavian pumpkins (known as gorlianki) whereof balallaiki?the
 species of light, two-stringed instrument which constitutes the pride and
 the joy of the gay young fellow of twenty as he sits winking and smiling
 at the white-necked, white-bosomed maidens who have gathered to listen to
 his low-pitched tinkling?are fashioned. This scrutiny made, both
 faces withdrew, and there came out on to the entrance steps a lacquey clad
 in a grey jacket and a stiff blue collar. This functionary conducted
 Chichikov into the hall, where he was met by the master of the house
 himself, who requested his guest to enter, and then led him into the inner
 part of the mansion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A covert glance at Sobakevitch showed our hero that his host exactly
 resembled a moderate-sized bear. To complete the resemblance,
 Sobakevitch's long frockcoat and baggy trousers were of the precise colour
 of a bear's hide, while, when shuffling across the floor, he made a
 criss-cross motion of the legs, and had, in addition, a constant habit of
 treading upon his companion's toes. As for his face, it was of the warm,
 ardent tint of a piatok <small>23</small>. Persons of this kind?persons
 to whose designing nature has devoted not much thought, and in the
 fashioning of whose frames she has used no instruments so delicate as a
 file or a gimlet and so forth?are not uncommon. Such persons she
 merely roughhews. One cut with a hatchet, and there results a nose;
 another such cut with a hatchet, and there materialises a pair of lips;
 two thrusts with a drill, and there issues a pair of eyes. Lastly,
 scorning to plane down the roughness, she sends out that person into the
 world, saying: "There is another live creature." Sobakevitch was just such
 a ragged, curiously put together figure?though the above model would
 seem to have been followed more in his upper portion than in his lower.
 One result was that he seldom turned his head to look at the person with
 whom he was speaking, but, rather, directed his eyes towards, say, the
 stove corner or the doorway. As host and guest crossed the dining-room
 Chichikov directed a second glance at his companion. "He is a bear, and
 nothing but a bear," he thought to himself. And, indeed, the strange
 comparison was inevitable. Incidentally, Sobakevitch's Christian name and
 patronymic were Michael Semenovitch. Of his habit of treading upon other
 people's toes Chichikov had become fully aware; wherefore he stepped
 cautiously, and, throughout, allowed his host to take the lead. As a
 matter of fact, Sobakevitch himself seemed conscious of his failing, for
 at intervals he would inquire: "I hope I have not hurt you?" and
 Chichikov, with a word of thanks, would reply that as yet he had sustained
 no injury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length they reached the drawing-room, where Sobakevitch pointed to an
 armchair, and invited his guest to be seated. Chichikov gazed with
 interest at the walls and the pictures. In every such picture there were
 portrayed either young men or Greek generals of the type of Movrogordato
 (clad in a red uniform and breaches), Kanaris, and others; and all these
 heroes were depicted with a solidity of thigh and a wealth of moustache
 which made the beholder simply shudder with awe. Among them there were
 placed also, according to some unknown system, and for some unknown
 reason, firstly, Bagration <small>24</small>?tall and thin, and with a
 cluster of small flags and cannon beneath him, and the whole set in the
 narrowest of frames?and, secondly, the Greek heroine, Bobelina,
 whose legs looked larger than do the whole bodies of the drawing-room
 dandies of the present day. Apparently the master of the house was himself
 a man of health and strength, and therefore liked to have his apartments
 adorned with none but folk of equal vigour and robustness. Lastly, in the
 window, and suspected cheek by jowl with Bobelina, there hung a cage
 whence at intervals there peered forth a white-spotted blackbird. Like
 everything else in the apartment, it bore a strong resemblance to
 Sobakevitch. When host and guest had been conversing for two minutes or so
 the door opened, and there entered the hostess?a tall lady in a cap
 adorned with ribands of domestic colouring and manufacture. She entered
 deliberately, and held her head as erect as a palm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is my wife, Theodulia Ivanovna," said Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov approached and took her hand. The fact that she raised it nearly
 to the level of his lips apprised him of the circumstance that it had just
 been rinsed in cucumber oil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear, allow me to introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov," added
 Sobakevitch. "He has the honour of being acquainted both with our Governor
 and with our Postmaster."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this Theodulia Ivanovna requested her guest to be seated, and
 accompanied the invitation with the kind of bow usually employed only by
 actresses who are playing the role of queens. Next, she took a seat upon
 the sofa, drew around her her merino gown, and sat thereafter without
 moving an eyelid or an eyebrow. As for Chichikov, he glanced upwards, and
 once more caught sight of Kanaris with his fat thighs and interminable
 moustache, and of Bobelina and the blackbird. For fully five minutes all
 present preserved a complete silence?the only sound audible being
 that of the blackbird's beak against the wooden floor of the cage as the
 creature fished for grains of corn. Meanwhile Chichikov again surveyed the
 room, and saw that everything in it was massive and clumsy in the highest
 degree; as also that everything was curiously in keeping with the master
 of the house. For example, in one corner of the apartment there stood a
 hazelwood bureau with a bulging body on four grotesque legs?the
 perfect image of a bear. Also, the tables and the chairs were of the same
 ponderous, unrestful order, and every single article in the room appeared
 to be saying either, "I, too, am a Sobakevitch," or "I am exactly like
 Sobakevitch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I heard speak of you one day when I was visiting the President of the
 Council," said Chichikov, on perceiving that no one else had a mind to
 begin a conversation. "That was on Thursday last. We had a very pleasant
 evening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, on that occasion I was not there," replied Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a nice man he is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is?" inquired Sobakevitch, gazing into the corner by the stove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The President of the Local Council."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did he seem so to you? True, he is a mason, but he is also the greatest
 fool that the world ever saw."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov started a little at this mordant criticism, but soon pulled
 himself together again, and continued:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course, every man has his weakness. Yet the President seems to be an
 excellent fellow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you think the same of the Governor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Why not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because there exists no greater rogue than he."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? The Governor a rogue?" ejaculated Chichikov, at a loss to
 understand how the official in question could come to be numbered with
 thieves. "Let me say that I should never have guessed it. Permit me also
 to remark that his conduct would hardly seem to bear out your opinion?he
 seems so gentle a man." And in proof of this Chichikov cited the purses
 which the Governor knitted, and also expatiated on the mildness of his
 features.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He has the face of a robber," said Sobakevitch. "Were you to give him a
 knife, and to turn him loose on a turnpike, he would cut your throat for
 two kopecks. And the same with the Vice-Governor. The pair are just Gog
 and Magog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Evidently he is not on good terms with them," thought Chichikov to
 himself. "I had better pass to the Chief of Police, which whom he DOES
 seem to be friendly." Accordingly he added aloud: "For my own part, I
 should give the preference to the Head of the Gendarmery. What a frank,
 outspoken nature he has! And what an element of simplicity does his
 expression contain!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is mean to the core," remarked Sobakevitch coldly. "He will sell you
 and cheat you, and then dine at your table. Yes, I know them all, and
 every one of them is a swindler, and the town a nest of rascals engaged in
 robbing one another. Not a man of the lot is there but would sell Christ.
 Yet stay: ONE decent fellow there is?the Public Prosecutor; though
 even HE, if the truth be told, is little better than a pig."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After these eulogia Chichikov saw that it would be useless to continue
 running through the list of officials?more especially since suddenly
 he had remembered that Sobakevitch was not at any time given to commending
 his fellow man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let us go to luncheon, my dear," put in Theodulia Ivanovna to her spouse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; pray come to table," said Sobakevitch to his guest; whereupon they
 consumed the customary glass of vodka (accompanied by sundry snacks of
 salted cucumber and other dainties) with which Russians, both in town and
 country, preface a meal. Then they filed into the dining-room in the wake
 of the hostess, who sailed on ahead like a goose swimming across a pond.
 The small dining-table was found to be laid for four persons?the
 fourth place being occupied by a lady or a young girl (it would have been
 difficult to say which exactly) who might have been either a relative, the
 housekeeper, or a casual visitor. Certain persons in the world exist, not
 as personalities in themselves, but as spots or specks on the
 personalities of others. Always they are to be seen sitting in the same
 place, and holding their heads at exactly the same angle, so that one
 comes within an ace of mistaking them for furniture, and thinks to oneself
 that never since the day of their birth can they have spoken a single
 word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear," said Sobakevitch, "the cabbage soup is excellent." With that he
 finished his portion, and helped himself to a generous measure of niania
 <small>25</small>?the
 dish which follows shtchi and consists of a sheep's stomach stuffed with
 black porridge, brains, and other things. "What niania this is!" he added
 to Chichikov. "Never would you get such stuff in a town, where one is
 given the devil knows what."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless the Governor keeps a fair table," said Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but do you know what all the stuff is MADE OF?" retorted
 Sobakevitch. "If you DID know you would never touch it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course I am not in a position to say how it is prepared, but at least
 the pork cutlets and the boiled fish seemed excellent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, it might have been thought so; yet I know the way in which such
 things are bought in the market-place. They are bought by some rascal of a
 cook whom a Frenchman has taught how to skin a tomcat and then serve it up
 as hare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ugh! What horrible things you say!" put in Madame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, my dear, that is how things are done, and it is no fault of mine
 that it is so. Moreover, everything that is left over?everything
 that WE (pardon me for mentioning it) cast into the slop-pail?is
 used by such folk for making soup."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Always at table you begin talking like this!" objected his helpmeet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why not?" said Sobakevitch. "I tell you straight that I would not eat
 such nastiness, even had I made it myself. Sugar a frog as much as you
 like, but never shall it pass MY lips. Nor would I swallow an oyster, for
 I know only too well what an oyster may resemble. But have some mutton,
 friend Chichikov. It is shoulder of mutton, and very different stuff from
 the mutton which they cook in noble kitchens?mutton which has been
 kicking about the market-place four days or more. All that sort of cookery
 has been invented by French and German doctors, and I should like to hang
 them for having done so. They go and prescribe diets and a hunger cure as
 though what suits their flaccid German systems will agree with a Russian
 stomach! Such devices are no good at all." Sobakevitch shook his head
 wrathfully. "Fellows like those are for ever talking of civilisation. As
 if THAT sort of thing was civilisation! Phew!" (Perhaps the speaker's
 concluding exclamation would have been even stronger had he not been
 seated at table.) "For myself, I will have none of it. When I eat pork at
 a meal, give me the WHOLE pig; when mutton, the WHOLE sheep; when goose,
 the WHOLE of the bird. Two dishes are better than a thousand, provided
 that one can eat of them as much as one wants."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he proceeded to put precept into practice by taking half the shoulder
 of mutton on to his plate, and then devouring it down to the last morsel
 of gristle and bone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My word!" reflected Chichikov. "The fellow has a pretty good holding
 capacity!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None of it for me," repeated Sobakevitch as he wiped his hands on his
 napkin. "I don't intend to be like a fellow named Plushkin, who owns eight
 hundred souls, yet dines worse than does my shepherd."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is Plushkin?" asked Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A miser," replied Sobakevitch. "Such a miser as never you could imagine.
 Even convicts in prison live better than he does. And he starves his
 servants as well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really?" ejaculated Chichikov, greatly interested. "Should you, then, say
 that he has lost many peasants by death?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly. They keep dying like flies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then how far from here does he reside?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About five versts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only five versts?" exclaimed Chichikov, feeling his heart beating
 joyously. "Ought one, when leaving your gates, to turn to the right or to
 the left?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should be sorry to tell you the way to the house of such a cur," said
 Sobakevitch. "A man had far better go to hell than to Plushkin's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so," responded Chichikov. "My only reason for asking you is that it
 interests me to become acquainted with any and every sort of locality."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the shoulder of mutton there succeeded, in turn, cutlets (each one
 larger than a plate), a turkey of about the size of a calf, eggs, rice,
 pastry, and every conceivable thing which could possibly be put into a
 stomach. There the meal ended. When he rose from table Chichikov felt as
 though a pood's weight were inside him. In the drawing-room the company
 found dessert awaiting them in the shape of pears, plums, and apples; but
 since neither host nor guest could tackle these particular dainties the
 hostess removed them to another room. Taking advantage of her absence,
 Chichikov turned to Sobakevitch (who, prone in an armchair, seemed, after
 his ponderous meal, to be capable of doing little beyond belching and
 grunting?each such grunt or belch necessitating a subsequent signing
 of the cross over the mouth), and intimated to him a desire to have a
 little private conversation concerning a certain matter. At this moment
 the hostess returned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is more dessert," she said. "Pray have a few radishes stewed in
 honey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Later, later," replied Sobakevitch. "Do you go to your room, and Paul
 Ivanovitch and I will take off our coats and have a nap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this the good lady expressed her readiness to send for feather beds
 and cushions, but her husband expressed a preference for slumbering in an
 armchair, and she therefore departed. When she had gone Sobakevitch
 inclined his head in an attitude of willingness to listen to Chichikov's
 business. Our hero began in a sort of detached manner?touching
 lightly upon the subject of the Russian Empire, and expatiating upon the
 immensity of the same, and saying that even the Empire of Ancient Rome had
 been of considerably smaller dimensions. Meanwhile Sobakevitch sat with
 his head drooping.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From that Chichikov went on to remark that, according to the statutes of
 the said Russian Empire (which yielded to none in glory?so much so
 that foreigners marvelled at it), peasants on the census lists who had
 ended their earthly careers were nevertheless, on the rendering of new
 lists, returned equally with the living, to the end that the courts might
 be relieved of a multitude of trifling, useless emendations which might
 complicate the already sufficiently complex mechanism of the State.
 Nevertheless, said Chichikov, the general equity of this measure did not
 obviate a certain amount of annoyance to landowners, since it forced them
 to pay upon a non-living article the tax due upon a living. Hence (our
 hero concluded) he (Chichikov) was prepared, owing to the personal respect
 which he felt for Sobakevitch, to relieve him, in part, of the irksome
 obligation referred to (in passing, it may be said that Chichikov referred
 to his principal point only guardedly, for he called the souls which he
 was seeking not "dead," but "non-existent").
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile Sobakevitch listened with bent head; though something like a
 trace of expression dawned in his face as he did so. Ordinarily his body
 lacked a soul?or, if he did posses a soul, he seemed to keep it
 elsewhere than where it ought to have been; so that, buried beneath
 mountains (as it were) or enclosed within a massive shell, its movements
 produced no sort of agitation on the surface.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" said Chichikov?though not without a certain tremor of
 diffidence as to the possible response.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are after dead souls?" were Sobakevitch's perfectly simple words. He
 spoke without the least surprise in his tone, and much as though the
 conversation had been turning on grain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Chichikov, and then, as before, softened down the
 expression "dead souls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are to be found," said Sobakevitch. "Why should they not be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then of course you will be glad to get rid of any that you may chance to
 have?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I shall have no objection to SELLING them." At this point the
 speaker raised his head a little, for it had struck him that surely the
 would-be buyer must have some advantage in view.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The devil!" thought Chichikov to himself. "Here is he selling the goods
 before I have even had time to utter a word!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what about the price?" he added aloud. "Of course, the articles are
 not of a kind very easy to appraise."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should be sorry to ask too much," said Sobakevitch. "How would a
 hundred roubles per head suit you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What, a hundred roubles per head?" Chichikov stared open-mouthed at his
 host?doubting whether he had heard aright, or whether his host's
 slow-moving tongue might not have inadvertently substituted one word for
 another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Is that too much for you?" said Sobakevitch. Then he added: "What is
 your own price?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My own price? I think that we cannot properly have understood one another?that
 you must have forgotten of what the goods consist. With my hand on my
 heart do I submit that eight grivni per soul would be a handsome, a VERY
 handsome, offer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? Eight grivni?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In my opinion, a higher offer would be impossible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I am not a seller of boots."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; yet you, for your part, will agree that these souls are not live
 human beings?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose you hope to find fools ready to sell you souls on the census
 list for a couple of groats apiece?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, but why do you use the term 'on the census list'? The souls
 themselves have long since passed away, and have left behind them only
 their names. Not to trouble you with any further discussion of the
 subject, I can offer you a rouble and a half per head, but no more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should be ashamed even to mention such a sum! Since you deal in
 articles of this kind, quote me a genuine price."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot, Michael Semenovitch. Believe me, I cannot. What a man cannot
 do, that he cannot do." The speaker ended by advancing another half-rouble
 per head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why hang back with your money?" said Sobakevitch. "Of a truth I am
 not asking much of you. Any other rascal than myself would have cheated
 you by selling you old rubbish instead of good, genuine souls, whereas I
 should be ready to give you of my best, even were you buying only
 nut-kernels. For instance, look at wheelwright Michiev. Never was there
 such a one to build spring carts! And his handiwork was not like your
 Moscow handiwork?good only for an hour. No, he did it all himself,
 even down to the varnishing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov opened his mouth to remark that, nevertheless, the said Michiev
 had long since departed this world; but Sobakevitch's eloquence had got
 too thoroughly into its stride to admit of any interruption.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And look, too, at Probka Stepan, the carpenter," his host went on. "I
 will wager my head that nowhere else would you find such a workman. What a
 strong fellow he was! He had served in the Guards, and the Lord only knows
 what they had given for him, seeing that he was over three arshins in
 height."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again Chichikov tried to remark that Probka was dead, but Sobakevitch's
 tongue was borne on the torrent of its own verbiage, and the only thing to
 be done was to listen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Milushkin, the bricklayer! He could build a stove in any house you
 liked! And Maksim Teliatnikov, the bootmaker! Anything that he drove his
 awl into became a pair of boots?and boots for which you would be
 thankful, although he WAS a bit foul of the mouth. And Eremi
 Sorokoplechin, too! He was the best of the lot, and used to work at his
 trade in Moscow, where he paid a tax of five hundred roubles. Well,
 THERE'S an assortment of serfs for you!?a very different assortment
 from what Plushkin would sell you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But permit me," at length put in Chichikov, astounded at this flood of
 eloquence to which there appeared to be no end. "Permit me, I say, to
 inquire why you enumerate the talents of the deceased, seeing that they
 are all of them dead, and that therefore there can be no sense in doing
 so. 'A dead body is only good to prop a fence with,' says the proverb."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course they are dead," replied Sobakevitch, but rather as though the
 idea had only just occurred to him, and was giving him food for thought.
 "But tell me, now: what is the use of listing them as still alive? And
 what is the use of them themselves? They are flies, not human beings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Chichikov, "they exist, though only in idea."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But no?NOT only in idea. I tell you that nowhere else would you
 find such a fellow for working heavy tools as was Michiev. He had the
 strength of a horse in his shoulders." And, with the words, Sobakevitch
 turned, as though for corroboration, to the portrait of Bagration, as is
 frequently done by one of the parties in a dispute when he purports to
 appeal to an extraneous individual who is not only unknown to him, but
 wholly unconnected with the subject in hand; with the result that the
 individual is left in doubt whether to make a reply, or whether to betake
 himself elsewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless, I CANNOT give you more than two roubles per head," said
 Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, as I don't want you to swear that I have asked too much of you and
 won't meet you halfway, suppose, for friendship's sake, that you pay me
 seventy-five roubles in assignats?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good heavens!" thought Chichikov to himself. "Does the man take me for a
 fool?" Then he added aloud: "The situation seems to me a strange one, for
 it is as though we were performing a stage comedy. No other explanation
 would meet the case. Yet you appear to be a man of sense, and possessed of
 some education. The matter is a very simple one. The question is: what is
 a dead soul worth, and is it of any use to any one?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is of use to YOU, or you would not be buying such articles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov bit his lip, and stood at a loss for a retort. He tried to
 saying something about "family and domestic circumstances," but
 Sobakevitch cut him short with:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to know your private affairs, for I never poke my nose into
 such things. You need the souls, and I am ready to sell them. Should you
 not buy them, I think you will repent it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two roubles is my price," repeated Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come! As you have named that sum, I can understand your not liking
 to go back upon it; but quote me a bona fide figure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The devil fly away with him!" mused Chichikov. "However, I will add
 another half-rouble." And he did so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed?" said Sobakevitch. "Well, my last word upon it is?fifty
 roubles in assignats. That will mean a sheer loss to me, for nowhere else
 in the world could you buy better souls than mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The old skinflint!" muttered Chichikov. Then he added aloud, with
 irritation in his tone: "See here. This is a serious matter. Any one but
 you would be thankful to get rid of the souls. Only a fool would stick to
 them, and continue to pay the tax."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but remember (and I say it wholly in a friendly way) that
 transactions of this kind are not generally allowed, and that any one
 would say that a man who engages in them must have some rather doubtful
 advantage in view."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have it your own away," said Chichikov, with assumed indifference. "As a
 matter of fact, I am not purchasing for profit, as you suppose, but to
 humour a certain whim of mine. Two and a half roubles is the most that I
 can offer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bless your heart!" retorted the host. "At least give me thirty roubles in
 assignats, and take the lot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, for I see that you are unwilling to sell. I must say good-day to
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on, hold on!" exclaimed Sobakevitch, retaining his guest's hand, and
 at the same moment treading heavily upon his toes?so heavily,
 indeed, that Chichikov gasped and danced with the pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I BEG your pardon!" said Sobakevitch hastily. "Evidently I have hurt you.
 Pray sit down again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," retorted Chichikov. "I am merely wasting my time, and must be off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, sit down just for a moment. I have something more agreeable to say."
 And, drawing closer to his guest, Sobakevitch whispered in his ear, as
 though communicating to him a secret: "How about twenty-five roubles?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, no!" exclaimed Chichikov. "I won't give you even a QUARTER of
 that. I won't advance another kopeck."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a while Sobakevitch remained silent, and Chichikov did the same. This
 lasted for a couple of minutes, and, meanwhile, the aquiline-nosed
 Bagration gazed from the wall as though much interested in the bargaining.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is your outside price?" at length said Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two and a half roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you seem to rate a human soul at about the same value as a boiled
 turnip. At least give me THREE roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I cannot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, but you are an impossible man to deal with. However, even
 though it will mean a dead loss to me, and you have not shown a very nice
 spirit about it, I cannot well refuse to please a friend. I suppose a
 purchase deed had better be made out in order to have everything in
 order?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then for that purpose let us repair to the town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The affair ended in their deciding to do this on the morrow, and to
 arrange for the signing of a deed of purchase. Next, Chichikov requested a
 list of the peasants; to which Sobakevitch readily agreed. Indeed, he went
 to his writing-desk then and there, and started to indite a list which
 gave not only the peasants' names, but also their late qualifications.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile Chichikov, having nothing else to do, stood looking at the
 spacious form of his host; and as he gazed at his back as broad as that of
 a cart horse, and at the legs as massive as the iron standards which adorn
 a street, he could not help inwardly ejaculating:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Truly God has endowed you with much! Though not adjusted with nicety, at
 least you are strongly built. I wonder whether you were born a bear or
 whether you have come to it through your rustic life, with its tilling of
 crops and its trading with peasants? Yet no; I believe that, even if you
 had received a fashionable education, and had mixed with society, and had
 lived in St. Petersburg, you would still have been just the kulak <small>26</small>
 that you are. The only difference is that circumstances, as they stand,
 permit of your polishing off a stuffed shoulder of mutton at a meal;
 whereas in St. Petersburg you would have been unable to do so. Also, as
 circumstances stand, you have under you a number of peasants, whom you
 treat well for the reason that they are your property; whereas, otherwise,
 you would have had under you tchinovniks <small>27</small>: whom you
 would have bullied because they were NOT your property. Also, you would
 have robbed the Treasury, since a kulak always remains a money-grubber."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The list is ready," said Sobakevitch, turning round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? Then please let me look at it." Chichikov ran his eye over the
 document, and could not but marvel at its neatness and accuracy. Not only
 were there set forth in it the trade, the age, and the pedigree of every
 serf, but on the margin of the sheet were jotted remarks concerning each
 serf's conduct and sobriety. Truly it was a pleasure to look at it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you mind handing me the earnest money?" said Sobakevitch?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I do. Why need that be done? You can receive the money in a lump sum
 as soon as we visit the town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is always the custom, you know," asserted Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I cannot follow it, for I have no money with me. However, here are
 ten roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ten roubles, indeed? You might as well hand me fifty while you are about
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more Chichikov started to deny that he had any money upon him, but
 Sobakevitch insisted so strongly that this was not so that at length the
 guest pulled out another fifteen roubles, and added them to the ten
 already produced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kindly give me a receipt for the money," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A receipt? Why should I give you a receipt?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because it is better to do so, in order to guard against mistakes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well; but first hand me over the money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The money? I have it here. Do you write out the receipt, and then the
 money shall be yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, but how am I to write out the receipt before I have seen the
 cash?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov placed the notes in Sobakevitch's hand; whereupon the host moved
 nearer to the table, and added to the list of serfs a note that he had
 received for the peasants, therewith sold, the sum of twenty-five roubles,
 as earnest money. This done, he counted the notes once more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is a very OLD note," he remarked, holding one up to the light.
 "Also, it is a trifle torn. However, in a friendly transaction one must
 not be too particular."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a kulak!" thought Chichikov to himself. "And what a brute beast!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you do not want any WOMEN souls?" queried Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thank you, no."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I could let you have some cheap?say, as between friends, at a
 rouble a head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I should have no use for them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, that being so, there is no more to be said. There is no accounting
 for tastes. 'One man loves the priest, and another the priest's wife,'
 says the proverb."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov rose to take his leave. "Once more I would request of you," he
 said, "that the bargain be left as it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course, of course. What is done between friends holds good because of
 their mutual friendship. Good-bye, and thank you for your visit. In
 advance I would beg that, whenever you should have an hour or two to
 spare, you will come and lunch with us again. Perhaps we might be able to
 do one another further service?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not if I know it!" reflected Chichikov as he mounted his britchka. "Not
 I, seeing that I have had two and a half roubles per soul squeezed out of
 me by a brute of a kulak!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Altogether he felt dissatisfied with Sobakevitch's behaviour. In spite of
 the man being a friend of the Governor and the Chief of Police, he had
 acted like an outsider in taking money for what was worthless rubbish. As
 the britchka left the courtyard Chichikov glanced back and saw Sobakevitch
 still standing on the verandah?apparently for the purpose of
 watching to see which way the guest's carriage would turn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The old villain, to be still standing there!" muttered Chichikov through
 his teeth; after which he ordered Selifan to proceed so that the vehicle's
 progress should be invisible from the mansion?the truth being that
 he had a mind next to visit Plushkin (whose serfs, to quote Sobakevitch,
 had a habit of dying like flies), but not to let his late host learn of
 his intention. Accordingly, on reaching the further end of the village, he
 hailed the first peasant whom he saw?a man who was in the act of
 hoisting a ponderous beam on to his shoulder before setting off with it,
 ant-like, to his hut.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hi!" shouted Chichikov. "How can I reach landowner Plushkin's place
 without first going past the mansion here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The peasant seemed nonplussed by the question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you know?" queried Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, barin," replied the peasant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? You don't know skinflint Plushkin who feeds his people so badly?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course I do!" exclaimed the fellow, and added thereto an
 uncomplimentary expression of a species not ordinarily employed in polite
 society. We may guess that it was a pretty apt expression, since long
 after the man had become lost to view Chichikov was still laughing in his
 britchka. And, indeed, the language of the Russian populace is always
 forcible in its phraseology.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Chichikov's amusement at the peasant's outburst prevented him from
 noticing that he had reached the centre of a large and populous village;
 but, presently, a violent jolt aroused him to the fact that he was driving
 over wooden pavements of a kind compared with which the cobblestones of
 the town had been as nothing. Like the keys of a piano, the planks kept
 rising and falling, and unguarded passage over them entailed either a bump
 on the back of the neck or a bruise on the forehead or a bite on the tip
 of one's tongue. At the same time Chichikov noticed a look of decay about
 the buildings of the village. The beams of the huts had grown dark with
 age, many of their roofs were riddled with holes, others had but a tile of
 the roof remaining, and yet others were reduced to the rib-like framework
 of the same. It would seem as though the inhabitants themselves had
 removed the laths and traverses, on the very natural plea that the huts
 were no protection against the rain, and therefore, since the latter
 entered in bucketfuls, there was no particular object to be gained by
 sitting in such huts when all the time there was the tavern and the
 highroad and other places to resort to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly a woman appeared from an outbuilding?apparently the
 housekeeper of the mansion, but so roughly and dirtily dressed as almost
 to seem indistinguishable from a man. Chichikov inquired for the master of
 the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is not at home," she replied, almost before her interlocutor had had
 time to finish. Then she added: "What do you want with him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have some business to do," said Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then pray walk into the house," the woman advised. Then she turned upon
 him a back that was smeared with flour and had a long slit in the lower
 portion of its covering. Entering a large, dark hall which reeked like a
 tomb, he passed into an equally dark parlour that was lighted only by such
 rays as contrived to filter through a crack under the door. When Chichikov
 opened the door in question, the spectacle of the untidiness within struck
 him almost with amazement. It would seem that the floor was never washed,
 and that the room was used as a receptacle for every conceivable kind of
 furniture. On a table stood a ragged chair, with, beside it, a clock minus
 a pendulum and covered all over with cobwebs. Against a wall leant a
 cupboard, full of old silver, glassware, and china. On a writing table,
 inlaid with mother-of-pearl which, in places, had broken away and left
 behind it a number of yellow grooves (stuffed with putty), lay a pile of
 finely written manuscript, an overturned marble press (turning green), an
 ancient book in a leather cover with red edges, a lemon dried and shrunken
 to the dimensions of a hazelnut, the broken arm of a chair, a tumbler
 containing the dregs of some liquid and three flies (the whole covered
 over with a sheet of notepaper), a pile of rags, two ink-encrusted pens,
 and a yellow toothpick with which the master of the house had picked his
 teeth (apparently) at least before the coming of the French to Moscow. As
 for the walls, they were hung with a medley of pictures. Among the latter
 was a long engraving of a battle scene, wherein soldiers in three-cornered
 hats were brandishing huge drums and slender lances. It lacked a glass,
 and was set in a frame ornamented with bronze fretwork and bronze corner
 rings. Beside it hung a huge, grimy oil painting representative of some
 flowers and fruit, half a water melon, a boar's head, and the pendent form
 of a dead wild duck. Attached to the ceiling there was a chandelier in a
 holland covering?the covering so dusty as closely to resemble a huge
 cocoon enclosing a caterpillar. Lastly, in one corner of the room lay a
 pile of articles which had evidently been adjudged unworthy of a place on
 the table. Yet what the pile consisted of it would have been difficult to
 say, seeing that the dust on the same was so thick that any hand which
 touched it would have at once resembled a glove. Prominently protruding
 from the pile was the shaft of a wooden spade and the antiquated sole of a
 shoe. Never would one have supposed that a living creature had tenanted
 the room, were it not that the presence of such a creature was betrayed by
 the spectacle of an old nightcap resting on the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst Chichikov was gazing at this extraordinary mess, a side door opened
 and there entered the housekeeper who had met him near the outbuildings.
 But now Chichikov perceived this person to be a man rather than a woman,
 since a female housekeeper would have had no beard to shave, whereas the
 chin of the newcomer, with the lower portion of his cheeks, strongly
 resembled the curry-comb which is used for grooming horses. Chichikov
 assumed a questioning air, and waited to hear what the housekeeper might
 have to say. The housekeeper did the same. At length, surprised at the
 misunderstanding, Chichikov decided to ask the first question.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is the master at home?" he inquired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied the person addressed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then were is he?" continued Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you blind, my good sir?" retorted the other. "<i>I</i> am the
 master."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Involuntarily our hero started and stared. During his travels it had
 befallen him to meet various types of men?some of them, it may be,
 types which you and I have never encountered; but even to Chichikov this
 particular species was new. In the old man's face there was nothing very
 special?it was much like the wizened face of many another dotard,
 save that the chin was so greatly projected that whenever he spoke he was
 forced to wipe it with a handkerchief to avoid dribbling, and that his
 small eyes were not yet grown dull, but twinkled under their overhanging
 brows like the eyes of mice when, with attentive ears and sensitive
 whiskers, they snuff the air and peer forth from their holes to see
 whether a cat or a boy may not be in the vicinity. No, the most noticeable
 feature about the man was his clothes. In no way could it have been
 guessed of what his coat was made, for both its sleeves and its skirts
 were so ragged and filthy as to defy description, while instead of two
 posterior tails, there dangled four of those appendages, with, projecting
 from them, a torn newspaper. Also, around his neck there was wrapped
 something which might have been a stocking, a garter, or a stomacher, but
 was certainly not a tie. In short, had Chichikov chanced to encounter him
 at a church door, he would have bestowed upon him a copper or two (for, to
 do our hero justice, he had a sympathetic heart and never refrained from
 presenting a beggar with alms), but in the present case there was standing
 before him, not a mendicant, but a landowner?and a landowner
 possessed of fully a thousand serfs, the superior of all his neighbours in
 wealth of flour and grain, and the owner of storehouses, and so forth,
 that were crammed with homespun cloth and linen, tanned and undressed
 sheepskins, dried fish, and every conceivable species of produce.
 Nevertheless, such a phenomenon is rare in Russia, where the tendency is
 rather to prodigality than to parsimony.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For several minutes Plushkin stood mute, while Chichikov remained so dazed
 with the appearance of the host and everything else in the room, that he
 too, could not begin a conversation, but stood wondering how best to find
 words in which to explain the object of his visit. For a while he thought
 of expressing himself to the effect that, having heard so much of his
 host's benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit, he had considered
 it his duty to come and pay a tribute of respect; but presently even HE
 came to the conclusion that this would be overdoing the thing, and, after
 another glance round the room, decided that the phrase "benevolence and
 other rare qualities of spirit" might to advantage give place to "economy
 and genius for method." Accordingly, the speech mentally composed, he said
 aloud that, having heard of Plushkin's talents for thrifty and systematic
 management, he had considered himself bound to make the acquaintance of
 his host, and to present him with his personal compliments (I need hardly
 say that Chichikov could easily have alleged a better reason, had any
 better one happened, at the moment, to have come into his head).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With toothless gums Plushkin murmured something in reply, but nothing is
 known as to its precise terms beyond that it included a statement that the
 devil was at liberty to fly away with Chichikov's sentiments. However, the
 laws of Russian hospitality do not permit even of a miser infringing their
 rules; wherefore Plushkin added to the foregoing a more civil invitation
 to be seated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is long since I last received a visitor," he went on. "Also, I feel
 bound to say that I can see little good in their coming. Once introduce
 the abominable custom of folk paying calls, and forthwith there will ensue
 such ruin to the management of estates that landowners will be forced to
 feed their horses on hay. Not for a long, long time have I eaten a meal
 away from home?although my own kitchen is a poor one, and has its
 chimney in such a state that, were it to become overheated, it would
 instantly catch fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a brute!" thought Chichikov. "I am lucky to have got through so much
 pastry and stuffed shoulder of mutton at Sobakevitch's!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Also," went on Plushkin, "I am ashamed to say that hardly a wisp of
 fodder does the place contain. But how can I get fodder? My lands are
 small, and the peasantry lazy fellows who hate work and think of nothing
 but the tavern. In the end, therefore, I shall be forced to go and spend
 my old age in roaming about the world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I have been told that you possess over a thousand serfs?" said
 Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told you that? No matter who it was, you would have been justified in
 giving him the lie. He must have been a jester who wanted to make a fool
 of you. A thousand souls, indeed! Why, just reckon the taxes on them, and
 see what there would be left! For these three years that accursed fever
 has been killing off my serfs wholesale."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wholesale, you say?" echoed Chichikov, greatly interested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, wholesale," replied the old man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then might I ask you the exact number?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fully eighty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Surely not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it is so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then might I also ask whether it is from the date of the last census
 revision that you are reckoning these souls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, damn it! And since that date I have been bled for taxes upon a
 hundred and twenty souls in all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? Upon a hundred and twenty souls in all!" And Chichikov's surprise
 and elation were such that, this said, he remained sitting open-mouthed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, good sir," replied Plushkin. "I am too old to tell you lies, for I
 have passed my seventieth year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somehow he seemed to have taken offence at Chichikov's almost joyous
 exclamation; wherefore the guest hastened to heave a profound sigh, and to
 observe that he sympathised to the full with his host's misfortunes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But sympathy does not put anything into one's pocket," retorted Plushkin.
 "For instance, I have a kinsman who is constantly plaguing me. He is a
 captain in the army, damn him, and all day he does nothing but call me
 'dear uncle,' and kiss my hand, and express sympathy until I am forced to
 stop my ears. You see, he has squandered all his money upon his
 brother-officers, as well as made a fool of himself with an actress; so
 now he spends his time in telling me that he has a sympathetic heart!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov hastened to explain that HIS sympathy had nothing in common with
 the captain's, since he dealt, not in empty words alone, but in actual
 deeds; in proof of which he was ready then and there (for the purpose of
 cutting the matter short, and of dispensing with circumlocution) to
 transfer to himself the obligation of paying the taxes due upon such serfs
 as Plushkin's as had, in the unfortunate manner just described, departed
 this world. The proposal seemed to astonish Plushkin, for he sat staring
 open-eyed. At length he inquired:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear sir, have you seen military service?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied the other warily, "but I have been a member of the CIVIL
 Service."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Of the CIVIL Service?" And Plushkin sat moving his lips as though he
 were chewing something. "Well, what of your proposal?" he added presently.
 "Are you prepared to lose by it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, certainly, if thereby I can please you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear sir! My good benefactor!" In his delight Plushkin lost sight of
 the fact that his nose was caked with snuff of the consistency of thick
 coffee, and that his coat had parted in front and was disclosing some very
 unseemly underclothing. "What comfort you have brought to an old man! Yes,
 as God is my witness!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For the moment he could say no more. Yet barely a minute had elapsed
 before this instantaneously aroused emotion had, as instantaneously,
 disappeared from his wooden features. Once more they assumed a careworn
 expression, and he even wiped his face with his handkerchief, then rolled
 it into a ball, and rubbed it to and fro against his upper lip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it will not annoy you again to state the proposal," he went on, "what
 you undertake to do is to pay the annual tax upon these souls, and to
 remit the money either to me or to the Treasury?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that is how it shall be done. We will draw up a deed of purchase as
 though the souls were still alive and you had sold them to myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so?a deed of purchase," echoed Plushkin, once more relapsing
 into thought and the chewing motion of the lips. "But a deed of such a
 kind will entail certain expenses, and lawyers are so devoid of
 conscience! In fact, so extortionate is their avarice that they will
 charge one half a rouble, and then a sack of flour, and then a whole
 waggon-load of meal. I wonder that no one has yet called attention to the
 system."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that Chichikov intimated that, out of respect for his host, he
 himself would bear the cost of the transfer of souls. This led Plushkin to
 conclude that his guest must be the kind of unconscionable fool who, while
 pretending to have been a member of the Civil Service, has in reality
 served in the army and run after actresses; wherefore the old man no
 longer disguised his delight, but called down blessings alike upon
 Chichikov's head and upon those of his children (he had never even
 inquired whether Chichikov possessed a family). Next, he shuffled to the
 window, and, tapping one of its panes, shouted the name of "Proshka."
 Immediately some one ran quickly into the hall, and, after much stamping
 of feet, burst into the room. This was Proshka?a thirteen-year-old
 youngster who was shod with boots of such dimensions as almost to engulf
 his legs as he walked. The reason why he had entered thus shod was that
 Plushkin only kept one pair of boots for the whole of his domestic staff.
 This universal pair was stationed in the hall of the mansion, so that any
 servant who was summoned to the house might don the said boots after
 wading barefooted through the mud of the courtyard, and enter the parlour
 dry-shod?subsequently leaving the boots where he had found them, and
 departing in his former barefooted condition. Indeed, had any one, on a
 slushy winter's morning, glanced from a window into the said courtyard, he
 would have seen Plushkin's servitors performing saltatory feats worthy of
 the most vigorous of stage-dancers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at that boy's face!" said Plushkin to Chichikov as he pointed to
 Proshka. "It is stupid enough, yet, lay anything aside, and in a trice he
 will have stolen it. Well, my lad, what do you want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He paused a moment or two, but Proshka made no reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, come!" went on the old man. "Set out the samovar, and then give
 Mavra the key of the store-room?here it is?and tell her to get
 out some loaf sugar for tea. Here! Wait another moment, fool! Is the devil
 in your legs that they itch so to be off? Listen to what more I have to
 tell you. Tell Mavra that the sugar on the outside of the loaf has gone
 bad, so that she must scrape it off with a knife, and NOT throw away the
 scrapings, but give them to the poultry. Also, see that you yourself don't
 go into the storeroom, or I will give you a birching that you won't care
 for. Your appetite is good enough already, but a better one won't hurt
 you. Don't even TRY to go into the storeroom, for I shall be watching you
 from this window."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see," the old man added to Chichikov, "one can never trust these
 fellows." Presently, when Proshka and the boots had departed, he fell to
 gazing at his guest with an equally distrustful air, since certain
 features in Chichikov's benevolence now struck him as a little open to
 question, and he had begin to think to himself: "After all, the devil only
 knows who he is?whether a braggart, like most of these spendthrifts,
 or a fellow who is lying merely in order to get some tea out of me."
 Finally, his circumspection, combined with a desire to test his guest, led
 him to remark that it might be well to complete the transaction
 IMMEDIATELY, since he had not overmuch confidence in humanity, seeing that
 a man might be alive to-day and dead to-morrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this Chichikov assented readily enough?merely adding that he
 should like first of all to be furnished with a list of the dead souls.
 This reassured Plushkin as to his guest's intention of doing business, so
 he got out his keys, approached a cupboard, and, having pulled back the
 door, rummaged among the cups and glasses with which it was filled. At
 length he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot find it now, but I used to possess a splendid bottle of liquor.
 Probably the servants have drunk it all, for they are such thieves. Oh no:
 perhaps this is it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Looking up, Chichikov saw that Plushkin had extracted a decanter coated
 with dust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My late wife made the stuff," went on the old man, "but that rascal of a
 housekeeper went and threw away a lot of it, and never even replaced the
 stopper. Consequently bugs and other nasty creatures got into the
 decanter, but I cleaned it out, and now beg to offer you a glassful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The idea of a drink from such a receptacle was too much for Chichikov, so
 he excused himself on the ground that he had just had luncheon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have just had luncheon?" re-echoed Plushkin. "Now, THAT shows how
 invariably one can tell a man of good society, wheresoever one may be. A
 man of that kind never eats anything?he always says that he has had
 enough. Very different that from the ways of a rogue, whom one can never
 satisfy, however much one may give him. For instance, that captain of mine
 is constantly begging me to let him have a meal?though he is about
 as much my nephew as I am his grandfather. As it happens, there is never a
 bite of anything in the house, so he has to go away empty. But about the
 list of those good-for-nothing souls?I happen to possess such a
 list, since I have drawn one up in readiness for the next revision."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that Plushkin donned his spectacles, and once more started to rummage
 in the cupboard, and to smother his guest with dust as he untied
 successive packages of papers?so much so that his victim burst out
 sneezing. Finally he extracted a much-scribbled document in which the
 names of the deceased peasants lay as close-packed as a cloud of midges,
 for there were a hundred and twenty of them in all. Chichikov grinned with
 joy at the sight of the multitude. Stuffing the list into his pocket, he
 remarked that, to complete the transaction, it would be necessary to
 return to the town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the town?" repeated Plushkin. "But why? Moreover, how could I leave
 the house, seeing that every one of my servants is either a thief or a
 rogue? Day by day they pilfer things, until soon I shall have not a single
 coat to hang on my back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you possess acquaintances in the town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Acquaintances? No. Every acquaintance whom I ever possessed has either
 left me or is dead. But stop a moment. I DO know the President of the
 Council. Even in my old age he has once or twice come to visit me, for he
 and I used to be schoolfellows, and to go climbing walls together. Yes,
 him I do know. Shall I write him a letter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By all means."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, him I know well, for we were friends together at school."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Over Plushkin's wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth?a
 ray which expressed, if not feeling, at all events feeling's pale
 reflection. Just such a phenomenon may be witnessed when, for a brief
 moment, a drowning man makes a last re-appearance on the surface of a
 river, and there rises from the crowd lining the banks a cry of hope that
 even yet the exhausted hands may clutch the rope which has been thrown him?may
 clutch it before the surface of the unstable element shall have resumed
 for ever its calm, dread vacuity. But the hope is short-lived, and the
 hands disappear. Even so did Plushkin's face, after its momentary
 manifestation of feeling, become meaner and more insensible than ever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There used to be a sheet of clean writing paper lying on the table," he
 went on. "But where it is now I cannot think. That comes of my servants
 being such rascals."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whit that he fell to looking also under the table, as well as to hurrying
 about with cries of "Mavra, Mavra!" At length the call was answered by a
 woman with a plateful of the sugar of which mention has been made;
 whereupon there ensued the following conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What have you done with my piece of writing paper, you pilferer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I swear that I have seen no paper except the bit with which you covered
 the glass."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your very face tells me that you have made off with it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why should I make off with it? 'Twould be of no use to me, for I can
 neither read nor write."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You lie! You have taken it away for the sexton to scribble upon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if the sexton wanted paper he could get some for himself. Neither
 he nor I have set eyes upon your piece."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! Wait a bit, for on the Judgment Day you will be roasted by devils on
 iron spits. Just see if you are not!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why should I be roasted when I have never even TOUCHED the paper? You
 might accuse me of any other fault than theft."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nay, devils shall roast you, sure enough. They will say to you, 'Bad
 woman, we are doing this because you robbed your master,' and then stoke
 up the fire still hotter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless <i>I</i> shall continue to say, 'You are roasting me for
 nothing, for I never stole anything at all.' Why, THERE it is, lying on
 the table! You have been accusing me for no reason whatever!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, sure enough, the sheet of paper was lying before Plushkin's very
 eyes. For a moment or two he chewed silently. Then he went on:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, and what are you making such a noise about? If one says a single
 word to you, you answer back with ten. Go and fetch me a candle to seal a
 letter with. And mind you bring a TALLOW candle, for it will not cost so
 much as the other sort. And bring me a match too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mavra departed, and Plushkin, seating himself, and taking up a pen, sat
 turning the sheet of paper over and over, as though in doubt whether to
 tear from it yet another morsel. At length he came to the conclusion that
 it was impossible to do so, and therefore, dipping the pen into the
 mixture of mouldy fluid and dead flies which the ink bottle contained,
 started to indite the letter in characters as bold as the notes of a music
 score, while momentarily checking the speed of his hand, lest it should
 meander too much over the paper, and crawling from line to line as though
 he regretted that there was so little vacant space left on the sheet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you happen to know any one to whom a few runaway serfs would be of
 use?" he asked as subsequently he folded the letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? You have some runaways as well?" exclaimed Chichikov, again greatly
 interested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly I have. My son-in-law has laid the necessary information
 against them, but says that their tracks have grown cold. However, he is
 only a military man?that is to say, good at clinking a pair of
 spurs, but of no use for laying a plea before a court."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how many runaways have you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About seventy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Surely not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Alas, yes. Never does a year pass without a certain number of them making
 off. Yet so gluttonous and idle are my serfs that they are simply bursting
 with food, whereas I scarcely get enough to eat. I will take any price for
 them that you may care to offer. Tell your friends about it, and, should
 they find even a score of the runaways, it will repay them handsomely,
 seeing that a living serf on the census list is at present worth five
 hundred roubles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps so, but I am not going to let any one but myself have a finger in
 this," thought Chichikov to himself; after which he explained to Plushkin
 that a friend of the kind mentioned would be impossible to discover, since
 the legal expenses of the enterprise would lead to the said friend having
 to cut the very tail from his coat before he would get clear of the
 lawyers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless," added Chichikov, "seeing that you are so hard pressed for
 money, and that I am so interested in the matter, I feel moved to advance
 you?well, to advance you such a trifle as would scarcely be worth
 mentioning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how much is it?" asked Plushkin eagerly, and with his hands trembling
 like quicksilver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Twenty-five kopecks per soul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? In ready money?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?in money down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless, consider my poverty, dear friend, and make it FORTY kopecks
 per soul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Venerable sir, would that I could pay you not merely forty kopecks, but
 five hundred roubles. I should be only too delighted if that were
 possible, since I perceive that you, an aged and respected gentleman, are
 suffering for your own goodness of heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By God, that is true, that is true." Plushkin hung his head, and wagged
 it feebly from side to side. "Yes, all that I have done I have done purely
 out of kindness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See how instantaneously I have divined your nature! By now it will have
 become clear to you why it is impossible for me to pay you five hundred
 roubles per runaway soul: for by now you will have gathered the fact that
 I am not sufficiently rich. Nevertheless, I am ready to add another five
 kopecks, and so to make it that each runaway serf shall cost me, in all,
 thirty kopecks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As you please, dear sir. Yet stretch another point, and throw in another
 two kopecks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pardon me, but I cannot. How many runaway serfs did you say that you
 possess? Seventy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; seventy-eight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seventy-eight souls at thirty kopecks each will amount to?to?"
 only for a moment did our hero halt, since he was strong in his
 arithmetic, "?will amount to twenty-four roubles, ninety-six
 kopecks." <small>28</small>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that he requested Plushkin to make out the receipt, and then handed
 him the money. Plushkin took it in both hands, bore it to a bureau with as
 much caution as though he were carrying a liquid which might at any moment
 splash him in the face, and, arrived at the bureau, and glancing round
 once more, carefully packed the cash in one of his money bags, where,
 doubtless, it was destined to lie buried until, to the intense joy of his
 daughters and his son-in-law (and, perhaps, of the captain who claimed
 kinship with him), he should himself receive burial at the hands of
 Fathers Carp and Polycarp, the two priests attached to his village.
 Lastly, the money concealed, Plushkin re-seated himself in the armchair,
 and seemed at a loss for further material for conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you thinking of starting?" at length he inquired, on seeing Chichikov
 making a trifling movement, though the movement was only to extract from
 his pocket a handkerchief. Nevertheless the question reminded Chichikov
 that there was no further excuse for lingering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I must be going," he said as he took his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then what about the tea?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, I will have some on my next visit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? Even though I have just ordered the samovar to be got ready? Well,
 well! I myself do not greatly care for tea, for I think it an expensive
 beverage. Moreover, the price of sugar has risen terribly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Proshka!" he then shouted. "The samovar will not be needed. Return the
 sugar to Mavra, and tell her to put it back again. But no. Bring the sugar
 here, and <i>I</i> will put it back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, dear sir," finally he added to Chichikov. "May the Lord bless
 you! Hand that letter to the President of the Council, and let him read
 it. Yes, he is an old friend of mine. We knew one another as
 schoolfellows."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that this strange phenomenon, this withered old man, escorted his
 guest to the gates of the courtyard, and, after the guest had departed,
 ordered the gates to be closed, made the round of the outbuildings for the
 purpose of ascertaining whether the numerous watchmen were at their posts,
 peered into the kitchen (where, under the pretence of seeing whether his
 servants were being properly fed, he made a light meal of cabbage soup and
 gruel), rated the said servants soundly for their thievishness and general
 bad behaviour, and then returned to his room. Meditating in solitude, he
 fell to thinking how best he could contrive to recompense his guest for
 the latter's measureless benevolence. "I will present him," he thought to
 himself, "with a watch. It is a good silver article?not one of those
 cheap metal affairs; and though it has suffered some damage, he can easily
 get that put right. A young man always needs to give a watch to his
 betrothed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he added after further thought. "I will leave him the watch in my
 will, as a keepsake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile our hero was bowling along in high spirit. Such an unexpected
 acquisition both of dead souls and of runaway serfs had come as a
 windfall. Even before reaching Plushkin's village he had had a
 presentiment that he would do successful business there, but not business
 of such pre-eminent profitableness as had actually resulted. As he
 proceeded he whistled, hummed with hand placed trumpetwise to his mouth,
 and ended by bursting into a burst of melody so striking that Selifan,
 after listening for a while, nodded his head and exclaimed, "My word, but
 the master CAN sing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time they reached the town darkness had fallen, and changed the
 character of the scene. The britchka bounded over the cobblestones, and at
 length turned into the hostelry's courtyard, where the travellers were met
 by Petrushka. With one hand holding back the tails of his coat (which he
 never liked to see fly apart), the valet assisted his master to alight.
 The waiter ran out with candle in hand and napkin on shoulder. Whether or
 not Petrushka was glad to see the barin return it is impossible to say,
 but at all events he exchanged a wink with Selifan, and his ordinarily
 morose exterior seemed momentarily to brighten.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you have been travelling far, sir?" said the waiter, as he lit the
 way upstarts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Chichikov. "What has happened here in the meanwhile?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing, sir," replied the waiter, bowing, "except that last night there
 arrived a military lieutenant. He has got room number sixteen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A lieutenant?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. He came from Riazan, driving three grey horses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On entering his room, Chichikov clapped his hand to his nose, and asked
 his valet why he had never had the windows opened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I did have them opened," replied Petrushka. Nevertheless this was a
 lie, as Chichikov well knew, though he was too tired to contest the point.
 After ordering and consuming a light supper of sucking pig, he undressed,
 plunged beneath the bedclothes, and sank into the profound slumber which
 comes only to such fortunate folk as are troubled neither with mosquitoes
 nor fleas nor excessive activity of brain.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII
 </h2>
 <p>
 When Chichikov awoke he stretched himself and realised that he had slept
 well. For a moment or two he lay on his back, and then suddenly clapped
 his hands at the recollection that he was now owner of nearly four hundred
 souls. At once he leapt out of bed without so much as glancing at his face
 in the mirror, though, as a rule, he had much solicitude for his features,
 and especially for his chin, of which he would make the most when in
 company with friends, and more particularly should any one happen to enter
 while he was engaged in the process of shaving. "Look how round my chin
 is!" was his usual formula. On the present occasion, however, he looked
 neither at chin nor at any other feature, but at once donned his
 flower-embroidered slippers of morroco leather (the kind of slippers in
 which, thanks to the Russian love for a dressing-gowned existence, the
 town of Torzhok does such a huge trade), and, clad only in a meagre shirt,
 so far forgot his elderliness and dignity as to cut a couple of capers
 after the fashion of a Scottish highlander?alighting neatly, each
 time, on the flat of his heels. Only when he had done that did he proceed
 to business. Planting himself before his dispatch-box, he rubbed his hands
 with a satisfaction worthy of an incorruptible rural magistrate when
 adjourning for luncheon; after which he extracted from the receptacle a
 bundle of papers. These he had decided not to deposit with a lawyer, for
 the reason that he would hasten matters, as well as save expense, by
 himself framing and fair-copying the necessary deeds of indenture; and
 since he was thoroughly acquainted with the necessary terminology, he
 proceeded to inscribe in large characters the date, and then in smaller
 ones, his name and rank. By two o'clock the whole was finished, and as he
 looked at the sheets of names representing bygone peasants who had
 ploughed, worked at handicrafts, cheated their masters, fetched, carried,
 and got drunk (though SOME of them may have behaved well), there came over
 him a strange, unaccountable sensation. To his eye each list of names
 seemed to possess a character of its own; and even individual peasants
 therein seemed to have taken on certain qualities peculiar to themselves.
 For instance, to the majority of Madame Korobotchka's serfs there were
 appended nicknames and other additions; Plushkin's list was distinguished
 by a conciseness of exposition which had led to certain of the items being
 represented merely by Christian name, patronymic, and a couple of dots;
 and Sobakevitch's list was remarkable for its amplitude and
 circumstantiality, in that not a single peasant had such of his peculiar
 characteristics omitted as that the deceased had been "excellent at
 joinery," or "sober and ready to pay attention to his work." Also, in
 Sobakevitch's list there was recorded who had been the father and the
 mother of each of the deceased, and how those parents had behaved
 themselves. Only against the name of a certain Thedotov was there
 inscribed: "Father unknown, Mother the maidservant Kapitolina, Morals and
 Honesty good." These details communicated to the document a certain air of
 freshness, they seemed to connote that the peasants in question had lived
 but yesterday. As Chichikov scanned the list he felt softened in spirit,
 and said with a sigh:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My friends, what a concourse of you is here! How did you all pass your
 lives, my brethren? And how did you all come to depart hence?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he spoke his eyes halted at one name in particular?that of the
 same Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito who had once been the property of the
 window Korobotchka. Once more he could not help exclaiming:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a series of titles! They occupy a whole line! Peter Saveliev, I
 wonder whether you were an artisan or a plain muzhik. Also, I wonder how
 you came to meet your end; whether in a tavern, or whether through going
 to sleep in the middle of the road and being run over by a train of
 waggons. Again, I see the name, 'Probka Stepan, carpenter, very sober.'
 That must be the hero of whom the Guards would have been so glad to get
 hold. How well I can imagine him tramping the country with an axe in his
 belt and his boots on his shoulder, and living on a few groats'-worth of
 bread and dried fish per day, and taking home a couple of half-rouble
 pieces in his purse, and sewing the notes into his breeches, or stuffing
 them into his boots! In what manner came you by your end, Probka Stepan?
 Did you, for good wages, mount a scaffold around the cupola of the village
 church, and, climbing thence to the cross above, miss your footing on a
 beam, and fall headlong with none at hand but Uncle Michai?the good
 uncle who, scratching the back of his neck, and muttering, 'Ah, Vania, for
 once you have been too clever!' straightway lashed himself to a rope, and
 took your place? 'Maksim Teliatnikov, shoemaker.' A shoemaker, indeed? 'As
 drunk as a shoemaker,' says the proverb. <i>I</i> know what you were like,
 my friend. If you wish, I will tell you your whole history. You were
 apprenticed to a German, who fed you and your fellows at a common table,
 thrashed you with a strap, kept you indoors whenever you had made a
 mistake, and spoke of you in uncomplimentary terms to his wife and
 friends. At length, when your apprenticeship was over, you said to
 yourself, 'I am going to set up on my own account, and not just to scrape
 together a kopeck here and a kopeck there, as the Germans do, but to grow
 rich quick.' Hence you took a shop at a high rent, bespoke a few orders,
 and set to work to buy up some rotten leather out of which you could make,
 on each pair of boots, a double profit. But those boots split within a
 fortnight, and brought down upon your head dire showers of maledictions;
 with the result that gradually your shop grew empty of customers, and you
 fell to roaming the streets and exclaiming, 'The world is a very poor
 place indeed! A Russian cannot make a living for German competition.'
 Well, well! 'Elizabeta Vorobei!' But that is a WOMAN'S name! How comes SHE
 to be on the list? That villain Sobakevitch must have sneaked her in
 without my knowing it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Grigori Goiezhai-ne-Doiedesh,'" he went on. "What sort of a man were
 YOU, I wonder? Were you a carrier who, having set up a team of three
 horses and a tilt waggon, left your home, your native hovel, for ever, and
 departed to cart merchandise to market? Was it on the highway that you
 surrendered your soul to God, or did your friends first marry you to some
 fat, red-faced soldier's daughter; after which your harness and team of
 rough, but sturdy, horses caught a highwayman's fancy, and you, lying on
 your pallet, thought things over until, willy-nilly, you felt that you
 must get up and make for the tavern, thereafter blundering into an
 icehole? Ah, our peasant of Russia! Never do you welcome death when it
 comes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you, my friends?" continued Chichikov, turning to the sheet whereon
 were inscribed the names of Plushkin's absconded serfs. "Although you are
 still alive, what is the good of you? You are practically dead. Whither, I
 wonder, have your fugitive feet carried you? Did you fare hardly at
 Plushkin's, or was it that your natural inclinations led you to prefer
 roaming the wilds and plundering travellers? Are you, by this time, in
 gaol, or have you taken service with other masters for the tillage of
 their lands? 'Eremei Kariakin, Nikita Volokita and Anton Volokita (son of
 the foregoing).' To judge from your surnames, you would seem to have been
 born gadabouts <small>29</small>. 'Popov, household serf.'
 Probably you are an educated man, good Popov, and go in for polite
 thieving, as distinguished from the more vulgar cut-throat sort. In my
 mind's eye I seem to see a Captain of Rural Police challenging you for
 being without a passport; whereupon you stake your all upon a single
 throw. 'To whom do you belong?' asks the Captain, probably adding to his
 question a forcible expletive. 'To such and such a landowner,' stoutly you
 reply. 'And what are you doing here?' continues the Captain. 'I have just
 received permission to go and earn my obrok,' is your fluent explanation.
 'Then where is your passport?' 'At Miestchanin <small>30</small>
 Pimenov's.' 'Pimenov's? Then are you Pimenov himself?' 'Yes, I am Pimenov
 himself.' 'He has given you his passport?' 'No, he has not given me his
 passport.' 'Come, come!' shouts the Captain with another forcible
 expletive. 'You are lying!' 'No, I am not,' is your dogged reply. 'It is
 only that last night I could not return him his passport, because I came
 home late; so I handed it to Antip Prochorov, the bell-ringer, for him to
 take care of.' 'Bell-ringer, indeed! Then HE gave you a passport?' 'No; I
 did not receive a passport from him either.' 'What?'?and here the
 Captain shouts another expletive?'How dare you keep on lying? Where
 is YOUR OWN passport?' 'I had one all right,' you reply cunningly, 'but
 must have dropped it somewhere on the road as I came along.' 'And what
 about that soldier's coat?' asks the Captain with an impolite addition.
 'Whence did you get it? And what of the priest's cashbox and copper
 money?'' 'About them I know nothing,' you reply doggedly. 'Never at any
 time have I committed a theft.' 'Then how is it that the coat was found at
 your place?' 'I do not know. Probably some one else put it there.' 'You
 rascal, you rascal!' shouts the Captain, shaking his head, and closing in
 upon you. 'Put the leg-irons upon him, and off with him to prison!' 'With
 pleasure,' you reply as, taking a snuff-box from your pocket, you offer a
 pinch to each of the two gendarmes who are manacling you, while also
 inquiring how long they have been discharged from the army, and in what
 wars they may have served. And in prison you remain until your case comes
 on, when the justice orders you to be removed from Tsarev-Kokshaika to
 such and such another prison, and a second justice orders you to be
 transferred thence to Vesiegonsk or somewhere else, and you go flitting
 from gaol to gaol, and saying each time, as you eye your new habitation,
 'The last place was a good deal cleaner than this one is, and one could
 play babki <small>31</small>
 there, and stretch one's legs, and see a little society.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Abakum Thirov,'" Chichikov went on after a pause. "What of YOU, brother?
 Where, and in what capacity, are YOU disporting yourself? Have you gone to
 the Volga country, and become bitten with the life of freedom, and joined
 the fishermen of the river?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here, breaking off, Chichikov relapsed into silent meditation. Of what was
 he thinking as he sat there? Was he thinking of the fortunes of Abakum
 Thirov, or was he meditating as meditates every Russian when his thoughts
 once turn to the joys of an emancipated existence?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, well!" he sighed, looking at his watch. "It has now gone twelve
 o'clock. Why have I so forgotten myself? There is still much to be done,
 yet I go shutting myself up and letting my thoughts wander! What a fool I
 am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So saying, he exchanged his Scottish costume (of a shirt and nothing else)
 for attire of a more European nature; after which he pulled tight the
 waistcoat over his ample stomach, sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne,
 tucked his papers under his arm, took his fur cap, and set out for the
 municipal offices, for the purpose of completing the transfer of souls.
 The fact that he hurried along was not due to a fear of being late (seeing
 that the President of the Local Council was an intimate acquaintance of
 his, as well as a functionary who could shorten or prolong an interview at
 will, even as Homer's Zeus was able to shorten or to prolong a night or a
 day, whenever it became necessary to put an end to the fighting of his
 favourite heroes, or to enable them to join battle), but rather to a
 feeling that he would like to have the affair concluded as quickly as
 possible, seeing that, throughout, it had been an anxious and difficult
 business. Also, he could not get rid of the idea that his souls were
 unsubstantial things, and that therefore, under the circumstances, his
 shoulders had better be relieved of their load with the least possible
 delay. Pulling on his cinnamon-coloured, bear-lined overcoat as he went,
 he had just stepped thoughtfully into the street when he collided with a
 gentleman dressed in a similar coat and an ear-lappeted fur cap. Upon that
 the gentleman uttered an exclamation. Behold, it was Manilov! At once the
 friends became folded in a strenuous embrace, and remained so locked for
 fully five minutes. Indeed, the kisses exchanged were so vigorous that
 both suffered from toothache for the greater portion of the day. Also,
 Manilov's delight was such that only his nose and lips remained visible?the
 eyes completely disappeared. Afterwards he spent about a quarter of an
 hour in holding Chichikov's hand and chafing it vigorously. Lastly, he, in
 the most pleasant and exquisite terms possible, intimated to his friend
 that he had just been on his way to embrace Paul Ivanovitch; and upon this
 followed a compliment of the kind which would more fittingly have been
 addressed to a lady who was being asked to accord a partner the favour of
 a dance. Chichikov had opened his mouth to reply?though even HE felt
 at a loss how to acknowledge what had just been said?when Manilov
 cut him short by producing from under his coat a roll of paper tied with
 red riband.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What have you there?" asked Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The list of my souls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" And as Chichikov unrolled the document and ran his eye over it he
 could not but marvel at the elegant neatness with which it had been
 inscribed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is a beautiful piece of writing," he said. "In fact, there will be no
 need to make a copy of it. Also, it has a border around its edge! Who
 worked that exquisite border?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do not ask me," said Manilov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did YOU do it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; my wife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear, dear!" Chichikov cried. "To think that I should have put her to so
 much trouble!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "NOTHING could be too much trouble where Paul Ivanovitch is concerned."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov bowed his acknowledgements. Next, on learning that he was on his
 way to the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the transfer,
 Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him; wherefore the pair
 linked arm in arm and proceeded together. Whenever they encountered a
 slight rise in the ground?even the smallest unevenness or difference
 of level?Manilov supported Chichikov with such energy as almost to
 lift him off his feet, while accompanying the service with a smiling
 implication that not if HE could help it should Paul Ivanovitch slip or
 fall. Nevertheless this conduct appeared to embarrass Chichikov, either
 because he could not find any fitting words of gratitude or because he
 considered the proceeding tiresome; and it was with a sense of relief that
 he debouched upon the square where the municipal offices?a large,
 three-storied building of a chalky whiteness which probably symbolised the
 purity of the souls engaged within?were situated. No other building
 in the square could vie with them in size, seeing that the remaining
 edifices consisted only of a sentry-box, a shelter for two or three
 cabmen, and a long hoarding?the latter adorned with the usual bills,
 posters, and scrawls in chalk and charcoal. At intervals, from the windows
 of the second and third stories of the municipal offices, the
 incorruptible heads of certain of the attendant priests of Themis would
 peer quickly forth, and as quickly disappear again?probably for the
 reason that a superior official had just entered the room. Meanwhile the
 two friends ascended the staircase?nay, almost flew up it, since,
 longing to get rid of Manilov's ever-supporting arm, Chichikov hastened
 his steps, and Manilov kept darting forward to anticipate any possible
 failure on the part of his companion's legs. Consequently the pair were
 breathless when they reached the first corridor. In passing it may be
 remarked that neither corridors nor rooms evinced any of that cleanliness
 and purity which marked the exterior of the building, for such attributes
 were not troubled about within, and anything that was dirty remained so,
 and donned no meritricious, purely external, disguise. It was as though
 Themis received her visitors in neglige and a dressing-gown. The author
 would also give a description of the various offices through which our
 hero passed, were it not that he (the author) stands in awe of such legal
 haunts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Approaching the first desk which he happened to encounter, Chichikov
 inquired of the two young officials who were seated at it whether they
 would kindly tell him where business relating to serf-indenture was
 transacted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of what nature, precisely, IS your business?" countered one of the
 youthful officials as he turned himself round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I desire to make an application."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In connection with a purchase?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. But, as I say, I should like first to know where I can find the desk
 devoted to such business. Is it here or elsewhere?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must state what it is you have bought, and for how much. THEN we
 shall be happy to give you the information."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov perceived that the officials' motive was merely one of
 curiosity, as often happens when young tchinovniks desire to cut a more
 important and imposing figure than is rightfully theirs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, young sirs," he said. "I know for a fact that all serf
 business, no matter to what value, is transacted at one desk alone.
 Consequently I again request you to direct me to that desk. Of course, if
 you do not know your business I can easily ask some one else."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this the tchinovniks made no reply beyond pointing towards a corner of
 the room where an elderly man appeared to be engaged in sorting some
 papers. Accordingly Chichikov and Manilov threaded their way in his
 direction through the desks; whereupon the elderly man became violently
 busy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you mind telling me," said Chichikov, bowing, "whether this is the
 desk for serf affairs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elderly man raised his eyes, and said stiffly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is NOT the desk for serf affairs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is it, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the Serf Department."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And where might the Serf Department be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In charge of Ivan Antonovitch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And where is Ivan Antonovitch?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The elderly man pointed to another corner of the room; whither Chichikov
 and Manilov next directed their steps. As they advanced, Ivan Antonovitch
 cast an eye backwards and viewed them askance. Then, with renewed ardour,
 he resumed his work of writing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you mind telling me," said Chichikov, bowing, "whether this is the
 desk for serf affairs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It appeared as though Ivan Antonovitch had not heard, so completely did he
 bury himself in his papers and return no reply. Instantly it became plain
 that HE at least was of an age of discretion, and not one of your jejune
 chatterboxes and harum-scarums; for, although his hair was still thick and
 black, he had long ago passed his fortieth year. His whole face tended
 towards the nose?it was what, in common parlance, is known as a
 "pitcher-mug."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you mind telling me," repeated Chichikov, "whether this is the desk
 for serf affairs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is that," said Ivan Antonovitch, again lowering his jug-shaped jowl,
 and resuming his writing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I should like to transact the following business. From various
 landowners in this canton I have purchased a number of peasants for
 transfer. Here is the purchase list, and it needs but to be registered."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you also the vendors here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some of them, and from the rest I have obtained powers of attorney."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And have you your statement of application?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I desire?indeed, it is necessary for me so to do?to
 hasten matters a little. Could the affair, therefore, be carried through
 to-day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To-day? Oh, dear no!" said Ivan Antonovitch. "Before that can be done you
 must furnish me with further proofs that no impediments exist."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, to expedite matters, let me say that Ivan Grigorievitch, the
 President of the Council, is a very intimate friend of mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Possibly," said Ivan Antonovitch without enthusiasm. "But Ivan
 Grigorievitch alone will not do?it is customary to have others as
 well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but the absence of others will not altogether invalidate the
 transaction. I too have been in the service, and know how things can be
 done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You had better go and see Ivan Grigorievitch," said Ivan Antonovitch more
 mildly. "Should he give you an order addressed to whom it may concern, we
 shall soon be able to settle the matter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that Chichikov pulled from his pocket a paper, and laid it before
 Ivan Antonovitch. At once the latter covered it with a book. Chichikov
 again attempted to show it to him, but, with a movement of his head, Ivan
 Antonovitch signified that that was unnecessary.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A clerk," he added, "will now conduct you to Ivan Grigorievitch's room."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that one of the toilers in the service of Themis?a zealot who
 had offered her such heartfelt sacrifice that his coat had burst at the
 elbows and lacked a lining?escorted our friends (even as Virgil had
 once escorted Dante) to the apartment of the Presence. In this sanctum
 were some massive armchairs, a table laden with two or three fat books,
 and a large looking-glass. Lastly, in (apparently) sunlike isolation,
 there was seated at the table the President. On arriving at the door of
 the apartment, our modern Virgil seemed to have become so overwhelmed with
 awe that, without daring even to intrude a foot, he turned back, and, in
 so doing, once more exhibited a back as shiny as a mat, and having
 adhering to it, in one spot, a chicken's feather. As soon as the two
 friends had entered the hall of the Presence they perceived that the
 President was NOT alone, but, on the contrary, had seated by his side
 Sobakevitch, whose form had hitherto been concealed by the intervening
 mirror. The newcomers' entry evoked sundry exclamations and the pushing
 back of a pair of Government chairs as the voluminous-sleeved Sobakevitch
 rose into view from behind the looking-glass. Chichikov the President
 received with an embrace, and for a while the hall of the Presence
 resounded with osculatory salutations as mutually the pair inquired after
 one another's health. It seemed that both had lately had a touch of that
 pain under the waistband which comes of a sedentary life. Also, it seemed
 that the President had just been conversing with Sobakevitch on the
 subject of sales of souls, since he now proceeded to congratulate
 Chichikov on the same?a proceeding which rather embarrassed our
 hero, seeing that Manilov and Sobakevitch, two of the vendors, and persons
 with whom he had bargained in the strictest privacy, were now confronting
 one another direct. However, Chichikov duly thanked the President, and
 then, turning to Sobakevitch, inquired after HIS health.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank God, I have nothing to complain of," replied Sobakevitch: which was
 true enough, seeing that a piece of iron would have caught cold and taken
 to sneezing sooner than would that uncouthly fashioned landowner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, yes; you have always had good health, have you not?" put in the
 President. "Your late father was equally strong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, he even went out bear hunting alone," replied Sobakevitch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think that you too could worst a bear if you were to try a
 tussle with him," rejoined the President.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no," said Sobakevitch. "My father was a stronger man than I am." Then
 with a sigh the speaker added: "But nowadays there are no such men as he.
 What is even a life like mine worth?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you do not have a comfortable time of it?" exclaimed the President.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; far from it," rejoined Sobakevitch, shaking his head. "Judge for
 yourself, Ivan Grigorievitch. I am fifty years old, yet never in my life
 had been ill, except for an occasional carbuncle or boil. That is not a
 good sign. Sooner or later I shall have to pay for it." And he relapsed
 into melancholy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just listen to the fellow!" was Chichikov's and the President's joint
 inward comment. "What on earth has HE to complain of?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have a letter for you, Ivan Grigorievitch," went on Chichikov aloud as
 he produced from his pocket Plushkin's epistle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "From whom?" inquired the President. Having broken the seal, he exclaimed:
 "Why, it is from Plushkin! To think that HE is still alive! What a strange
 world it is! He used to be such a nice fellow, and now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now he is a cur," concluded Sobakevitch, "as well as a miser who
 starves his serfs to death."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Allow me a moment," said the President. Then he read the letter through.
 When he had finished he added: "Yes, I am quite ready to act as Plushkin's
 attorney. When do you wish the purchase deeds to be registered, Monsieur
 Chichikov?now or later?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, if you please," replied Chichikov. "Indeed, I beg that, if possible,
 the affair may be concluded to-day, since to-morrow I wish to leave the
 town. I have brought with me both the forms of indenture and my statement
 of application."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well. Nevertheless we cannot let you depart so soon. The indentures
 shall be completed to-day, but you must continue your sojourn in our
 midst. I will issue the necessary orders at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So saying, he opened the door into the general office, where the clerks
 looked like a swarm of bees around a honeycomb (if I may liken affairs of
 Government to such an article?).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Ivan Antonovitch here?" asked the President.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied a voice from within.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then send him here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon that the pitcher-faced Ivan Antonovitch made his appearance in the
 doorway, and bowed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take these indentures, Ivan Antonovitch," said the President, "and see
 that they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But first I would ask you to remember," put in Sobakevitch, "that
 witnesses ought to be in attendance?not less than two on behalf of
 either party. Let us, therefore, send for the Public Prosecutor, who has
 little to do, and has even that little done for him by his chief clerk,
 Zolotucha. The Inspector of the Medical Department is also a man of
 leisure, and likely to be at home?if he has not gone out to a card
 party. Others also there are?all men who cumber the ground for
 nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so, quite so," agreed the President, and at once dispatched a clerk
 to fetch the persons named.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Also," requested Chichikov, "I should be glad if you would send for the
 accredited representative of a certain lady landowner with whom I have
 done business. He is the son of a Father Cyril, and a clerk in your
 offices."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly we shall call him here," replied the President. "Everything
 shall be done to meet your convenience, and I forbid you to present any of
 our officials with a gratuity. That is a special request on my part. No
 friend of mine ever pays a copper."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that he gave Ivan Antonovitch the necessary instructions; and though
 they scarcely seemed to meet with that functionary's approval, upon the
 President the purchase deeds had evidently produced an excellent
 impression, more especially since the moment when he had perceived the sum
 total to amount to nearly a hundred thousand roubles. For a moment or two
 he gazed into Chichikov's eyes with an expression of profound
 satisfaction. Then he said:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well done, Paul Ivanovitch! You have indeed made a nice haul!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is so," replied Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Excellent business! Yes, excellent business!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I, too, conceive that I could not well have done better. The truth is
 that never until a man has driven home the piles of his life's structure
 upon a lasting bottom, instead of upon the wayward chimeras of youth, will
 his aims in life assume a definite end." And, that said, Chichikov went on
 to deliver himself of a very telling indictment of Liberalism and our
 modern young men. Yet in his words there seemed to lurk a certain lack of
 conviction. Somehow he seemed secretly to be saying to himself, "My good
 sir, you are talking the most absolute rubbish, and nothing but rubbish."
 Nor did he even throw a glance at Sobakevitch and Manilov. It was as
 though he were uncertain what he might not encounter in their expression.
 Yet he need not have been afraid. Never once did Sobakevitch's face move a
 muscle, and, as for Manilov, he was too much under the spell of
 Chichikov's eloquence to do aught beyond nod his approval at intervals,
 and strike the kind of attitude which is assumed by lovers of music when a
 lady singer has, in rivalry of an accompanying violin, produced a note
 whereof the shrillness would exceed even the capacity of a bird's
 throstle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why not tell Ivan Grigorievitch precisely what you have bought?"
 inquired Sobakevitch of Chichikov. "And why, Ivan Grigorievitch, do YOU
 not ask Monsieur Chichikov precisely what his purchases have consisted of?
 What a splendid lot of serfs, to be sure! I myself have sold him my
 wheelwright, Michiev."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? You have sold him Michiev?" exclaimed the President. "I know the
 man well. He is a splendid craftsman, and, on one occasion, made me a
 drozhki <small>32</small>.
 Only, only?well, lately didn't you tell me that he is dead?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That Michiev is dead?" re-echoed Sobakevitch, coming perilously near to
 laughing. "Oh dear no! That was his brother. Michiev himself is very much
 alive, and in even better health than he used to be. Any day he could
 knock you up a britchka such as you could not procure even in Moscow.
 However, he is now bound to work for only one master."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed a splendid craftsman!" repeated the President. "My only wonder is
 that you can have brought yourself to part with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then think you that Michiev is the ONLY serf with whom I have parted?
 Nay, for I have parted also with Probka Stepan, my carpenter, with
 Milushkin, my bricklayer, and with Teliatnikov, my bootmaker. Yes, the
 whole lot I have sold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And to the President's inquiry why he had so acted, seeing that the serfs
 named were all skilled workers and indispensable to a household,
 Sobakevitch replied that a mere whim had led him to do so, and thus the
 sale had owed its origin to a piece of folly. Then he hung his head as
 though already repenting of his rash act, and added:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Although a man of grey hairs, I have not yet learned wisdom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But," inquired the President further, "how comes it about, Paul
 Ivanovitch, that you have purchased peasants apart from land? Is it for
 transferment elsewhere that you need them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, then. That is quite another matter. To what province of the
 country?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the province of Kherson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? That region contains some splendid land," said the President;
 whereupon he proceeded to expatiate on the fertility of the Kherson
 pastures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And have you MUCH land there?" he continued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; quite sufficient to accommodate the serfs whom I have purchased."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And is there a river on the estate or a lake?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Both."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After this reply Chichikov involuntarily threw a glance at Sobakevitch;
 and though that landowner's face was as motionless as every other, the
 other seemed to detect in it: "You liar! Don't tell ME that you own both a
 river and a lake, as well as the land which you say you do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst the foregoing conversation had been in progress, various witnesses
 had been arriving on the scene. They consisted of the constantly blinking
 Public Prosecutor, the Inspector of the Medical Department, and others?all,
 to quote Sobakevitch, "men who cumbered the ground for nothing." With some
 of them, however, Chichikov was altogether unacquainted, since certain
 substitutes and supernumeraries had to be pressed into the service from
 among the ranks of the subordinate staff. There also arrived, in answer to
 the summons, not only the son of Father Cyril before mentioned, but also
 Father Cyril himself. Each such witness appended to his signature a full
 list of his dignities and qualifications: one man in printed characters,
 another in a flowing hand, a third in topsy-turvy characters of a kind
 never before seen in the Russian alphabet, and so forth. Meanwhile our
 friend Ivan Antonovitch comported himself with not a little address; and
 after the indentures had been signed, docketed, and registered, Chichikov
 found himself called upon to pay only the merest trifle in the way of
 Government percentage and fees for publishing the transaction in the
 Official Gazette. The reason of this was that the President had given
 orders that only half the usual charges were to be exacted from the
 present purchaser?the remaining half being somehow debited to the
 account of another applicant for serf registration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now," said Ivan Grigorievitch when all was completed, "we need only
 to wet the bargain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For that too I am ready," said Chichikov. "Do you but name the hour. If,
 in return for your most agreeable company, I were not to set a few
 champagne corks flying, I should be indeed in default."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But we are not going to let you charge yourself with anything whatsoever.
 WE must provide the champagne, for you are our guest, and it is for us?it
 is our duty, it is our bounden obligation?to entertain you. Look
 here, gentlemen. Let us adjourn to the house of the Chief of Police. He is
 the magician who needs but to wink when passing a fishmonger's or a wine
 merchant's. Not only shall we fare well at his place, but also we shall
 get a game of whist."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this proposal no one had any objection to offer, for the mere mention
 of the fish shop aroused the witnesses' appetite. Consequently, the
 ceremony being over, there was a general reaching for hats and caps. As
 the party were passing through the general office, Ivan Antonovitch
 whispered in Chichikov's ear, with a courteous inclination of his
 jug-shaped physiognomy:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have given a hundred thousand roubles for the serfs, but have paid ME
 only a trifle for my trouble."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Chichikov with a similar whisper, "but what sort of serfs
 do you suppose them to be? They are a poor, useless lot, and not worth
 even half the purchase money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This gave Ivan Antonovitch to understand that the visitor was a man of
 strong character?a man from whom nothing more was to be expected.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why have you gone and purchased souls from Plushkin?" whispered
 Sobakevitch in Chichikov's other ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did YOU go and add the woman Vorobei to your list?" retorted
 Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Vorobei? Who is Vorobei?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The woman 'Elizabet' Vorobei?'Elizabet,' not 'Elizabeta?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I added no such name," replied Sobakevitch, and straightway joined the
 other guests.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length the party arrived at the residence of the Chief of Police. The
 latter proved indeed a man of spells, for no sooner had he learnt what was
 afoot than he summoned a brisk young constable, whispered in his ear,
 adding laconically, "You understand, do you not?" and brought it about
 that, during the time that the guests were cutting for partners at whist
 in an adjoining room, the dining-table became laden with sturgeon,
 caviare, salmon, herrings, cheese, smoked tongue, fresh roe, and a potted
 variety of the same?all procured from the local fish market, and
 reinforced with additions from the host's own kitchen. The fact was that
 the worthy Chief of Police filled the office of a sort of father and
 general benefactor to the town, and that he moved among the citizens as
 though they constituted part and parcel of his own family, and watched
 over their shops and markets as though those establishments were merely
 his own private larder. Indeed, it would be difficult to say?so
 thoroughly did he perform his duties in this respect?whether the
 post most fitted him, or he the post. Matters were also so arranged that
 though his income more than doubled that of his predecessors, he had never
 lost the affection of his fellow townsmen. In particular did the tradesmen
 love him, since he was never above standing godfather to their children or
 dining at their tables. True, he had differences of opinion with them, and
 serious differences at that; but always these were skilfully adjusted by
 his slapping the offended ones jovially on the shoulder, drinking a glass
 of tea with them, promising to call at their houses and play a game of
 chess, asking after their belongings, and, should he learn that a child of
 theirs was ill, prescribing the proper medicine. In short, he bore the
 reputation of being a very good fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On perceiving the feast to be ready, the host proposed that his guests
 should finish their whist after luncheon; whereupon all proceeded to the
 room whence for some time past an agreeable odour had been tickling the
 nostrils of those present, and towards the door of which Sobakevitch in
 particular had been glancing since the moment when he had caught sight of
 a huge sturgeon reposing on the sideboard. After a glassful of warm,
 olive-coloured vodka apiece?vodka of the tint to be seen only in the
 species of Siberian stone whereof seals are cut?the company applied
 themselves to knife-and-fork work, and, in so doing, evinced their several
 characteristics and tastes. For instance, Sobakevitch, disdaining lesser
 trifles, tackled the large sturgeon, and, during the time that his fellow
 guests were eating minor comestibles, and drinking and talking, contrived
 to consume more than a quarter of the whole fish; so that, on the host
 remembering the creature, and, with fork in hand, leading the way in its
 direction and saying, "What, gentlemen, think you of this striking product
 of nature?" there ensued the discovery that of the said product of nature
 there remained little beyond the tail, while Sobakevitch, with an air as
 though at least HE had not eaten it, was engaged in plunging his fork into
 a much more diminutive piece of fish which happened to be resting on an
 adjacent platter. After his divorce from the sturgeon, Sobakevitch ate and
 drank no more, but sat frowning and blinking in an armchair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Apparently the host was not a man who believed in sparing the wine, for
 the toasts drunk were innumerable. The first toast (as the reader may
 guess) was quaffed to the health of the new landowner of Kherson; the
 second to the prosperity of his peasants and their safe transferment; and
 the third to the beauty of his future wife?a compliment which
 brought to our hero's lips a flickering smile. Lastly, he received from
 the company a pressing, as well as an unanimous, invitation to extend his
 stay in town for at least another fortnight, and, in the meanwhile, to
 allow a wife to be found for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Quite so," agreed the President. "Fight us tooth and nail though you may,
 we intend to have you married. You have happened upon us by chance, and
 you shall have no reason to repent of it. We are in earnest on this
 subject."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But why should I fight you tooth and nail?" said Chichikov, smiling.
 "Marriage would not come amiss to me, were I but provided with a
 betrothed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then a betrothed you shall have. Why not? We will do as you wish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," assented Chichikov.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bravo, bravo!" the company shouted. "Long live Paul Ivanovitch! Hurrah!
 Hurrah!" And with that every one approached to clink glasses with him, and
 he readily accepted the compliment, and accepted it many times in
 succession. Indeed, as the hours passed on, the hilarity of the company
 increased yet further, and more than once the President (a man of great
 urbanity when thoroughly in his cups) embraced the chief guest of the day
 with the heartfelt words, "My dearest fellow! My own most precious of
 friends!" Nay, he even started to crack his fingers, to dance around
 Chichikov's chair, and to sing snatches of a popular song. To the
 champagne succeeded Hungarian wine, which had the effect of still further
 heartening and enlivening the company. By this time every one had
 forgotten about whist, and given himself up to shouting and disputing.
 Every conceivable subject was discussed, including politics and military
 affairs; and in this connection guests voiced jejune opinions for the
 expression of which they would, at any other time, have soundly spanked
 their offspring. Chichikov, like the rest, had never before felt so gay,
 and, imagining himself really and truly to be a landowner of Kherson,
 spoke of various improvements in agriculture, of the three-field system of
 tillage <small>33</small>,
 and of the beatific felicity of a union between two kindred souls. Also,
 he started to recite poetry to Sobakevitch, who blinked as he listened,
 for he greatly desired to go to sleep. At length the guest of the evening
 realised that matters had gone far enough, so begged to be given a lift
 home, and was accommodated with the Public Prosecutor's drozhki. Luckily
 the driver of the vehicle was a practised man at his work, for, while
 driving with one hand, he succeeded in leaning backwards and, with the
 other, holding Chichikov securely in his place. Arrived at the inn, our
 hero continued babbling awhile about a flaxen-haired damsel with rosy lips
 and a dimple in her right cheek, about villages of his in Kherson, and
 about the amount of his capital. Nay, he even issued seignorial
 instructions that Selifan should go and muster the peasants about to be
 transferred, and make a complete and detailed inventory of them. For a
 while Selifan listened in silence; then he left the room, and instructed
 Petrushka to help the barin to undress. As it happened, Chichikov's boots
 had no sooner been removed than he managed to perform the rest of his
 toilet without assistance, to roll on to the bed (which creaked terribly
 as he did so), and to sink into a sleep in every way worthy of a landowner
 of Kherson. Meanwhile Petrushka had taken his master's coat and trousers
 of bilberry-coloured check into the corridor; where, spreading them over a
 clothes' horse, he started to flick and to brush them, and to fill the
 whole corridor with dust. Just as he was about to replace them in his
 master's room he happened to glance over the railing of the gallery, and
 saw Selifan returning from the stable. Glances were exchanged, and in an
 instant the pair had arrived at an instinctive understanding?an
 understanding to the effect that the barin was sound asleep, and that
 therefore one might consider one's own pleasure a little. Accordingly
 Petrushka proceeded to restore the coat and trousers to their appointed
 places, and then descended the stairs; whereafter he and Selifan left the
 house together. Not a word passed between them as to the object of their
 expedition. On the contrary, they talked solely of extraneous subjects.
 Yet their walk did not take them far; it took them only to the other side
 of the street, and thence into an establishment which immediately
 confronted the inn. Entering a mean, dirty courtyard covered with glass,
 they passed thence into a cellar where a number of customers were seated
 around small wooden tables. What thereafter was done by Selifan and
 Petrushka God alone knows. At all events, within an hour's time they
 issued, arm in arm, and in profound silence, yet remaining markedly
 assiduous to one another, and ever ready to help one another around an
 awkward corner. Still linked together?never once releasing their
 mutual hold?they spent the next quarter of an hour in attempting to
 negotiate the stairs of the inn; but at length even that ascent had been
 mastered, and they proceeded further on their way. Halting before his mean
 little pallet, Petrushka stood awhile in thought. His difficulty was how
 best to assume a recumbent position. Eventually he lay down on his face,
 with his legs trailing over the floor; after which Selifan also stretched
 himself upon the pallet, with his head resting upon Petrushka's stomach,
 and his mind wholly oblivious of the fact that he ought not to have been
 sleeping there at all, but in the servant's quarters, or in the stable
 beside his horses. Scarcely a moment had passed before the pair were
 plunged in slumber and emitting the most raucous snores; to which their
 master (next door) responded with snores of a whistling and nasal order.
 Indeed, before long every one in the inn had followed their soothing
 example, and the hostelry lay plunged in complete restfulness. Only in the
 window of the room of the newly-arrived lieutenant from Riazan did a light
 remain burning. Evidently he was a devotee of boots, for he had purchased
 four pairs, and was now trying on a fifth. Several times he approached the
 bed with a view to taking off the boots and retiring to rest; but each
 time he failed, for the reason that the boots were so alluring in their
 make that he had no choice but to lift up first one foot, and then the
 other, for the purpose of scanning their elegant welts.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was not long before Chichikov's purchases had become the talk of the
 town; and various were the opinions expressed as to whether or not it was
 expedient to procure peasants for transferment. Indeed such was the
 interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the
 purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order to
 ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though
 Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared
 that he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he
 declared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the
 peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk, and
 that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they would
 undoubtedly prove in every way tractable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One particularly good result of this advertisement of his scheme was that
 he came to rank as neither more nor less than a millionaire. Consequently,
 much as the inhabitants had liked our hero in the first instance (as seen
 in Chapter I.), they now liked him more than ever. As a matter of fact,
 they were citizens of an exceptionally quiet, good-natured, easy-going
 disposition; and some of them were even well-educated. For instance, the
 President of the Local Council could recite the whole of Zhukovski's
 LUDMILLA by heart, and give such an impressive rendering of the passage
 "The pine forest was asleep and the valley at rest" (as well as of the
 exclamation "Phew!") that one felt, as he did so, that the pine forest and
 the valley really WERE as he described them. The effect was also further
 heightened by the manner in which, at such moments, he assumed the most
 portentous frown. For his part, the Postmaster went in more for
 philosophy, and diligently perused such works as Young's Night Thoughts,
 and Eckharthausen's A Key to the Mysteries of Nature; of which latter work
 he would make copious extracts, though no one had the slightest notion
 what they referred to. For the rest, he was a witty, florid little
 individual, and much addicted to a practice of what he called
 "embellishing" whatsoever he had to say?a feat which he performed
 with the aid of such by-the-way phrases as "my dear sir," "my good
 So-and-So," "you know," "you understand," "you may imagine," "relatively
 speaking," "for instance," and "et cetera"; of which phrases he would add
 sackfuls to his speech. He could also "embellish" his words by the simple
 expedient of half-closing, half-winking one eye; which trick communicated
 to some of his satirical utterances quite a mordant effect. Nor were his
 colleagues a wit inferior to him in enlightenment. For instance, one of
 them made a regular practice of reading Karamzin, another of conning the
 Moscow Gazette, and a third of never looking at a book at all. Likewise,
 although they were the sort of men to whom, in their more intimate
 movements, their wives would very naturally address such nicknames as
 "Toby Jug," "Marmot," "Fatty," "Pot Belly," "Smutty," "Kiki," and
 "Buzz-Buzz," they were men also of good heart, and very ready to extend
 their hospitality and their friendship when once a guest had eaten of
 their bread and salt, or spent an evening in their company. Particularly,
 therefore, did Chichikov earn these good folk's approval with his taking
 methods and qualities?so much so that the expression of that
 approval bid fair to make it difficult for him to quit the town, seeing
 that, wherever he went, the one phrase dinned into his ears was "Stay
 another week with us, Paul Ivanovitch." In short, he ceased to be a free
 agent. But incomparably more striking was the impression (a matter for
 unbounded surprise!) which he produced upon the ladies. Properly to
 explain this phenomenon I should need to say a great deal about the ladies
 themselves, and to describe in the most vivid of colours their social
 intercourse and spiritual qualities. Yet this would be a difficult thing
 for me to do, since, on the one hand, I should be hampered by my boundless
 respect for the womenfolk of all Civil Service officials, and, on the
 other hand?well, simply by the innate arduousness of the task. The
 ladies of N. were?But no, I cannot do it; my heart has already
 failed me. Come, come! The ladies of N. were distinguished for?But
 it is of no use; somehow my pen seems to refuse to move over the paper?it
 seems to be weighted as with a plummet of lead. Very well. That being so,
 I will merely say a word or two concerning the most prominent tints on the
 feminine palette of N.?merely a word or two concerning the outward
 appearance of its ladies, and a word or two concerning their more
 superficial characteristics. The ladies of N. were pre-eminently what is
 known as "presentable." Indeed, in that respect they might have served as
 a model to the ladies of many another town. That is to say, in whatever
 pertained to "tone," etiquette, the intricacies of decorum, and strict
 observance of the prevailing mode, they surpassed even the ladies of
 Moscow and St. Petersburg, seeing that they dressed with taste, drove
 about in carriages in the latest fashions, and never went out without the
 escort of a footman in gold-laced livery. Again, they looked upon a
 visiting card?even upon a make-shift affair consisting of an ace of
 diamonds or a two of clubs?as a sacred thing; so sacred that on one
 occasion two closely related ladies who had also been closely attached
 friends were known to fall out with one another over the mere fact of an
 omission to return a social call! Yes, in spite of the best efforts of
 husbands and kinsfolk to reconcile the antagonists, it became clear that,
 though all else in the world might conceivably be possible, never could
 the hatchet be buried between ladies who had quarrelled over a neglected
 visit. Likewise strenuous scenes used to take place over questions of
 precedence?scenes of a kind which had the effect of inspiring
 husbands to great and knightly ideas on the subject of protecting the
 fair. True, never did a duel actually take place, since all the husbands
 were officials belonging to the Civil Service; but at least a given
 combatant would strive to heap contumely upon his rival, and, as we all
 know, that is a resource which may prove even more effectual than a duel.
 As regards morality, the ladies of N. were nothing if not censorious, and
 would at once be fired with virtuous indignation when they heard of a case
 of vice or seduction. Nay, even to mere frailty they would award the lash
 without mercy. On the other hand, should any instance of what they called
 "third personism" occur among THEIR OWN circle, it was always kept dark?not
 a hint of what was going on being allowed to transpire, and even the
 wronged husband holding himself ready, should he meet with, or hear of,
 the "third person," to quote, in a mild and rational manner, the proverb,
 "Whom concerns it that a friend should consort with friend?" In addition,
 I may say that, like most of the female world of St. Petersburg, the
 ladies of N. were pre-eminently careful and refined in their choice of
 words and phrases. Never did a lady say, "I blew my nose," or "I
 perspired," or "I spat." No, it had to be, "I relieved my nose through the
 expedient of wiping it with my handkerchief," and so forth. Again, to say,
 "This glass, or this plate, smells badly," was forbidden. No, not even a
 hint to such an effect was to be dropped. Rather, the proper phrase, in
 such a case, was "This glass, or this plate, is not behaving very well,"?or
 some such formula.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In fact, to refine the Russian tongue the more thoroughly, something like
 half the words in it were cut out: which circumstance necessitated very
 frequent recourse to the tongue of France, since the same words, if spoken
 in French, were another matter altogether, and one could use even blunter
 ones than the ones originally objected to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So much for the ladies of N., provided that one confines one's
 observations to the surface; yet hardly need it be said that, should one
 penetrate deeper than that, a great deal more would come to light. At the
 same time, it is never a very safe proceeding to peer deeply into the
 hearts of ladies; wherefore, restricting ourselves to the foregoing
 superficialities, let us proceed further on our way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hitherto the ladies had paid Chichikov no particular attention, though
 giving him full credit for his gentlemanly and urbane demeanour; but from
 the moment that there arose rumours of his being a millionaire other
 qualities of his began to be canvassed. Nevertheless, not ALL the ladies
 were governed by interested motives, since it is due to the term
 "millionaire" rather than to the character of the person who bears it,
 that the mere sound of the word exercises upon rascals, upon decent folk,
 and upon folk who are neither the one nor the other, an undeniable
 influence. A millionaire suffers from the disadvantage of everywhere
 having to behold meanness, including the sort of meanness which, though
 not actually based upon calculations of self-interest, yet runs after the
 wealthy man with smiles, and doffs his hat, and begs for invitations to
 houses where the millionaire is known to be going to dine. That a similar
 inclination to meanness seized upon the ladies of N. goes without saying;
 with the result that many a drawing-room heard it whispered that, if
 Chichikov was not exactly a beauty, at least he was sufficiently
 good-looking to serve for a husband, though he could have borne to have
 been a little more rotund and stout. To that there would be added scornful
 references to lean husbands, and hints that they resembled tooth-brushes
 rather than men?with many other feminine additions. Also, such
 crowds of feminine shoppers began to repair to the Bazaar as almost to
 constitute a crush, and something like a procession of carriages ensued,
 so long grew the rank of vehicles. For their part, the tradesmen had the
 joy of seeing highly priced dress materials which they had brought at
 fairs, and then been unable to dispose of, now suddenly become tradeable,
 and go off with a rush. For instance, on one occasion a lady appeared at
 Mass in a bustle which filled the church to an extent which led the verger
 on duty to bid the commoner folk withdraw to the porch, lest the lady's
 toilet should be soiled in the crush. Even Chichikov could not help
 privately remarking the attention which he aroused. On one occasion, when
 he returned to the inn, he found on his table a note addressed to himself.
 Whence it had come, and who had delivered it, he failed to discover, for
 the waiter declared that the person who had brought it had omitted to
 leave the name of the writer. Beginning abruptly with the words "I MUST
 write to you," the letter went on to say that between a certain pair of
 souls there existed a bond of sympathy; and this verity the epistle
 further confirmed with rows of full stops to the extent of nearly half a
 page. Next there followed a few reflections of a correctitude so
 remarkable that I have no choice but to quote them. "What, I would ask, is
 this life of ours?" inquired the writer. "'Tis nought but a vale of woe.
 And what, I would ask, is the world? 'Tis nought but a mob of unthinking
 humanity." Thereafter, incidentally remarking that she had just dropped a
 tear to the memory of her dear mother, who had departed this life
 twenty-five years ago, the (presumably) lady writer invited Chichikov to
 come forth into the wilds, and to leave for ever the city where, penned in
 noisome haunts, folk could not even draw their breath. In conclusion, the
 writer gave way to unconcealed despair, and wound up with the following
 verses:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Two turtle doves to thee, one day,
 My dust will show, congealed in death;
 And, cooing wearily, they'll say:
 'In grief and loneliness she drew her closing breath.'"
</pre>
 <p>
 True, the last line did not scan, but that was a trifle, since the
 quatrain at least conformed to the mode then prevalent. Neither signature
 nor date were appended to the document, but only a postscript expressing a
 conjecture that Chichikov's own heart would tell him who the writer was,
 and stating, in addition, that the said writer would be present at the
 Governor's ball on the following night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This greatly interested Chichikov. Indeed, there was so much that was
 alluring and provocative of curiosity in the anonymous missive that he
 read it through a second time, and then a third, and finally said to
 himself: "I SHOULD like to know who sent it!" In short, he took the thing
 seriously, and spent over an hour in considering the same. At length,
 muttering a comment upon the epistle's efflorescent style, he refolded the
 document, and committed it to his dispatch-box in company with a play-bill
 and an invitation to a wedding?the latter of which had for the last
 seven years reposed in the self-same receptacle and in the self-same
 position. Shortly afterwards there arrived a card of invitation to the
 Governor's ball already referred to. In passing, it may be said that such
 festivities are not infrequent phenomena in county towns, for the reason
 that where Governors exist there must take place balls if from the local
 gentry there is to be evoked that respectful affection which is every
 Governor's due.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thenceforth all extraneous thoughts and considerations were laid aside in
 favour of preparing for the coming function. Indeed, this conjunction of
 exciting and provocative motives led to Chichikov devoting to his toilet
 an amount of time never witnessed since the creation of the world. Merely
 in the contemplation of his features in the mirror, as he tried to
 communicate to them a succession of varying expressions, was an hour
 spent. First of all he strove to make his features assume an air of
 dignity and importance, and then an air of humble, but faintly satirical,
 respect, and then an air of respect guiltless of any alloy whatsoever.
 Next, he practised performing a series of bows to his reflection,
 accompanied with certain murmurs intended to bear a resemblance to a
 French phrase (though Chichikov knew not a single word of the Gallic
 tongue). Lastly came the performing of a series of what I might call
 "agreeable surprises," in the shape of twitchings of the brow and lips and
 certain motions of the tongue. In short, he did all that a man is apt to
 do when he is not only alone, but also certain that he is handsome and
 that no one is regarding him through a chink. Finally he tapped himself
 lightly on the chin, and said, "Ah, good old face!" In the same way, when
 he started to dress himself for the ceremony, the level of his high
 spirits remained unimpaired throughout the process. That is to say, while
 adjusting his braces and tying his tie, he shuffled his feet in what was
 not exactly a dance, but might be called the entr'acte of a dance: which
 performance had the not very serious result of setting a wardrobe
 a-rattle, and causing a brush to slide from the table to the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later, his entry into the ballroom produced an extraordinary effect. Every
 one present came forward to meet him, some with cards in their hands, and
 one man even breaking off a conversation at the most interesting point?namely,
 the point that "the Inferior Land Court must be made responsible for
 everything." Yes, in spite of the responsibility of the Inferior Land
 Court, the speaker cast all thoughts of it to the winds as he hurried to
 greet our hero. From every side resounded acclamations of welcome, and
 Chichikov felt himself engulfed in a sea of embraces. Thus, scarcely had
 he extricated himself from the arms of the President of the Local Council
 when he found himself just as firmly clasped in the arms of the Chief of
 Police, who, in turn, surrendered him to the Inspector of the Medical
 Department, who, in turn, handed him over to the Commissioner of Taxes,
 who, again, committed him to the charge of the Town Architect. Even the
 Governor, who hitherto had been standing among his womenfolk with a box of
 sweets in one hand and a lap-dog in the other, now threw down both sweets
 and lap-dog (the lap-dog giving vent to a yelp as he did so) and added his
 greeting to those of the rest of the company. Indeed, not a face was there
 to be seen on which ecstatic delight?or, at all events, the
 reflection of other people's ecstatic delight?was not painted. The
 same expression may be discerned on the faces of subordinate officials
 when, the newly arrived Director having made his inspection, the said
 officials are beginning to get over their first sense of awe on perceiving
 that he has found much to commend, and that he can even go so far as to
 jest and utter a few words of smiling approval. Thereupon every tchinovnik
 responds with a smile of double strength, and those who (it may be) have
 not heard a single word of the Director's speech smile out of sympathy
 with the rest, and even the gendarme who is posted at the distant door?a
 man, perhaps, who has never before compassed a smile, but is more
 accustomed to dealing out blows to the populace?summons up a kind of
 grin, even though the grin resembles the grimace of a man who is about to
 sneeze after inadvertently taking an over-large pinch of snuff. To all and
 sundry Chichikov responded with a bow, and felt extraordinarily at his
 ease as he did so. To right and left did he incline his head in the
 sidelong, yet unconstrained, manner that was his wont and never failed to
 charm the beholder. As for the ladies, they clustered around him in a
 shining bevy that was redolent of every species of perfume?of roses,
 of spring violets, and of mignonette; so much so that instinctively
 Chichikov raised his nose to snuff the air. Likewise the ladies' dresses
 displayed an endless profusion of taste and variety; and though the
 majority of their wearers evinced a tendency to embonpoint, those wearers
 knew how to call upon art for the concealment of the fact. Confronting
 them, Chichikov thought to himself: "Which of these beauties is the writer
 of the letter?" Then again he snuffed the air. When the ladies had, to a
 certain extent, returned to their seats, he resumed his attempts to
 discern (from glances and expressions) which of them could possibly be the
 unknown authoress. Yet, though those glances and expressions were too
 subtle, too insufficiently open, the difficulty in no way diminished his
 high spirits. Easily and gracefully did he exchange agreeable bandinage
 with one lady, and then approach another one with the short, mincing steps
 usually affected by young-old dandies who are fluttering around the fair.
 As he turned, not without dexterity, to right and left, he kept one leg
 slightly dragging behind the other, like a short tail or comma. This trick
 the ladies particularly admired. In short, they not only discovered in him
 a host of recommendations and attractions, but also began to see in his
 face a sort of grand, Mars-like, military expression?a thing which,
 as we know, never fails to please the feminine eye. Certain of the ladies
 even took to bickering over him, and, on perceiving that he spent most of
 his time standing near the door, some of their number hastened to occupy
 chairs nearer to his post of vantage. In fact, when a certain dame chanced
 to have the good fortune to anticipate a hated rival in the race there
 very nearly ensued a most lamentable scene?which, to many of those
 who had been desirous of doing exactly the same thing, seemed a peculiarly
 horrible instance of brazen-faced audacity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So deeply did Chichikov become plunged in conversation with his fair
 pursuers?or rather, so deeply did those fair pursuers enmesh him in
 the toils of small talk (which they accomplished through the expedient of
 asking him endless subtle riddles which brought the sweat to his brow in
 his attempts to guess them)?that he forgot the claims of courtesy
 which required him first of all to greet his hostess. In fact, he
 remembered those claims only on hearing the Governor's wife herself
 addressing him. She had been standing before him for several minutes, and
 now greeted him with suave expressement and the words, "So HERE you are,
 Paul Ivanovitch!" But what she said next I am not in a position to report,
 for she spoke in the ultra-refined tone and vein wherein ladies and
 gentlemen customarily express themselves in high-class novels which have
 been written by experts more qualified than I am to describe salons, and
 able to boast of some acquaintance with good society. In effect, what the
 Governor's wife said was that she hoped?she greatly hoped?that
 Monsieur Chichikov's heart still contained a corner?even the
 smallest possible corner?for those whom he had so cruelly forgotten.
 Upon that Chichikov turned to her, and was on the point of returning a
 reply at least no worse than that which would have been returned, under
 similar circumstances, by the hero of a fashionable novelette, when he
 stopped short, as though thunderstruck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before him there was standing not only Madame, but also a young girl whom
 she was holding by the hand. The golden hair, the fine-drawn, delicate
 contours, the face with its bewitching oval?a face which might have
 served as a model for the countenance of the Madonna, since it was of a
 type rarely to be met with in Russia, where nearly everything, from plains
 to human feet, is, rather, on the gigantic scale; these features, I say,
 were those of the identical maiden whom Chichikov had encountered on the
 road when he had been fleeing from Nozdrev's. His emotion was such that he
 could not formulate a single intelligible syllable; he could merely murmur
 the devil only knows what, though certainly nothing of the kind which
 would have risen to the lips of the hero of a fashionable novel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think that you have not met my daughter before?" said Madame. "She is
 just fresh from school."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He replied that he HAD had the happiness of meeting Mademoiselle before,
 and under rather unexpected circumstances; but on his trying to say
 something further his tongue completely failed him. The Governor's wife
 added a word or two, and then carried off her daughter to speak to some of
 the other guests.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov stood rooted to the spot, like a man who, after issuing into the
 street for a pleasant walk, has suddenly come to a halt on remembering
 that something has been left behind him. In a moment, as he struggles to
 recall what that something is, the mien of careless expectancy disappears
 from his face, and he no longer sees a single person or a single object in
 his vicinity. In the same way did Chichikov suddenly become oblivious to
 the scene around him. Yet all the while the melodious tongues of ladies
 were plying him with multitudinous hints and questions?hints and
 questions inspired with a desire to captivate. "Might we poor cumberers of
 the ground make so bold as to ask you what you are thinking of?" "Pray
 tell us where lie the happy regions in which your thoughts are wandering?"
 "Might we be informed of the name of her who has plunged you into this
 sweet abandonment of meditation?"?such were the phrases thrown at
 him. But to everything he turned a dead ear, and the phrases in question
 might as well have been stones dropped into a pool. Indeed, his rudeness
 soon reached the pitch of his walking away altogether, in order that he
 might go and reconnoitre wither the Governor's wife and daughter had
 retreated. But the ladies were not going to let him off so easily. Every
 one of them had made up her mind to use upon him her every weapon, and to
 exhibit whatsoever might chance to constitute her best point. Yet the
 ladies' wiles proved useless, for Chichikov paid not the smallest
 attention to them, even when the dancing had begun, but kept raising
 himself on tiptoe to peer over people's heads and ascertain in which
 direction the bewitching maiden with the golden hair had gone. Also, when
 seated, he continued to peep between his neighbours' backs and shoulders,
 until at last he discovered her sitting beside her mother, who was wearing
 a sort of Oriental turban and feather. Upon that one would have thought
 that his purpose was to carry the position by storm; for, whether moved by
 the influence of spring, or whether moved by a push from behind, he
 pressed forward with such desperate resolution that his elbow caused the
 Commissioner of Taxes to stagger on his feet, and would have caused him to
 lose his balance altogether but for the supporting row of guests in the
 rear. Likewise the Postmaster was made to give ground; whereupon he turned
 and eyed Chichikov with mingled astonishment and subtle irony. But
 Chichikov never even noticed him; he saw in the distance only the
 golden-haired beauty. At that moment she was drawing on a long glove and,
 doubtless, pining to be flying over the dancing-floor, where, with
 clicking heels, four couples had now begun to thread the mazes of the
 mazurka. In particular was a military staff-captain working body and soul
 and arms and legs to compass such a series of steps as were never before
 performed, even in a dream. However, Chichikov slipped past the mazurka
 dancers, and, almost treading on their heels, made his way towards the
 spot where Madame and her daughter were seated. Yet he approached them
 with great diffidence and none of his late mincing and prancing. Nay, he
 even faltered as he walked; his every movement had about it an air of
 awkwardness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is difficult to say whether or not the feeling which had awakened in
 our hero's breast was the feeling of love; for it is problematical whether
 or not men who are neither stout nor thin are capable of any such
 sentiment. Nevertheless, something strange, something which he could not
 altogether explain, had come upon him. It seemed as though the ball, with
 its talk and its clatter, had suddenly become a thing remote?that
 the orchestra had withdrawn behind a hill, and the scene grown misty, like
 the carelessly painted-in background of a picture. And from that misty
 void there could be seen glimmering only the delicate outlines of the
 bewitching maiden. Somehow her exquisite shape reminded him of an ivory
 toy, in such fair, white, transparent relief did it stand out against the
 dull blur of the surrounding throng.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Herein we see a phenomenon not infrequently observed?the phenomenon
 of the Chichikovs of this world becoming temporarily poets. At all events,
 for a moment or two our Chichikov felt that he was a young man again, if
 not exactly a military officer. On perceiving an empty chair beside the
 mother and daughter, he hastened to occupy it, and though conversation at
 first hung fire, things gradually improved, and he acquired more
 confidence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this point I must reluctantly deviate to say that men of weight and
 high office are always a trifle ponderous when conversing with ladies.
 Young lieutenants?or, at all events, officers not above the rank of
 captain?are far more successful at the game. How they contrive to be
 so God only knows. Let them but make the most inane of remarks, and at
 once the maiden by their side will be rocking with laughter; whereas,
 should a State Councillor enter into conversation with a damsel, and
 remark that the Russian Empire is one of vast extent, or utter a
 compliment which he has elaborated not without a certain measure of
 intelligence (however strongly the said compliment may smack of a book),
 of a surety the thing will fall flat. Even a witticism from him will be
 laughed at far more by him himself than it will by the lady who may happen
 to be listening to his remarks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These comments I have interposed for the purpose of explaining to the
 reader why, as our hero conversed, the maiden began to yawn. Blind to
 this, however, he continued to relate to her sundry adventures which had
 befallen him in different parts of the world. Meanwhile (as need hardly be
 said) the rest of the ladies had taken umbrage at his behaviour. One of
 them purposely stalked past him to intimate to him the fact, as well as to
 jostle the Governor's daughter, and let the flying end of a scarf flick
 her face; while from a lady seated behind the pair came both a whiff of
 violets and a very venomous and sarcastic remark. Nevertheless, either he
 did not hear the remark or he PRETENDED not to hear it. This was unwise of
 him, since it never does to disregard ladies' opinions. Later-but too late?he
 was destined to learn this to his cost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In short, dissatisfaction began to display itself on every feminine face.
 No matter how high Chichikov might stand in society, and no matter how
 much he might be a millionaire and include in his expression of
 countenance an indefinable element of grandness and martial ardour, there
 are certain things which no lady will pardon, whosoever be the person
 concerned. We know that at Governor's balls it is customary for the
 onlookers to compose verses at the expense of the dancers; and in this
 case the verses were directed to Chichikov's address. Briefly, the
 prevailing dissatisfaction grew until a tacit edict of proscription had
 been issued against both him and the poor young maiden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But an even more unpleasant surprise was in store for our hero; for whilst
 the young lady was still yawning as Chichikov recounted to her certain of
 his past adventures and also touched lightly upon the subject of Greek
 philosophy, there appeared from an adjoining room the figure of Nozdrev.
 Whether he had come from the buffet, or whether he had issued from a
 little green retreat where a game more strenuous than whist had been in
 progress, or whether he had left the latter resort unaided, or whether he
 had been expelled therefrom, is unknown; but at all events when he entered
 the ballroom, he was in an elevated condition, and leading by the arm the
 Public Prosecutor, whom he seemed to have been dragging about for a long
 while past, seeing that the poor man was glancing from side to side as
 though seeking a means of putting an end to this personally conducted
 tour. Certainly he must have found the situation almost unbearable, in
 view of the fact that, after deriving inspiration from two glasses of tea
 not wholly undiluted with rum, Nozdrev was engaged in lying unmercifully.
 On sighting him in the distance, Chichikov at once decided to sacrifice
 himself. That is to say, he decided to vacate his present enviable
 position and make off with all possible speed, since he could see that an
 encounter with the newcomer would do him no good. Unfortunately at that
 moment the Governor buttonholed him with a request that he would come and
 act as arbiter between him (the Governor) and two ladies?the subject
 of dispute being the question as to whether or not woman's love is
 lasting. Simultaneously Nozdrev descried our hero and bore down upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, my fine landowner of Kherson!" he cried with a smile which set his
 fresh, spring-rose-pink cheeks a-quiver. "Have you been doing much trade
 in departed souls lately?" With that he turned to the Governor. "I suppose
 your Excellency knows that this man traffics in dead peasants?" he bawled.
 "Look here, Chichikov. I tell you in the most friendly way possible that
 every one here likes you?yes, including even the Governor.
 Nevertheless, had I my way, I would hang you! Yes, by God I would!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chichikov's discomfiture was complete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And, would you believe it, your Excellency," went on Nozdrev, "but this
 fellow actually said to me, 'Sell me your dead souls!' Why, I laughed till
 I nearly became as dead as the souls. And, behold, no sooner do I arrive
 here than I am told that he has bought three million roubles' worth of
 peasants for transferment! For transferment, indeed! And he wanted to
 bargain with me for my DEAD ones! Look here, Chichikov. You are a swine!
 Yes, by God, you are an utter swine! Is not that so, your Excellency? Is
 not that so, friend Prokurator <small>34</small>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But both his Excellency, the Public Prosecutor, and Chichikov were too
 taken aback to reply. The half-tipsy Nozdrev, without noticing them,
 continued his harangue as before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, my fine sir!" he cried. "THIS time I don't mean to let you go. No,
 not until I have learnt what all this purchasing of dead peasants means.
 Look here. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Yes, <i>I</i> say that?<i>I</i>
 who am one of your best friends." Here he turned to the Governor again.
 "Your Excellency," he continued, "you would never believe what
 inseperables this man and I have been. Indeed, if you had stood there and
 said to me, 'Nozdrev, tell me on your honour which of the two you love
 best?your father or Chichikov?' I should have replied, 'Chichikov,
 by God!'" With that he tackled our hero again, "Come, come, my friend!" he
 urged. "Let me imprint upon your cheeks a baiser or two. You will excuse
 me if I kiss him, will you not, your Excellency? No, do not resist me,
 Chichikov, but allow me to imprint at least one baiser upon your
 lily-white cheek." And in his efforts to force upon Chichikov what he
 termed his "baisers" he came near to measuring his length upon the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every one now edged away, and turned a deaf ear to his further babblings;
 but his words on the subject of the purchase of dead souls had none the
 less been uttered at the top of his voice, and been accompanied with such
 uproarious laughter that the curiosity even of those who had happened to
 be sitting or standing in the remoter corners of the room had been
 aroused. So strange and novel seemed the idea that the company stood with
 faces expressive of nothing but a dumb, dull wonder. Only some of the
 ladies (as Chichikov did not fail to remark) exchanged meaning,
 ill-natured winks and a series of sarcastic smiles: which circumstance
 still further increased his confusion. That Nozdrev was a notorious liar
 every one, of course, knew, and that he should have given vent to an
 idiotic outburst of this sort had surprised no one; but a dead soul?well,
 what was one to make of Nozdrev's reference to such a commodity?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Naturally this unseemly contretemps had greatly upset our hero; for,
 however foolish be a madman's words, they may yet prove sufficient to sow
 doubt in the minds of saner individuals. He felt much as does a man who,
 shod with well-polished boots, has just stepped into a dirty, stinking
 puddle. He tried to put away from him the occurrence, and to expand, and
 to enjoy himself once more. Nay, he even took a hand at whist. But all was
 of no avail?matters kept going as awry as a badly-bent hoop. Twice
 he blundered in his play, and the President of the Council was at a loss
 to understand how his friend, Paul Ivanovitch, lately so good and so
 circumspect a player, could perpetrate such a mauvais pas as to throw away
 a particular king of spades which the President has been "trusting" as (to
 quote his own expression) "he would have trusted God." At supper, too,
 matters felt uncomfortable, even though the society at Chichikov's table
 was exceedingly agreeable and Nozdrev had been removed, owing to the fact
 that the ladies had found his conduct too scandalous to be borne, now that
 the delinquent had taken to seating himself on the floor and plucking at
 the skirts of passing lady dancers. As I say, therefore, Chichikov found
 the situation not a little awkward, and eventually put an end to it by
 leaving the supper room before the meal was over, and long before the hour
 when usually he returned to the inn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In his little room, with its door of communication blocked with a
 wardrobe, his frame of mind remained as uncomfortable as the chair in
 which he was seated. His heart ached with a dull, unpleasant sensation,
 with a sort of oppressive emptiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The devil take those who first invented balls!" was his reflection. "Who
 derives any real pleasure from them? In this province there exist want and
 scarcity everywhere: yet folk go in for balls! How absurd, too, were those
 overdressed women! One of them must have had a thousand roubles on her
 back, and all acquired at the expense of the overtaxed peasant, or, worse
 still, at that of the conscience of her neighbour. Yes, we all know why
 bribes are accepted, and why men become crooked in soul. It is all done to
 provide wives?yes, may the pit swallow them up!?with fal-lals.
 And for what purpose? That some woman may not have to reproach her husband
 with the fact that, say, the Postmaster's wife is wearing a better dress
 than she is?a dress which has cost a thousand roubles! 'Balls and
 gaiety, balls and gaiety' is the constant cry. Yet what folly balls are!
 They do not consort with the Russian spirit and genius, and the devil only
 knows why we have them. A grown, middle-aged man?a man dressed in
 black, and looking as stiff as a poker?suddenly takes the floor and
 begins shuffling his feet about, while another man, even though conversing
 with a companion on important business, will, the while, keep capering to
 right and left like a billy-goat! Mimicry, sheer mimicry! The fact that
 the Frenchman is at forty precisely what he was at fifteen leads us to
 imagine that we too, forsooth, ought to be the same. No; a ball leaves one
 feeling that one has done a wrong thing?so much so that one does not
 care even to think of it. It also leaves one's head perfectly empty, even
 as does the exertion of talking to a man of the world. A man of that kind
 chatters away, and touches lightly upon every conceivable subject, and
 talks in smooth, fluent phrases which he has culled from books without
 grazing their substance; whereas go and have a chat with a tradesman who
 knows at least ONE thing thoroughly, and through the medium of experience,
 and see whether his conversation will not be worth more than the prattle
 of a thousand chatterboxes. For what good does one get out of balls?
 Suppose that a competent writer were to describe such a scene exactly as
 it stands? Why, even in a book it would seem senseless, even as it
 certainly is in life. Are, therefore, such functions right or wrong? One
 would answer that the devil alone knows, and then spit and close the
 book."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Such were the unfavourable comments which Chichikov passed upon balls in
 general. With it all, however, there went a second source of
 dissatisfaction. That is to say, his principal grudge was not so much
 against balls as against the fact that at this particular one he had been
 exposed, he had been made to disclose the circumstance that he had been
 playing a strange, an ambiguous part. Of course, when he reviewed the
 contretemps in the light of pure reason, he could not but see that it
 mattered nothing, and that a few rude words were of no account now that
 the chief point had been attained; yet man is an odd creature, and
 Chichikov actually felt pained by the could-shouldering administered to
 him by persons for whom he had not an atom of respect, and whose vanity
 and love of display he had only that moment been censuring. Still more, on
 viewing the matter clearly, he felt vexed to think that he himself had
 been so largely the cause of the catastrophe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet he was not angry with HIMSELF?of that you may be sure, seeing
 that all of us have a slight weakness for sparing our own faults, and
 always do our best to find some fellow-creature upon whom to vent our
 displeasure?whether that fellow-creature be a servant, a subordinate
 official, or a wife. In the same way Chichikov sought a scapegoat upon
 whose shoulders he could lay the blame for all that had annoyed him. He
 found one in Nozdrev, and you may be sure that the scapegoat in question
 received a good drubbing from every side, even as an experienced captain
 or chief of police will give a knavish starosta or postboy a rating not
 only in the terms become classical, but also in such terms as the said
 captain or chief of police may invent for himself. In short, Nozdrev's
 whole lineage was passed in review; and many of its members in the
 ascending line fared badly in the process.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile, at the other end of the town there was in progress an event
 which was destined to augment still further the unpleasantness of our
 hero's position. That is to say, through the outlying streets and alleys
 of the town there was clattering a vehicle to which it would be difficult
 precisely to assign a name, seeing that, though it was of a species
 peculiar to itself, it most nearly resembled a large, rickety water melon
 on wheels. Eventually this monstrosity drew up at the gates of a house
 where the archpriest of one of the churches resided, and from its doors
 there leapt a damsel clad in a jerkin and wearing a scarf over her head.
 For a while she thumped the gates so vigorously as to set all the dogs
 barking; then the gates stiffly opened, and admitted this unwieldy
 phenomenon of the road. Lastly, the barinia herself alighted, and stood
 revealed as Madame Korobotchka, widow of a Collegiate Secretary! The
 reason of her sudden arrival was that she had felt so uneasy about the
 possible outcome of Chichikov's whim, that during the three nights
 following his departure she had been unable to sleep a wink; whereafter,
 in spite of the fact that her horses were not shod, she had set off for
 the town, in order to learn at first hand how the dead souls were faring,
 and whether (which might God forfend!) she had not sold them at something
 like a third of their true value. The consequences of her venture the
 reader will learn from a conversation between two ladies. We will reserve
 it for the ensuing chapter.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IX
 </h2>
 <p>
 Next morning, before the usual hour for paying calls, there tripped from
 the portals of an orange-coloured wooden house with an attic storey and a
 row of blue pillars a lady in an elegant plaid cloak. With her came a
 footman in a many-caped greatcoat and a polished top hat with a gold band.
 Hastily, but gracefully, the lady ascended the steps let down from a
 koliaska which was standing before the entrance, and as soon as she had
 done so the footman shut her in, put up the steps again, and, catching
 hold of the strap behind the vehicle, shouted to the coachman, "Right
 away!" The reason of all this was that the lady was the possessor of a
 piece of intelligence that she was burning to communicate to a
 fellow-creature. Every moment she kept looking out of the carriage window,
 and perceiving, with almost speechless vexation, that, as yet, she was but
 half-way on her journey. The fronts of the houses appeared to her longer
 than usual, and in particular did the front of the white stone hospital,
 with its rows of narrow windows, seem interminable to a degree which at
 length forced her to ejaculate: "Oh, the cursed building! Positively there
 is no end to it!" Also, she twice adjured the coachman with the words, "Go
 quicker, Andrusha! You are a horribly long time over the journey this
 morning." But at length the goal was reached, and the koliaska stopped
 before a one-storied wooden mansion, dark grey in colour, and having white
 carvings over the windows, a tall wooden fence and narrow garden in front
 of the latter, and a few meagre trees looming white with an incongruous
 coating of road dust. In the windows of the building were also a few
 flower pots and a parrot that kept alternately dancing on the floor of its
 cage and hanging on to the ring of the same with its beak. Also, in the
 sunshine before the door two pet dogs were sleeping. Here there lived the
 lady's bosom friend. As soon as the bosom friend in question learnt of the
 newcomer's arrival, she ran down into the hall, and the two ladies kissed
 and embraced one another. Then they adjourned to the drawing-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How glad I am to see you!" said the bosom friend. "When I heard some one
 arriving I wondered who could possibly be calling so early. Parasha
 declared that it must be the Vice-Governor's wife, so, as I did not want
 to be bored with her, I gave orders that I was to be reported 'not at
 home.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For her part, the guest would have liked to have proceeded to business by
 communicating her tidings, but a sudden exclamation from the hostess
 imparted (temporarily) a new direction to the conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a pretty chintz!" she cried, gazing at the other's gown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it IS pretty," agreed the visitor. "On the other hand, Praskovia
 Thedorovna thinks that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In other words, the ladies proceeded to indulge in a conversation on the
 subject of dress; and only after this had lasted for a considerable while
 did the visitor let fall a remark which led her entertainer to inquire:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how is the universal charmer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My God!" replied the other. "There has been SUCH a business! In fact, do
 you know why I am here at all?" And the visitor's breathing became more
 hurried, and further words seemed to be hovering between her lips like
 hawks preparing to stoop upon their prey. Only a person of the unhumanity
 of a "true friend" would have had the heart to interrupt her; but the
 hostess was just such a friend, and at once interposed with:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder how any one can see anything in the man to praise or to admire.
 For my own part, I think?and I would say the same thing straight to
 his face?that he is a perfect rascal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but do listen to what I have got to tell you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I know that some people think him handsome," continued the hostess,
 unmoved; "but <i>I</i> say that he is nothing of the kind?that, in
 particular, his nose is perfectly odious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but let me finish what I was saying." The guest's tone was almost
 piteous in its appeal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You cannot imagine my state of mind! You see, this morning I received a
 visit from Father Cyril's wife?the Archpriest's wife?you know
 her, don't you? Well, whom do you suppose that fine gentleman visitor of
 ours has turned out to be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The man who has built the Archpriest a poultry-run?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh dear no! Had that been all, it would have been nothing. No. Listen to
 what Father Cyril's wife had to tell me. She said that, last night, a lady
 landowner named Madame Korobotchka arrived at the Archpriest's house?arrived
 all pale and trembling?and told her, oh, such things! They sound
 like a piece out of a book. That is to say, at dead of night, just when
 every one had retired to rest, there came the most dreadful knocking
 imaginable, and some one screamed out, 'Open the gates, or we will break
 them down!' Just think! After this, how any one can say that the man is
 charming I cannot imagine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, what of Madame Korobotchka? Is she a young woman or good looking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh dear no! Quite an old woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Splendid indeed! So he is actually engaged to a person like that? One may
 heartily commend the taste of our ladies for having fallen in love with
 him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevertheless, it is not as you suppose. Think, now! Armed with weapons
 from head to foot, he called upon this old woman, and said: 'Sell me any
 souls of yours which have lately died.' Of course, Madame Korobotchka
 answered, reasonably enough: 'I cannot sell you those souls, seeing that
 they have departed this world;' but he replied: 'No, no! They are NOT
 dead. 'Tis I who tell you that?I who ought to know the truth of the
 matter. I swear that they are still alive.' In short, he made such a scene
 that the whole village came running to the house, and children screamed,
 and men shouted, and no one could tell what it was all about. The affair
 seemed to me so horrible, so utterly horrible, that I trembled beyond
 belief as I listened to the story. 'My dearest madam,' said my maid,
 Mashka, 'pray look at yourself in the mirror, and see how white you are.'
 'But I have no time for that,' I replied, 'as I must be off to tell my
 friend, Anna Grigorievna, the news.' Nor did I lose a moment in ordering
 the koliaska. Yet when my coachman, Andrusha, asked me for directions I
 could not get a word out?I just stood staring at him like a fool,
 until I thought he must think me mad. Oh, Anna Grigorievna, if you but
 knew how upset I am!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What a strange affair!" commented the hostess. "What on earth can the man
 have meant by 'dead souls'? I confess that the words pass my
 understanding. Curiously enough, this is the second time I have heard
 speak of those souls. True, my husband avers that Nozdrev was lying; yet
 in his lies there seems to have been a grain of truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, just think of my state when I heard all this! 'And now,' apparently
 said Korobotchka to the Archpriest's wife, 'I am altogether at a loss what
 to do, for, throwing me fifteen roubles, the man forced me to sign a
 worthless paper?yes, me, an inexperienced, defenceless widow who
 knows nothing of business.' That such things should happen! TRY and
 imagine my feelings!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In my opinion, there is in this more than the dead souls which meet the
 eye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think so too," agreed the other. As a matter of fact, her friend's
 remark had struck her with complete surprise, as well as filled her with
 curiosity to know what the word "more" might possibly signify. In fact,
 she felt driven to inquire: "What do YOU suppose to be hidden beneath it
 all?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; tell me what YOU suppose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What <i>I</i> suppose? I am at a loss to conjecture."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, but tell me what is in your mind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon this the visitor had to confess herself nonplussed; for, though
 capable of growing hysterical, she was incapable of propounding any
 rational theory. Consequently she felt the more that she needed tender
 comfort and advice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then THIS is what I think about the dead souls," said the hostess.
 Instantly the guest pricked up her ears (or, rather, they pricked
 themselves up) and straightened herself and became, somehow, more modish,
 and, despite her not inconsiderable weight, posed herself to look like a
 piece of thistledown floating on the breeze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The dead souls," began the hostess.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are what, are what?" inquired the guest in great excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are, are?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me, tell me, for heaven's sake!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They are an invention to conceal something else. The man's real object
 is, is?TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So startling and unexpected was this conclusion that the guest sat reduced
 to a state of pale, petrified, genuine amazement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My God!" she cried, clapping her hands, "I should NEVER have guessed it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, to tell you the truth, I guessed it as soon as ever you opened your
 mouth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So much, then, for educating girls like the Governor's daughter at
 school! Just see what comes of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, indeed! And they tell me that she says things which I hesitate even
 to repeat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Truly it wrings one's heart to see to what lengths immorality has come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some of the men have quite lost their heads about her, but for my part I
 think her not worth noticing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course. And her manners are unbearable. But what puzzles me most is
 how a travelled man like Chichikov could come to let himself in for such
 an affair. Surely he must have accomplices?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Surely not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "CERTAINLY I should say so. Why, I have known him even try to sell his own
 father! At all events he staked him at cards."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? You interest me. I should never had thought him capable of such
 things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I always guessed him to be so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two ladies were still discussing the matter with acumen and success
 when there walked into the room the Public Prosecutor?bushy
 eyebrows, motionless features, blinking eyes, and all. At once the ladies
 hastened to inform him of the events related, adducing therewith full
 details both as to the purchase of dead souls and as to the scheme to
 abduct the Governor's daughter; after which they departed in different
 directions, for the purpose of raising the rest of the town. For the
 execution of this undertaking not more than half an hour was required. So
 thoroughly did they succeed in throwing dust in the public's eyes that for
 a while every one?more especially the army of public officials?was
 placed in the position of a schoolboy who, while still asleep, has had a
 bag of pepper thrown in his face by a party of more early-rising comrades.
 The questions now to be debated resolved themselves into two?namely,
 the question of the dead souls and the question of the Governor's
 daughter. To this end two parties were formed?the men's party and
 the feminine section. The men's party?the more absolutely senseless
 of the two?devoted its attention to the dead souls: the women's
 party occupied itself exclusively with the alleged abduction of the
 Governor's daughter. And here it may be said (to the ladies' credit) that
 the women's party displayed far more method and caution than did its rival
 faction, probably because the function in life of its members had always
 been that of managing and administering a household. With the ladies,
 therefore, matters soon assumed vivid and definite shape; they became
 clearly and irrefutably materialised; they stood stripped of all doubt and
 other impedimenta. Said some of the ladies in question, Chichikov had long
 been in love with the maiden, and the pair had kept tryst by the light of
 the moon, while the Governor would have given his consent (seeing that
 Chichikov was as rich as a Jew) but for the obstacle that Chichikov had
 deserted a wife already (how the worthy dames came to know that he was
 married remains a mystery), and the said deserted wife, pining with love
 for her faithless husband, had sent the Governor a letter of the most
 touching kind, so that Chichikov, on perceiving that the father and mother
 would never give their consent, had decided to abduct the girl. In other
 circles the matter was stated in a different way. That is to say, this
 section averred that Chichikov did NOT possess a wife, but that, as a man
 of subtlety and experience, he had bethought him of obtaining the
 daughter's hand through the expedient of first tackling the mother and
 carrying on with her an ardent liaison, and that, thereafter, he had made
 an application for the desired hand, but that the mother, fearing to
 commit a sin against religion, and feeling in her heart certain gnawings
 of conscience, had returned a blank refusal to Chichikov's request;
 whereupon Chichikov had decided to carry out the abduction alleged. To the
 foregoing, of course, there became appended various additional proofs and
 items of evidence, in proportion as the sensation spread to more remote
 corners of the town. At length, with these perfectings, the affair reached
 the ears of the Governor's wife herself. Naturally, as the mother of a
 family, and as the first lady in the town, and as a matron who had never
 before been suspected of things of the kind, she was highly offended when
 she heard the stories, and very justly so: with the result that her poor
 young daughter, though innocent, had to endure about as unpleasant a
 tete-a-tete as ever befell a maiden of sixteen, while, for his part, the
 Swiss footman received orders never at any time to admit Chichikov to the
 house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Having done their business with the Governor's wife, the ladies' party
 descended upon the male section, with a view to influencing it to their
 own side by asserting that the dead souls were an invention used solely
 for the purpose of diverting suspicion and successfully affecting the
 abduction. And, indeed, more than one man was converted, and joined the
 feminine camp, in spite of the fact that thereby such seceders incurred
 strong names from their late comrades?names such as "old women,"
 "petticoats," and others of a nature peculiarly offensive to the male sex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Also, however much they might arm themselves and take the field, the men
 could not compass such orderliness within their ranks as could the women.
 With the former everything was of the antiquated and rough-hewn and
 ill-fitting and unsuitable and badly-adapted and inferior kind; their
 heads were full of nothing but discord and triviality and confusion and
 slovenliness of thought. In brief, they displayed everywhere the male
 bent, the rude, ponderous nature which is incapable either of managing a
 household or of jumping to a conclusion, as well as remains always
 distrustful and lazy and full of constant doubt and everlasting timidity.
 For instance, the men's party declared that the whole story was rubbish?that
 the alleged abduction of the Governor's daughter was the work rather of a
 military than of a civilian culprit; that the ladies were lying when they
 accused Chichikov of the deed; that a woman was like a money-bag?whatsoever
 you put into her she thenceforth retained; that the subject which really
 demanded attention was the dead souls, of which the devil only knew the
 meaning, but in which there certainly lurked something that was contrary
 to good order and discipline. One reason why the men's party was so
 certain that the dead souls connoted something contrary to good order and
 discipline, was that there had just been appointed to the province a new
 Governor-General?an event which, of course, had thrown the whole
 army of provincial tchinovniks into a state of great excitement, seeing
 that they knew that before long there would ensue transferments and
 sentences of censure, as well as the series of official dinners with which
 a Governor-General is accustomed to entertain his subordinates. "Alas,"
 thought the army of tchinovniks, "it is probable that, should he learn of
 the gross reports at present afloat in our town, he will make such a fuss
 that we shall never hear the last of them." In particular did the Director
 of the Medical Department turn pale at the thought that possibly the new
 Governor-General would surmise the term "dead folk" to connote patients in
 the local hospitals who, for want of proper preventative measures, had
 died of sporadic fever. Indeed, might it not be that Chichikov was neither
 more nor less than an emissary of the said Governor-General, sent to
 conduct a secret inquiry? Accordingly he (the Director of the Medical
 Department) communicated this last supposition to the President of the
 Council, who, though at first inclined to ejaculate "Rubbish!" suddenly
 turned pale on propounding to himself the theory. "What if the souls
 purchased by Chichikov should REALLY be dead ones?"?a terrible
 thought considering that he, the President, had permitted their
 transferment to be registered, and had himself acted as Plushkin's
 representative! What if these things should reach the Governor-General's
 ears? He mentioned the matter to one friend and another, and they, in
 their turn, went white to the lips, for panic spreads faster and is even
 more destructive, than the dreaded black death. Also, to add to the
 tchinovniks' troubles, it so befell that just at this juncture there came
 into the local Governor's hands two documents of great importance. The
 first of them contained advices that, according to received evidence and
 reports, there was operating in the province a forger of rouble-notes who
 had been passing under various aliases and must therefore be sought for
 with the utmost diligence; while the second document was a letter from the
 Governor of a neighbouring province with regard to a malefactor who had
 there evaded apprehension?a letter conveying also a warning that, if
 in the province of the town of N. there should appear any suspicious
 individual who could produce neither references nor passports, he was to
 be arrested forthwith. These two documents left every one thunderstruck,
 for they knocked on the head all previous conceptions and theories. Not
 for a moment could it be supposed that the former document referred to
 Chichikov; yet, as each man pondered the position from his own point of
 view, he remembered that no one REALLY knew who Chichikov was; as also
 that his vague references to himself had?yes!?included
 statements that his career in the service had suffered much to the cause
 of Truth, and that he possessed a number of enemies who were seeking his
 life. This gave the tchinovniks further food for thought. Perhaps his life
 really DID stand in danger? Perhaps he really WAS being sought for by some
 one? Perhaps he really HAD done something of the kind above referred to?
 As a matter of fact, who was he??not that it could actually be
 supposed that he was a forger of notes, still less a brigand, seeing that
 his exterior was respectable in the highest degree. Yet who was he? At
 length the tchinovniks decided to make enquiries among those of whom he
 had purchased souls, in order that at least it might be learnt what the
 purchases had consisted of, and what exactly underlay them, and whether,
 in passing, he had explained to any one his real intentions, or revealed
 to any one his identity. In the first instance, therefore, resort was had
 to Korobotchka. Yet little was gleaned from that source?merely a
 statement that he had bought of her some souls for fifteen roubles apiece,
 and also a quantity of feathers, while promising also to buy some other
 commodities in the future, seeing that, in particular, he had entered into
 a contract with the Treasury for lard, a fact constituting fairly
 presumptive proof that the man was a rogue, seeing that just such another
 fellow had bought a quantity of feathers, yet had cheated folk all round,
 and, in particular, had done the Archpriest out of over a hundred roubles.
 Thus the net result of Madame's cross-examination was to convince the
 tchinovniks that she was a garrulous, silly old woman. With regard to
 Manilov, he replied that he would answer for Chichikov as he would for
 himself, and that he would gladly sacrifice his property in toto if
 thereby he could attain even a tithe of the qualities which Paul
 Ivanovitch possessed. Finally, he delivered on Chichikov, with
 acutely-knitted brows, a eulogy couched in the most charming of terms, and
 coupled with sundry sentiments on the subject of friendship and affection
 in general. True, these remarks sufficed to indicate the tender impulses
 of the speaker's heart, but also they did nothing to enlighten his
 examiners concerning the business that was actually at hand. As for
 Sobakevitch, that landowner replied that he considered Chichikov an
 excellent fellow, as well as that the souls whom he had sold to his
 visitor had been in the truest sense of the word alive, but that he could
 not answer for anything which might occur in the future, seeing that any
 difficulties which might arise in the course of the actual transferment of
 souls would not be HIS fault, in view of the fact that God was lord of
 all, and that fevers and other mortal complaints were so numerous in the
 world, and that instances of whole villages perishing through the same
 could be found on record.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, our friends the tchinovniks found themselves compelled to resort
 to an expedient which, though not particularly savoury, is not
 infrequently employed?namely, the expedient of getting lacqueys
 quietly to approach the servants of the person concerning whom information
 is desired, and to ascertain from them (the servants) certain details with
 regard to their master's life and antecedents. Yet even from this source
 very little was obtained, since Petrushka provided his interrogators
 merely with a taste of the smell of his living-room, and Selifan confined
 his replies to a statement that the barin had "been in the employment of
 the State, and also had served in the Customs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In short, the sum total of the results gathered by the tchinovniks was
 that they still stood in ignorance of Chichikov's identity, but that he
 MUST be some one; wherefore it was decided to hold a final debate on the
 subject on what ought to be done, and who Chichikov could possibly be, and
 whether or not he was a man who ought to be apprehended and detained as
 not respectable, or whether he was a man who might himself be able to
 apprehend and detain THEM as persons lacking in respectability. The debate
 in question, it was proposed, should be held at the residence of the Chief
 of Police, who is known to our readers as the father and the general
 benefactor of the town.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER X
 </h2>
 <p>
 On assembling at the residence indicated, the tchinovniks had occasion to
 remark that, owing to all these cares and excitements, every one of their
 number had grown thinner. Yes, the appointment of a new Governor-General,
 coupled with the rumours described and the reception of the two serious
 documents above-mentioned, had left manifest traces upon the features of
 every one present. More than one frockcoat had come to look too large for
 its wearer, and more than one frame had fallen away, including the frames
 of the President of the Council, the Director of the Medical Department,
 and the Public Prosecutor. Even a certain Semen Ivanovitch, who, for some
 reason or another, was never alluded to by his family name, but who wore
 on his index finger a ring with which he was accustomed to dazzle his lady
 friends, had diminished in bulk. Yet, as always happens at such junctures,
 there were also present a score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in
 NOT losing their presence of mind, even though they constituted a mere
 sprinkling. Of them the Postmaster formed one, since he was a man of
 equable temperament who could always say: "WE know you, Governor-Generals!
 We have seen three or four of you come and go, whereas WE have been
 sitting on the same stools these thirty years." Nevertheless a prominent
 feature of the gathering was the total absence of what is vulgarly known
 as "common sense." In general, we Russians do not make a good show at
 representative assemblies, for the reason that, unless there be in
 authority a leading spirit to control the rest, the affair always develops
 into confusion. Why this should be so one could hardly say, but at all
 events a success is scored only by such gatherings as have for their
 object dining and festivity?to wit, gatherings at clubs or in
 German-run restaurants. However, on the present occasion, the meeting was
 NOT one of this kind; it was a meeting convoked of necessity, and likely
 in view of the threatened calamity to affect every tchinovnik in the
 place. Also, in addition to the great divergency of views expressed
 thereat, there was visible in all the speakers an invincible tendency to
 indecision which led them at one moment to make assertions, and at the
 next to contradict the same. But on at least one point all seemed to agree?namely,
 that Chichikov's appearance and conversation were too respectable for him
 to be a forger or a disguised brigand. That is to say, all SEEMED to agree
 on the point; until a sudden shout arose from the direction of the
 Postmaster, who for some time past had been sitting plunged in thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>I</i> can tell you," he cried, "who Chichikov is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who, then?" replied the crowd in great excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is none other than Captain Kopeikin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And who may Captain Kopeikin be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Taking a pinch of snuff (which he did with the lid of his snuff-box
 half-open, lest some extraneous person should contrive to insert a not
 over-clean finger into the stuff), the Postmaster related the following
 story <small>35</small>.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After fighting in the campaign of 1812, there was sent home, wounded, a
 certain Captain Kopeikin?a headstrong, lively blade who, whether on
 duty or under arrest, made things lively for everybody. Now, since at
 Krasni or at Leipzig (it matters not which) he had lost an arm and a leg,
 and in those days no provision was made for wounded soldiers, and he could
 not work with his left arm alone, he set out to see his father.
 Unfortunately his father could only just support himself, and was forced
 to tell his son so; wherefore the Captain decided to go and apply for help
 in St. Petersburg, seeing that he had risked his life for his country, and
 had lost much blood in its service. You can imagine him arriving in the
 capital on a baggage waggon?in the capital which is like no other
 city in the world! Before him there lay spread out the whole field of
 life, like a sort of Arabian Nights?a picture made up of the Nevski
 Prospect, Gorokhovaia Street, countless tapering spires, and a number of
 bridges apparently supported on nothing?in fact, a regular second
 Nineveh. Well, he made shift to hire a lodging, but found everything so
 wonderfully furnished with blinds and Persian carpets and so forth that he
 saw it would mean throwing away a lot of money. True, as one walks the
 streets of St. Petersburg one seems to smell money by the thousand
 roubles, but our friend Kopeikin's bank was limited to a few score coppers
 and a little silver?not enough to buy a village with! At length, at
 the price of a rouble a day, he obtained a lodging in the sort of tavern
 where the daily ration is a bowl of cabbage soup and a crust of bread; and
 as he felt that he could not manage to live very long on fare of that kind
 he asked folk what he had better do. 'What you had better do?' they said.
 'Well the Government is not here?it is in Paris, and the troops have
 not yet returned from the war; but there is a TEMPORARY Commission
 sitting, and you had better go and see what IT can do for you.' 'All
 right!' he said. 'I will go and tell the Commission that I have shed my
 blood, and sacrificed my life, for my country.' And he got up early one
 morning, and shaved himself with his left hand (since the expense of a
 barber was not worth while), and set out, wooden leg and all, to see the
 President of the Commission. But first he asked where the President lived,
 and was told that his house was in Naberezhnaia Street. And you may be
 sure that it was no peasant's hut, with its glazed windows and great
 mirrors and statues and lacqueys and brass door handles! Rather, it was
 the sort of place which you would enter only after you had bought a cheap
 cake of soap and indulged in a two hours' wash. Also, at the entrance
 there was posted a grand Swiss footman with a baton and an embroidered
 collar?a fellow looking like a fat, over-fed pug dog. However,
 friend Kopeikin managed to get himself and his wooden leg into the
 reception room, and there squeezed himself away into a corner, for fear
 lest he should knock down the gilded china with his elbow. And he stood
 waiting in great satisfaction at having arrived before the President had
 so much as left his bed and been served with his silver wash-basin.
 Nevertheless, it was only when Kopeikin had been waiting four hours that a
 breakfast waiter entered to say, 'The President will soon be here.' By now
 the room was as full of people as a plate is of beans, and when the
 President left the breakfast-room he brought with him, oh, such dignity
 and refinement, and such an air of the metropolis! First he walked up to
 one person, and then up to another, saying: 'What do YOU want? And what do
 YOU want? What can I do for YOU? What is YOUR business?' And at length he
 stopped before Kopeikin, and Kopeikin said to him: 'I have shed my blood,
 and lost both an arm and a leg, for my country, and am unable to work.
 Might I therefore dare to ask you for a little help, if the regulations
 should permit of it, or for a gratuity, or for a pension, or something of
 the kind?' Then the President looked at him, and saw that one of his legs
 was indeed a wooden one, and that an empty right sleeve was pinned to his
 uniform. 'Very well,' he said. 'Come to me again in a few days' time.'
 Upon this friend Kopeikin felt delighted. 'NOW I have done my job!' he
 thought to himself; and you may imagine how gaily he trotted along the
 pavement, and how he dropped into a tavern for a glass of vodka, and how
 he ordered a cutlet and some caper sauce and some other things for
 luncheon, and how he called for a bottle of wine, and how he went to the
 theatre in the evening! In short, he did himself thoroughly well. Next, he
 saw in the street a young English lady, as graceful as a swan, and set off
 after her on his wooden leg. 'But no,' he thought to himself. 'To the
 devil with that sort of thing just now! I will wait until I have drawn my
 pension. For the present I have spent enough.' (And I may tell you that by
 now he had got through fully half his money.) Two or three days later he
 went to see the President of the Commission again. 'I should be glad to
 know,' he said, 'whether by now you can do anything for me in return for
 my having shed my blood and suffered sickness and wounds on military
 service.' 'First of all,' said the President, 'I must tell you that
 nothing can be decided in your case without the authority of the Supreme
 Government. Without that sanction we cannot move in the matter. Surely you
 see how things stand until the army shall have returned from the war? All
 that I can advise you to do is wait for the Minister to return, and, in
 the meanwhile, to have patience. Rest assured that then you will not be
 overlooked. And if for the moment you have nothing to live upon, this is
 the best that I can do for you.' With that he handed Kopeikin a trifle
 until his case should have been decided. However, that was not what
 Kopeikin wanted. He had supposed that he would be given a gratuity of a
 thousand roubles straight away; whereas, instead of 'Drink and be merry,'
 it was 'Wait, for the time is not yet.' Thus, though his head had been
 full of soup plates and cutlets and English girls, he now descended the
 steps with his ears and his tail down?looking, in fact, like a
 poodle over which the cook has poured a bucketful of water. You see, St.
 Petersburg life had changed him not a little since first he had got a
 taste of it, and, now that the devil only knew how he was going to live,
 it came all the harder to him that he should have no more sweets to look
 forward to. Remember that a man in the prime of years has an appetite like
 a wolf; and as he passed a restaurant he could see a round-faced,
 holland-shirted, snow-white aproned fellow of a French chef preparing a
 dish delicious enough to make it turn to and eat itself; while, again, as
 he passed a fruit shop he could see delicacies looking out of a window for
 fools to come and buy them at a hundred roubles apiece. Imagine,
 therefore, his position! On the one hand, so to speak, were salmon and
 water-melons, while on the other hand was the bitter fare which passed at
 a tavern for luncheon. 'Well,' he thought to himself, 'let them do what
 they like with me at the Commission, but I intend to go and raise the
 whole place, and to tell every blessed functionary there that I have a
 mind to do as I choose.' And in truth this bold impertinence of a man did
 have the hardihood to return to the Commission. 'What do you want?' said
 the President. 'Why are you here for the third time? You have had your
 orders given you.' 'I daresay I have,' he retorted, 'but I am not going to
 be put off with THEM. I want some cutlets to eat, and a bottle of French
 wine, and a chance to go and amuse myself at the theatre.' 'Pardon me,'
 said the President. 'What you really need (if I may venture to mention it)
 is a little patience. You have been given something for food until the
 Military Committee shall have met, and then, doubtless, you will receive
 your proper reward, seeing that it would not be seemly that a man who has
 served his country should be left destitute. On the other hand, if, in the
 meanwhile, you desire to indulge in cutlets and theatre-going, please
 understand that we cannot help you, but you must make your own resources,
 and try as best you can to help yourself.' You can imagine that this went
 in at one of Kopeikin's ears, and out at the other; that it was like
 shooting peas at a stone wall. Accordingly he raised a turmoil which sent
 the staff flying. One by one, he gave the mob of secretaries and clerks a
 real good hammering. 'You, and you, and you,' he said, 'do not even know
 your duties. You are law-breakers.' Yes, he trod every man of them under
 foot. At length the General himself arrived from another office, and
 sounded the alarm. What was to be done with a fellow like Kopeikin? The
 President saw that strong measures were imperative. 'Very well,' he said.
 'Since you decline to rest satisfied with what has been given you, and
 quietly to await the decision of your case in St. Petersburg, I must find
 you a lodging. Here, constable, remove the man to gaol.' Then a constable
 who had been called to the door?a constable three ells in height,
 and armed with a carbine?a man well fitted to guard a bank?placed
 our friend in a police waggon. 'Well,' reflected Kopeikin, 'at least I
 shan't have to pay my fare for THIS ride. That's one comfort.' Again,
 after he had ridden a little way, he said to himself: 'they told me at the
 Commission to go and make my own means of enjoying myself. Very good. I'll
 do so.' However, what became of Kopeikin, and whither he went, is known to
 no one. He sank, to use the poet's expression, into the waters of Lethe,
 and his doings now lie buried in oblivion. But allow me, gentlemen, to
 piece together the further threads of the story. Not two months later
 there appeared in the forests of Riazan a band of robbers: and of that
 band the chieftain was none other than?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Allow me," put in the Head of the Police Department. "You have said that
 Kopeikin had lost an arm and a leg; whereas Chichikov?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To say anything more was unnecessary. The Postmaster clapped his hand to
 his forehead, and publicly called himself a fool, though, later, he tried
 to excuse his mistake by saying that in England the science of mechanics
 had reached such a pitch that wooden legs were manufactured which would
 enable the wearer, on touching a spring, to vanish instantaneously from
 sight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Various other theories were then propounded, among them a theory that
 Chichikov was Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena and travelling about the
 world in disguise. And if it should be supposed that no such notion could
 possibly have been broached, let the reader remember that these events
 took place not many years after the French had been driven out of Russia,
 and that various prophets had since declared that Napoleon was Antichrist,
 and would one day escape from his island prison to exercise universal sway
 on earth. Nay, some good folk had even declared the letters of Napoleon's
 name to constitute the Apocalyptic cipher!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As a last resort, the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev, since not
 only had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls, but also he
 was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov. Accordingly the
 Chief of Police dispatched a note by the hand of a commissionaire. At the
 time Nozdrev was engaged on some very important business?so much so
 that he had not left his room for four days, and was receiving his meals
 through the window, and no visitors at all. The business referred to
 consisted of the marking of several dozen selected cards in such a way as
 to permit of his relying upon them as upon his bosom friend. Naturally he
 did not like having his retirement invaded, and at first consigned the
 commissionaire to the devil; but as soon as he learnt from the note that,
 since a novice at cards was to be the guest of the Chief of Police that
 evening, a call at the latter's house might prove not wholly unprofitable
 he relented, unlocked the door of his room, threw on the first garments
 that came to hand, and set forth. To every question put to him by the
 tchinovniks he answered firmly and with assurance. Chichikov, he averred,
 had indeed purchased dead souls, and to the tune of several thousand
 roubles. In fact, he (Nozdrev) had himself sold him some, and still saw no
 reason why he should not have done so. Next, to the question of whether or
 not he considered Chichikov to be a spy, he replied in the affirmative,
 and added that, as long ago as his and Chichikov's joint schooldays, the
 said Chichikov had been known as "The Informer," and repeatedly been
 thrashed by his companions on that account. Again, to the question of
 whether or not Chichikov was a forger of currency notes the deponent, as
 before, responded in the affirmative, and appended thereto an anecdote
 illustrative of Chichikov's extraordinary dexterity of hand?namely,
 an anecdote to that effect that, once upon a time, on learning that two
 million roubles worth of counterfeit notes were lying in Chichikov's
 house, the authorities had placed seals upon the building, and had
 surrounded it on every side with an armed guard; whereupon Chichikov had,
 during the night, changed each of these seals for a new one, and also so
 arranged matters that, when the house was searched, the forged notes were
 found to be genuine ones!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov had schemed to abduct
 the Governor's daughter, and also whether it was true that he, Nozdrev,
 had undertaken to aid and abet him in the act, the witness replied that,
 had he not undertaken to do so, the affair would never have come off. At
 this point the witness pulled himself up, on realising that he had told a
 lie which might get him into trouble; but his tongue was not to be denied?the
 details trembling on its tip were too alluring, and he even went on to
 cite the name of the village church where the pair had arranged to be
 married, that of the priest who had performed the ceremony, the amount of
 the fees paid for the same (seventy-five roubles), and statements (1) that
 the priest had refused to solemnise the wedding until Chichikov had
 frightened him by threatening to expose the fact that he (the priest) had
 married Mikhail, a local corn dealer, to his paramour, and (2) that
 Chichikov had ordered both a koliaska for the couple's conveyance and
 relays of horses from the post-houses on the road. Nay, the narrative, as
 detailed by Nozdrev, even reached the point of his mentioning certain of
 the postillions by name! Next, the tchinovniks sounded him on the question
 of Chichikov's possible identity with Napoleon; but before long they had
 reason to regret the step, for Nozdrev responded with a rambling rigmarole
 such as bore no resemblance to anything possibly conceivable. Finally, the
 majority of the audience left the room, and only the Chief of Police
 remained to listen (in the hope of gathering something more); but at last
 even he found himself forced to disclaim the speaker with a gesture which
 said: "The devil only knows what the fellow is talking about!" and so
 voiced the general opinion that it was no use trying to gather figs of
 thistles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile Chichikov knew nothing of these events; for, having contracted a
 slight chill, coupled with a sore throat, he had decided to keep his room
 for three days; during which time he gargled his throat with milk and fig
 juice, consumed the fruit from which the juice had been extracted, and
 wore around his neck a poultice of camomile and camphor. Also, to while
 away the hours, he made new and more detailed lists of the souls which he
 had bought, perused a work by the Duchesse de la Valliere <small>36</small>,
 rummaged in his portmanteau, looked through various articles and papers
 which he discovered in his dispatch-box, and found every one of these
 occupations tedious. Nor could he understand why none of his official
 friends had come to see him and inquire after his health, seeing that, not
 long since, there had been standing in front of the inn the drozhkis both
 of the Postmaster, the Public Prosecutor, and the President of the
 Council. He wondered and wondered, and then, with a shrug of his
 shoulders, fell to pacing the room. At length he felt better, and his
 spirits rose at the prospect of once more going out into the fresh air;
 wherefore, having shaved a plentiful growth of hair from his face, he
 dressed with such alacrity as almost to cause a split in his trousers,
 sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne, and wrapping himself in warm
 clothes, and turning up the collar of his coat, sallied forth into the
 street. His first destination was intended to be the Governor's mansion,
 and, as he walked along, certain thoughts concerning the Governor's
 daughter would keep whirling through his head, so that almost he forgot
 where he was, and took to smiling and cracking jokes to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Arrived at the Governor's entrance, he was about to divest himself of his
 scarf when a Swiss footman greeted him with the words, "I am forbidden to
 admit you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?" he exclaimed. "You do not know me? Look at me again, and see if
 you do not recognise me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course I recognise you," the footman replied. "I have seen you before,
 but have been ordered to admit any one else rather than Monsieur
 Chichikov."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? And why so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Those are my orders, and they must be obeyed," said the footman,
 confronting Chichikov with none of that politeness with which, on former
 occasions, he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings. Evidently
 he was of opinion that, since the gentry declined to receive the visitor,
 the latter must certainly be a rogue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I cannot understand it," said Chichikov to himself. Then he departed, and
 made his way to the house of the President of the Council. But so put
 about was that official by Chichikov's entry that he could not utter two
 consecutive words?he could only murmur some rubbish which left both
 his visitor and himself out of countenance. Chichikov wondered, as he left
 the house, what the President's muttered words could have meant, but
 failed to make head or tail of them. Next, he visited, in turn, the Chief
 of Police, the Vice-Governor, the Postmaster, and others; but in each case
 he either failed to be accorded admittance or was received so strangely,
 and with such a measure of constraint and conversational awkwardness and
 absence of mind and embarrassment, that he began to fear for the sanity of
 his hosts. Again and again did he strive to divine the cause, but could
 not do so; so he went wandering aimlessly about the town, without
 succeeding in making up his mind whether he or the officials had gone
 crazy. At length, in a state bordering upon bewilderment, he returned to
 the inn?to the establishment whence, that every afternoon, he had
 set forth in such exuberance of spirits. Feeling the need of something to
 do, he ordered tea, and, still marvelling at the strangeness of his
 position, was about to pour out the beverage when the door opened and
 Nozdrev made his appearance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What says the proverb?" he began. "'To see a friend, seven versts is not
 too long a round to make.' I happened to be passing the house, saw a light
 in your window, and thought to myself: 'Now, suppose I were to run up and
 pay him a visit? It is unlikely that he will be asleep.' Ah, ha! I see tea
 on your table! Good! Then I will drink a cup with you, for I had wretched
 stuff for dinner, and it is beginning to lie heavy on my stomach. Also,
 tell your man to fill me a pipe. Where is your own pipe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never smoke," rejoined Chichikov drily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rubbish! As if I did not know what a chimney-pot you are! What is your
 man's name? Hi, Vakhramei! Come here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Petrushka is his name, not Vakhramei."
 </p><br>

 "Indeed? But you USED to have a man called Vakhramei, didn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, never."

 "Oh, well. Then it must be Derebin's man I am thinking of. What a lucky
 fellow that Derebin is! An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled with her
 son for marrying a serf woman, and has left all her property to HIM, to
 Derebin. Would that <i>I</i> had an aunt of that kind to provide against
 future contingencies! But why have you been hiding yourself away? I
 suppose the reason has been that you go in for abstruse subjects and are
 fond of reading" (why Nozdrev should have drawn these conclusions no one
 could possibly have said?least of all Chichikov himself). "By the
 way, I can tell you of something that would have found you scope for your
 satirical vein" (the conclusion as to Chichikov's "satirical vein" was, as
 before, altogether unwarranted on Nozdrev's part). "That is to say, you
 would have seen merchant Likhachev losing a pile of money at play. My
 word, you would have laughed! A fellow with me named Perependev said:
 'Would that Chichikov had been here! It would have been the very thing for
 him!'" (As a matter of fact, never since the day of his birth had Nozdrev
 met any one of the name of Perependev.) "However, my friend, you must
 admit that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that game of
 chess; but, as I won the game, I bear you no malice. A propos, I am just
 from the President's, and ought to tell you that the feeling against you
 in the town is very strong, for every one believes you to be a forger of
 currency notes. I myself was sent for and questioned about you, but I
 stuck up for you through thick and thin, and told the tchinovniks that I
 had been at school with you, and had known your father. In fact, I gave
 the fellows a knock or two for themselves."

 "You say that I am believed to be a forger?" said Chichikov, starting from
 his seat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Nozdrev. "Why have you gone and frightened everybody as you
 have done? Some of our folk are almost out of their minds about it, and
 declare you to be either a brigand in disguise or a spy. Yesterday the
 Public Prosecutor even died of it, and is to be buried to-morrow" (this
 was true in so far as that, on the previous day, the official in question
 had had a fatal stroke?probably induced by the excitement of the
 public meeting). "Of course, <i>I</i> don't suppose you to be anything of
 the kind, but, you see, these fellows are in a blue funk about the new
 Governor-General, for they think he will make trouble for them over your
 affair. A propos, he is believed to be a man who puts on airs, and turns
 up his nose at everything; and if so, he will get on badly with the
 dvoriane, seeing that fellows of that sort need to be humoured a bit. Yes,
 my word! Should the new Governor-General shut himself up in his study, and
 give no balls, there will be the very devil to pay! By the way, Chichikov,
 that is a risky scheme of yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What scheme to you mean?" Chichikov asked uneasily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, that scheme of carrying off the Governor's daughter. However, to
 tell the truth, I was expecting something of the kind. No sooner
