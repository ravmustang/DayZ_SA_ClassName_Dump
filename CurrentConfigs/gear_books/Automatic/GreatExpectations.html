 <h2>
 Chapter I
 </h2>
 <p>
 My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
 infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
 than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his
 tombstone and my sister,?Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the
 blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any
 likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of
 photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were
 unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my
 father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with
 curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, "Also
 Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that my mother
 was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot
 and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and
 were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,?who gave
 up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,?I
 am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been
 born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had
 never taken them out in this state of existence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound,
 twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the
 identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw
 afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that
 this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that
 Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above,
 were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias,
 and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried;
 and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with
 dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the
 marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the
 distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that
 the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry,
 was Pip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among
 the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you little devil,
 or I'll cut your throat!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man
 with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
 head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed
 by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars;
 who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth
 chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir," I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do it,
 sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell us your name!" said the man. "Quick!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Once more," said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip. Pip, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Show us where you live," said the man. "Pint out the place!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
 alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
 emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When
 the church came to itself,?for he was so sudden and strong that he
 made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,?when
 the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone,
 trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You young dog," said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you ha'
 got."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
 years, and not strong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Darn me if I couldn't eat em," said the man, with a threatening shake of
 his head, "and if I han't half a mind to't!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the
 tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly,
 to keep myself from crying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now lookee here!" said the man. "Where's your mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, sir!" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, sir!" I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. That's my mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" said he, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your mother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir," said I; "him too; late of this parish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha!" he muttered then, considering. "Who d'ye live with,?supposin'
 you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My sister, sir,?Mrs. Joe Gargery,?wife of Joe Gargery, the
 blacksmith, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blacksmith, eh?" said he. And looked down at his leg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to my
 tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he could
 hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine
 looked most helplessly up into his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now lookee here," he said, "the question being whether you're to be let
 to live. You know what a file is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you know what wittles is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
 greater sense of helplessness and danger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You get me a file." He tilted me again. "And you get me wittles." He
 tilted me again. "You bring 'em both to me." He tilted me again. "Or I'll
 have your heart and liver out." He tilted me again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both
 hands, and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir,
 perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over
 its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright position
 on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You
 bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you
 never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having
 seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to
 live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how
 small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted, and
 ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young man hid
 with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young man
 hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar to
 himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It is in
 wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A boy may
 lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the
 clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that
 young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open. I
 am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment,
 with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of
 your inside. Now, what do you say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken bits
 of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in the
 morning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!" said the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said so, and he took me down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," he pursued, "you remember what you've undertook, and you remember
 that young man, and you get home!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goo-good night, sir," I faltered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Much of that!" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. "I
 wish I was a frog. Or a eel!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms,?clasping
 himself, as if to hold himself together,?and limped towards the low
 church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the nettles, and among
 the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked in my young eyes as if
 he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out
 of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs
 were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I saw
 him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs.
 But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on again
 towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking his way
 with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here
 and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was
 in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to
 look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly
 so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red
 lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the river I could
 faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed
 to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors
 steered,?like an unhooped cask upon a pole,?an ugly thing when
 you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it
 which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on towards this latter,
 as if he were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to
 hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and
 as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him, I wondered
 whether they thought so too. I looked all round for the horrible young
 man, and could see no signs of him. But now I was frightened again, and
 ran home without stopping.

 <h2>
 Chapter II
 </h2>
 <p>
 My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and
 had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because
 she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find out for
 myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy
 hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as
 upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
 impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe was
 a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and
 with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow
 got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild, good-natured,
 sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,?a sort of Hercules
 in strength, and also in weakness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
 redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
 she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall and
 bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure
 behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that
 was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful merit in
 herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this apron so
 much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all; or
 why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it off, every
 day of her life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the
 dwellings in our country were,?most of them, at that time. When I
 ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting
 alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having
 confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised
 the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the
 chimney corner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she's out
 now, making it a baker's dozen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Pip," said Joe; "and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
 round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler was a
 wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She sot down," said Joe, "and she got up, and she made a grab at Tickler,
 and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did," said Joe, slowly clearing the
 fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it; "she
 Ram-paged out, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has she been gone long, Joe?" I always treated him as a larger species of
 child, and as no more than my equal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "she's been on the
 Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She's a coming! Get
 behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open, and
 finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and
 applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing me?I
 often served as a connubial missile?at Joe, who, glad to get hold of
 me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up
 there with his great leg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Mrs. Joe, stamping her foot.
 "Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and
 fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty
 Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have only been to the churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and
 rubbing myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warn't for me you'd have been to
 the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by hand?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I whimpered, "I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't!" said my sister. "I'd never do it again! I know that. I may
 truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were. It's
 bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without being
 your mother."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the
 fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
 mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
 under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me in
 the avenging coals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hah!" said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. "Churchyard,
 indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two." One of us, by the by, had
 not said it at all. "You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of
 these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me over
 his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating
 what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous
 circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his right-side
 flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes,
 as his manner always was at squally times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us, that
 never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast
 against her bib,?where it sometimes got a pin into it, and sometimes
 a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she took some
 butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an
 apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,?using both
 sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding
 the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart
 wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the
 loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two
 halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice. I
 felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance,
 and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew Mrs. Joe's
 housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches
 might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore I resolved to put my
 hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
 found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
 from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water. And
 it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our
 already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his good-natured
 companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit
 through our slices, by silently holding them up to each other's admiration
 now and then,?which stimulated us to new exertions. To-night, Joe
 several times invited me, by the display of his fast diminishing slice, to
 enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time,
 with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter
 on the other. At last, I desperately considered that the thing I
 contemplated must be done, and that it had best be done in the least
 improbable manner consistent with the circumstances. I took advantage of a
 moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my
 leg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of
 appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didn't
 seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual,
 pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill.
 He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on one side
 for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw that my
 bread and butter was gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of
 his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's
 observation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter now?" said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, you know!" muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious
 remonstrance. "Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll stick
 somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter now?" repeated my sister, more sharply than before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,"
 said Joe, all aghast. "Manners is manners, but still your elth's your
 elth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe, and,
 taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while
 against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily
 on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter," said my sister, out of
 breath, "you staring great stuck pig."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked
 at me again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, Pip," said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek, and
 speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, "you and
 me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time. But
 such a?" he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us,
 and then again at me?"such a most oncommon Bolt as that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Been bolting his food, has he?" cried my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, old chap," said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with
 his bite still in his cheek, "I Bolted, myself, when I was your age?frequent?and
 as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting
 equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing
 more than the awful words, "You come along and be dosed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine,
 and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief
 in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the best of times, so
 much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative, that I
 was conscious of going about, smelling like a new fence. On this
 particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture,
 which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe
 held my head under her arm, as a boot would be held in a bootjack. Joe got
 off with half a pint; but was made to swallow that (much to his
 disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire),
 "because he had had a turn." Judging from myself, I should say he
 certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had none before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in
 the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret
 burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great
 punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe?I
 never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
 housekeeping property as his?united to the necessity of always
 keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered
 about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.
 Then, as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard
 the voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
 secrecy, declaring that he couldn't and wouldn't starve until to-morrow,
 but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man who
 was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
 should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,
 and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,
 instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror,
 mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's ever did?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a
 copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with the
 load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the load
 on <i>his</i> leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
 and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,
 and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hark!" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm
 in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; "was that great guns,
 Joe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Joe. "There's another conwict off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What does that mean, Joe?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
 "Escaped. Escaped." Administering the definition like Tar-water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my
 mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, "What's a convict?" Joe put his
 mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I
 could make out nothing of it but the single word "Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There was a conwict off last night," said Joe, aloud, "after sunset-gun.
 And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're firing warning
 of another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's firing?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drat that boy," interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work, "what
 a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
 told lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite
 unless there was company.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
 pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word
 that looked to me like "sulks." Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.
 Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, "her?" But Joe wouldn't
 hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook the
 form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of the
 word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Joe," said I, as a last resort, "I should like to know?if you
 wouldn't much mind?where the firing comes from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord bless the boy!" exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean
 that but rather the contrary. "From the Hulks!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh-h!" said I, looking at Joe. "Hulks!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, "Well, I told you so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And please, what's Hulks?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's the way with this boy!" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out with
 her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. "Answer him one
 question, and he'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,
 right 'cross th' meshes." We always used that name for marshes, in our
 country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?" said I,
 in a general way, and with quiet desperation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. "I tell you what,
 young fellow," said she, "I didn't bring you up by hand to badger people's
 lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had. People are
 put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and forge, and
 do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking questions. Now, you
 get along to bed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went up stairs
 in the dark, with my head tingling,?from Mrs. Joe's thimble having
 played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,?I felt
 fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for
 me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking questions, and I
 was going to rob Mrs. Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought that
 few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror. No matter
 how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in mortal terror
 of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of
 my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from
 whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance
 through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid
 to think of what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my
 terror.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down
 the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate calling
 out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbet-station, that
 I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put it off.
 I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been inclined, for I knew that at the
 first faint dawn of morning I must rob the pantry. There was no doing it
 in the night, for there was no getting a light by easy friction then; to
 have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a
 noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
 with gray, I got up and went down stairs; every board upon the way, and
 every crack in every board calling after me, "Stop thief!" and "Get up,
 Mrs. Joe!" In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than
 usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up
 by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught when my back was half turned,
 winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time
 for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread, some rind of
 cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in my
 pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some brandy from a stone
 bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for
 making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room:
 diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone
 with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was
 nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a
 shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered
 earthen ware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and I took it
 in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would not be
 missed for some time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked
 and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools. Then I put
 the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which I had entered
 when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty marshes.

 <h2>
 Chapter III
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the
 outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all
 night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp
 lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders'
 webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail
 and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden
 finger on the post directing people to our village?a direction which
 they never accepted, for they never came there?was invisible to me
 until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it
 dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me
 to the Hulks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that instead
 of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me. This was very
 disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and banks came bursting
 at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly as could be, "A boy
 with Somebody's else's pork pie! Stop him!" The cattle came upon me with
 like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their
 nostrils, "Halloa, young thief!" One black ox, with a white cravat on,?who
 even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air,?fixed
 me so obstinately with his eyes, and moved his blunt head round in such an
 accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to him, "I
 couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't for myself I took it!" Upon which he put
 down his head, blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a
 kick-up of his hind-legs and a flourish of his tail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I
 went, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as
 the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew
 my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a
 Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I
 was 'prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!
 However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to
 the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the
 bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
 out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a
 ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled up
 the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me. His back
 was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy
 with sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast, in
 that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on the
 shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another
 man!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron on
 his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that the
 other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat
 broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for I
 had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at me,?it
 was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down, for
 it made him stumble,?and then he ran into the mist, stumbling twice
 as he went, and I lost him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's the young man!" I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified
 him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had known
 where it was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right Man,?hugging
 himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all night left off
 hugging and limping,?waiting for me. He was awfully cold, to be
 sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of
 deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when I handed him
 the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to me he would have
 tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did not turn me upside
 down this time to get at what I had, but left me right side upwards while
 I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's in the bottle, boy?" said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Brandy," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
 manner,?more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a
 violent hurry, than a man who was eating it,?but he left off to take
 some of the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was
 quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his
 teeth, without biting it off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think you have got the ague," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm much of your opinion, boy," said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's bad about here," I told him. "You've been lying out on the meshes,
 and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me," said he. "I'd do
 that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
 over there, directly afterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all at
 once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us, and
 often stopping?even stopping his jaws?to listen. Some real or
 fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
 marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, sir! No!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said he, "I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young hound indeed,
 if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted
 as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,
 and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his
 eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down upon
 the pie, I made bold to say, "I am glad you enjoy it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you speak?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I said I was glad you enjoyed it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thankee, my boy. I do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now noticed
 a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the man's. The
 man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He swallowed, or
 rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast; and he looked
 sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought there was danger in
 every direction of somebody's coming to take the pie away. He was
 altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably
 I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without making a chop with
 his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars he was very like the
 dog.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am afraid you won't leave any of it for him," said I, timidly; after a
 silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making the
 remark. "There's no more to be got where that came from." It was the
 certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave any for him? Who's him?" said my friend, stopping in his crunching
 of pie-crust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh ah!" he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. "Him? Yes, yes!
 He don't want no wittles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought he looked as if he did," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the
 greatest surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looked? When?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yonder," said I, pointing; "over there, where I found him nodding asleep,
 and thought it was you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his
 first idea about cutting my throat had revived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat," I explained, trembling;
 "and?and"?I was very anxious to put this delicately?"and
 with?the same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear
 the cannon last night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then there was firing!" he said to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that," I returned, "for we heard
 it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in besides."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, see now!" said he. "When a man's alone on these flats, with a light
 head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears nothin' all
 night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees the soldiers,
 with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore, closing in
 round him. Hears his number called, hears himself challenged, hears the
 rattle of the muskets, hears the orders 'Make ready! Present! Cover him
 steady, men!' and is laid hands on?and there's nothin'! Why, if I
 see one pursuing party last night?coming up in order, Damn 'em, with
 their tramp, tramp?I see a hundred. And as to firing! Why, I see the
 mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day,?But this man";
 he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my being there; "did you
 notice anything in him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He had a badly bruised face," said I, recalling what I hardly knew I
 knew.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not here?" exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with
 the flat of his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, there!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where is he?" He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of
 his gray jacket. "Show me the way he went. I'll pull him down, like a
 bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,
 boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and he
 looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet grass,
 filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding his own
 leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he handled
 as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I was very
 much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into this fierce
 hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any
 longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so I thought the best
 thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw of him, his head was bent
 over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter, muttering impatient
 imprecations at it and at his leg. The last I heard of him, I stopped in
 the mist to listen, and the file was still going.

 <h2>
 Chapter IV
 </h2>
 <p>
 I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me
 up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet
 been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
 house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the
 kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,?an article into
 which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was
 vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And where the deuce ha' you been?" was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation,
 when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said I had been down to hear the Carols. "Ah! well!" observed Mrs. Joe.
 "You might ha' done worse." Not a doubt of that I thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a
 slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,"
 said Mrs. Joe. "I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best
 of reasons for my never hearing any."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired
 before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory
 air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were
 withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me,
 as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so much her
 normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to
 our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
 greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had been
 made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being
 missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive
 arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
 breakfast; "for I ain't," said Mrs. Joe,?"I ain't a going to have no
 formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before
 me, I promise you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a
 forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk
 and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In the
 meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered
 flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the
 little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any
 other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver
 paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on
 the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his
 mouth, and each the counterpart of the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean
 housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more
 uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to
 Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is
 to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a well-knit
 characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he was more
 like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else. Nothing that
 he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and everything that he
 wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion he emerged from his
 room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full
 suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my sister must have had
 some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman
 had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over to her, to be dealt with
 according to the outraged majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I
 had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason,
 religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments of my best
 friends. Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor
 had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to
 let me have the free use of my limbs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
 for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what
 I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had
 gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the
 remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done. Under the
 weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be
 powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man,
 if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the idea that the time
 when the banns were read and when the clergyman said, "Ye are now to
 declare it!" would be the time for me to rise and propose a private
 conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I might not have
 astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure,
 but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the
 wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle, but Mrs.
 Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest
 town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was half-past one.
 When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed,
 and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any
 other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid. And
 still, not a word of the robbery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and the
 company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald
 forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was
 understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his
 head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed that if
 the Church was "thrown open," meaning to competition, he would not despair
 of making his mark in it. The Church not being "thrown open," he was, as I
 have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens tremendously; and when he
 gave out the psalm,?always giving the whole verse,?he looked
 all round the congregation first, as much as to say, "You have heard my
 friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I opened the door to the company,?making believe that it was a habit
 of ours to open that door,?and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next
 to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was
 not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Joe," said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged
 slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair
 standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been all
 but choked, and had that moment come to, "I have brought you as the
 compliments of the season?I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of
 sherry wine?and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with
 exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
 Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, "O, Un?cle
 Pum-ble?chook! This is kind!" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as
 he now retorted, "It's no more than your merits. And now are you all
 bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?" meaning me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts
 and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Joe's
 change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was
 uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more
 gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember
 Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a
 conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,?I
 don't know at what remote period,?when she was much younger than he.
 I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a
 sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in
 my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I
 met him coming up the lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't robbed
 the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in at an acute
 angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the
 Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I
 didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of
 the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of
 which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No; I
 should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone. But
 they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity lost,
 if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and then, and
 stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a
 Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with
 theatrical declamation,?as it now appears to me, something like a
 religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,?and
 ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
 Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low reproachful
 voice, "Do you hear that? Be grateful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Especially," said Mr. Pumblechook, "be grateful, boy, to them which
 brought you up by hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful
 presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, "Why is it that the
 young are never grateful?" This moral mystery seemed too much for the
 company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, "Naterally wicious."
 Everybody then murmured "True!" and looked at me in a particularly
 unpleasant and personal manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when
 there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and
 comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so
 at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty
 of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a
 pint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some
 severity, and intimated?in the usual hypothetical case of the Church
 being "thrown open"?what kind of sermon he would have given them.
 After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked that he
 considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which was the less
 excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects "going about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True again," said Uncle Pumblechook. "You've hit it, sir! Plenty of
 subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails.
 That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if he's
 ready with his salt-box." Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of
 reflection, "Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you want a subject,
 look at Pork!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True, sir. Many a moral for the young," returned Mr. Wopsle,?and I
 knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; "might be deduced from
 that text."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("You listen to this," said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe gave me some more gravy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swine," pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork
 at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,?"swine
 were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before
 us, as an example to the young." (I thought this pretty well in him who
 had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) "What is
 detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or girl," suggested Mr. Hubble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble," assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,
 "but there is no girl present."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides," said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, "think what you've
 got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was, if ever a child was," said my sister, most emphatically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe gave me some more gravy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker," said Mr. Pumblechook. "If you
 had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Unless in that form," said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I don't mean in that form, sir," returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an
 objection to being interrupted; "I mean, enjoying himself with his elders
 and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and rolling in
 the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he wouldn't. And
 what would have been your destination?" turning on me again. "You would
 have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price
 of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you
 lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you under his left arm, and
 with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from
 out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have shed your blood and had
 your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a bit of it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was a world of trouble to you, ma'am," said Mrs. Hubble, commiserating
 my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Trouble?" echoed my sister; "trouble?" and then entered on a fearful
 catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of
 sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from,
 and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done
 myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I had
 contumaciously refused to go there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with their
 noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence.
 Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my
 misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he howled. But,
 all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful
 feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued
 upon my sister's recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me
 (as I felt painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet," said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme
 from which they had strayed, "Pork?regarded as biled?is rich,
 too; ain't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have a little brandy, uncle," said my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say it
 was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under the
 cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and
 poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man trifled
 with his glass,?took it up, looked at it through the light, put it
 down,?prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were
 briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I couldn't keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the
 table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his
 glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the
 brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable
 consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several
 times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at
 the door; he then became visible through the window, violently plunging
 and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of
 his mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how I
 had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my dreadful
 situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and surveying the
 company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank down into his
 chair with the one significant gasp, "Tar!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be
 worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by
 the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tar!" cried my sister, in amazement. "Why, how ever could Tar come
 there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't hear
 the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with
 his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had begun to be
 alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in getting the gin
 the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them. For the
 time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the leg of the table,
 but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
 pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding. The
 course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial
 influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over the day,
 when my sister said to Joe, "Clean plates,?cold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my
 bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul. I
 foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must taste," said my sister, addressing the guests with her best
 grace?"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and
 delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook's!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must know," said my sister, rising, "it's a pie; a savory pork pie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of
 having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,?quite
 vivaciously, all things considered,?"Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our
 best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I
 saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the
 Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that "a bit of
 savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no
 harm," and I heard Joe say, "You shall have some, Pip." I have never been
 absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in
 spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I could bear
 no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the table, and
 ran for my life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost
 into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair
 of handcuffs to me, saying, "Here you are, look sharp, come on!"
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 Chapter V
 </h2>
 <p>
 The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their
 loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from
 table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen
 empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of
 "Gracious goodness gracious me, what's gone?with the?pie!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at
 which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the
 sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the
 company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right
 hand, and his left on my shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Excuse me, ladies and gentleman," said the sergeant, "but as I have
 mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver," (which he hadn't), "I
 am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And pray what might you want with him?" retorted my sister, quick to
 resent his being wanted at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Missis," returned the gallant sergeant, "speaking for myself, I should
 reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife's acquaintance; speaking
 for the king, I answer, a little job done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.
 Pumblechook cried audibly, "Good again!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see, blacksmith," said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out
 Joe with his eye, "we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock
 of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty. As they are
 wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would necessitate
 the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two hours than one,
 "Will it? Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith?" said the
 off-hand sergeant, "as it's on his Majesty's service. And if my men can
 bear a hand anywhere, they'll make themselves useful." With that, he
 called to his men, who came trooping into the kitchen one after another,
 and piled their arms in a corner. And then they stood about, as soldiers
 do; now, with their hands loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee
 or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to
 spit stiffly over their high stocks, out into the yard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was in
 an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the handcuffs
 were not for me, and that the military had so far got the better of the
 pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little more of my
 scattered wits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you give me the time?" said the sergeant, addressing himself to Mr.
 Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference
 that he was equal to the time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's just gone half past two."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's not so bad," said the sergeant, reflecting; "even if I was forced
 to halt here nigh two hours, that'll do. How far might you call yourselves
 from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just a mile," said Mrs. Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That'll do. We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk. A little before
 dusk, my orders are. That'll do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Convicts, sergeant?" asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay!" returned the sergeant, "two. They're pretty well known to be out on
 the marshes still, and they won't try to get clear of 'em before dusk.
 Anybody here seen anything of any such game?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of
 me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said the sergeant, "they'll find themselves trapped in a circle, I
 expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you're ready, his
 Majesty the King is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron
 on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden
 windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the
 rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to
 hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
 attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer
 from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass
 of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, "Give him wine, Mum. I'll
 engage there's no Tar in that:" so, the sergeant thanked him and said that
 as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it was
 equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majesty's health
 and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and smacked
 his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good stuff, eh, sergeant?" said Mr. Pumblechook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell you something," returned the sergeant; "I suspect that stuff's
 of your providing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, "Ay, ay? Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because," returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, "you're a
 man that knows what's what."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "D'ye think so?" said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. "Have
 another glass!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With you. Hob and nob," returned the sergeant. "The top of mine to the
 foot of yours,?the foot of yours to the top of mine,?Ring
 once, ring twice,?the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health.
 May you live a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right
 sort than you are at the present moment of your life!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another
 glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to
 forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from
 Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of
 joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine that he
 even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the same
 liberality, when the first was gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,
 enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a
 dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed
 themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened with
 the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively
 anticipation of "the two villains" being taken, and when the bellows
 seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to
 hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and all
 the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose
 and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon
 outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on
 their account, poor wretches.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe
 got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go
 down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook and
 Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies' society; but Mr.
 Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable, and
 would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave to go,
 I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know all about it and how it
 ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, "If you bring the boy back with
 his head blown to bits by a musket, don't look to me to put it together
 again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.
 Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully
 sensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when
 something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in. Mr.
 Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to
 speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in the
 raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably
 whispered to Joe, "I hope, Joe, we shan't find them." and Joe whispered to
 me, "I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold
 and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and
 the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A few faces
 hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out. We
 passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard. There we
 were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's hand, while two
 or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves, and also
 examined the porch. They came in again without finding anything, and then
 we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the
 churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind,
 and Joe took me on his back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought
 I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding, I
 considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should come upon
 them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought
 the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving imp, and he had
 said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him.
 Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and
 had betrayed him?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's
 back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter,
 and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and to keep up
 with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a pretty wide
 line with an interval between man and man. We were taking the course I had
 begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist. Either the mist was
 not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it. Under the low red glare
 of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and
 the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead
 color.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I looked
 all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could hear
 none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his blowing and
 hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and could dissociate
 them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful start, when I thought I
 heard the file still going; but it was only a sheep-bell. The sheep
 stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us; and the cattle, their
 heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared angrily as if they held us
 responsible for both annoyances; but, except these things, and the shudder
 of the dying day in every blade of grass, there was no break in the bleak
 stillness of the marshes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we
 were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all
 stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a
 long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but it
 was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
 together,?if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their
 breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment's listening, Joe (who
 was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge) agreed. The
 sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not be answered,
 but that the course should be changed, and that his men should make
 towards it "at the double." So we slanted to the right (where the East
 was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to
 keep my seat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he
 spoke all the time, "a Winder." Down banks and up banks, and over gates,
 and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared
 where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more
 apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it seemed to
 stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke out again,
 the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them.
 After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one voice calling
 "Murder!" and another voice, "Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the
 runaway convicts!" Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a
 struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had come to this,
 the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two
 of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled
 when we all ran in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here are both men!" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a
 ditch. "Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come
 asunder!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and
 blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to
 help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other
 one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but of
 course I knew them both directly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mind!" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged
 sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: "I took him! I give him
 up to you! Mind that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not much to be particular about," said the sergeant; "it'll do you
 small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more good
 than it does now," said my convict, with a greedy laugh. "I took him. He
 knows it. That's enough for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old
 bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over. He
 could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both
 separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
 falling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take notice, guard,?he tried to murder me," were his first words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tried to murder him?" said my convict, disdainfully. "Try, and not do it?
 I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only prevented him
 getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,?dragged him this
 far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this villain. Now,
 the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder him? Worth my
 while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag him back!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other one still gasped, "He tried?he tried-to?murder me.
 Bear?bear witness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lookee here!" said my convict to the sergeant. "Single-handed I got clear
 of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got clear of
 these death-cold flats likewise?look at my leg: you won't find much
 iron on it?if I hadn't made the discovery that he was here. Let him
 go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a tool
 of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at the bottom
 there," and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled
 hands, "I'd have held to him with that grip, that you should have been
 safe to find him in my hold."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion,
 repeated, "He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead man if you had
 not come up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He lies!" said my convict, with fierce energy. "He's a liar born, and
 he'll die a liar. Look at his face; ain't it written there? Let him turn
 those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,
 collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked
 at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but
 certainly did not look at the speaker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you see him?" pursued my convict. "Do you see what a villain he is? Do
 you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how he looked when we
 were tried together. He never looked at me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
 restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on
 the speaker, with the words, "You are not much to look at," and with a
 half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict became
 so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him but for the
 interposition of the soldiers. "Didn't I tell you," said the other convict
 then, "that he would murder me, if he could?" And any one could see that
 he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his lips curious white
 flakes, like thin snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Enough of this parley," said the sergeant. "Light those torches."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down
 on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,
 and saw me. I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the ditch when
 we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when he
 looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had been
 waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my innocence.
 It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention,
 for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it all passed in a
 moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day, I could not
 have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four
 torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been
 almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very
 dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring,
 fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled at some
 distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the
 river. "All right," said the sergeant. "March."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound
 that seemed to burst something inside my ear. "You are expected on board,"
 said the sergeant to my convict; "they know you are coming. Don't
 straggle, my man. Close up here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard. I
 had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr. Wopsle
 had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so we went on
 with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly on the edge
 of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike came, with a
 miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When I looked round, I
 could see the other lights coming in after us. The torches we carried
 dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and I could see those, too,
 lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing else but black darkness.
 Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two
 prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of
 the muskets. We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they
 were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut and
 a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged, and
 the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was a smell
 of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a stand of
 muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an overgrown mangle
 without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at
 once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great-coats were not
 much interested in us, but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy
 stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some kind of report, and
 some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict
 was drafted off with his guard, to go on board first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the
 hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up
 his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if he
 pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the
 sergeant, and remarked,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some
 persons laying under suspicion alonger me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can say what you like," returned the sergeant, standing coolly
 looking at him with his arms folded, "but you have no call to say it here.
 You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it, before
 it's done with, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't starve;
 at least I can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over yonder,?where
 the church stands a'most out on the marshes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean stole," said the sergeant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa!" said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa, Pip!" said Joe, staring at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was some broken wittles?that's what it was?and a dram of
 liquor, and a pie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?" asked
 the sergeant, confidentially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don't you know, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So," said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and
 without the least glance at me,?"so you're the blacksmith, are you?
 Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God knows you're welcome to it,?so far as it was ever mine,"
 returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. "We don't know what
 you have done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor
 miserable fellow-creatur.?Would us, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat
 again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were
 ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes and
 stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of
 convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested
 in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,
 except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, "Give way, you!"
 which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the torches,
 we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore,
 like a wicked Noah's ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty
 chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the
 prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw him taken up the side
 and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the
 water, and went out, as if it were all over with him.

 Chapter VI
 </h2>
 <p>
 My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so
 unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope
 it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to
 Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I loved
 Joe,?perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because
 the dear fellow let me love him,?and, as to him, my inner self was
 not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when I
 first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the
 whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I
 did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe's
 confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
 staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my
 tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never
 afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker, without
 thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I never
 afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday's meat or
 pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that he was
 debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and at
 any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer
 was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected Tar in it, would bring
 a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I
 knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to
 be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at that time, and I
 imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an
 untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of action for myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took me
 on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome journey
 of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper
 that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have
 excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In his
 lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane
 extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire,
 the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him, if it
 had been a capital offence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
 drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having
 been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
 tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the
 shoulders, and the restorative exclamation "Yah! Was there ever such a boy
 as this!" from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the convict's
 confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had
 got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying
 the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of the forge, and had
 then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let himself down the
 kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr.
 Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise-cart?over
 Everybody?it was agreed that it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed,
 wildly cried out, "No!" with the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he
 had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously set at naught,?not
 to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood with his back to the
 kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire
 confidence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a
 slumberous offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed
 with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be
 dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as I
 have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted long
 after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned saving on
 exceptional occasions.

 <h2>
 Chapter VII
 </h2>
 <p>
 At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones,
 I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My construction
 even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read "wife of the
 Above" as a complimentary reference to my father's exaltation to a better
 world; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as
 "Below," I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that
 member of the family. Neither were my notions of the theological positions
 to which my Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively
 remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to "walk in the same
 all the days of my life," laid me under an obligation always to go through
 the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary
 it by turning down by the wheelwright's or up by the mill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could
 assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called "Pompeyed," or
 (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the
 forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
 birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the
 employment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be
 compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, in
 to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped. I
 have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the
 liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal
 participation in the treasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to
 say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
 infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the
 society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving
 opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.
 Wopsle had the room up stairs, where we students used to overhear him
 reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally
 bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle "examined" the
 scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn up his
 cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony's oration over the body
 of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins's Ode on the Passions,
 wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his
 blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet
 with a withering look. It was not with me then, as it was in later life,
 when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with
 Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,
 kept in the same room?a little general shop. She had no idea what
 stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a
 little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a
 Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop
 transaction. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess
 myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she
 was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been
 brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her
 extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted
 washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. This
 description must be received with a week-day limitation. On Sundays, she
 went to church elaborated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.
 Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a
 bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter.
 After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who seemed every
 evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition.
 But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and
 cipher, on the very smallest scale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending
 great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have
 been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time
 after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the hearth
 at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear
 this epistle:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "MI DEER JO i OPE U R KR WITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE U
 JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN BLEVE
 ME INF XN PIP."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by
 letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered
 this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe
 received it as a miracle of erudition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I say, Pip, old chap!" cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, "what a
 scholar you are! An't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like to be," said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with a
 misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, here's a J," said Joe, "and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and a
 O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
 monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I
 accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his
 convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to embrace
 the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I should have
 to begin quite at the beginning, I said, "Ah! But read the rest, Jo."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The rest, eh, Pip?" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,
 "One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Joes
 in it, Pip!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole
 letter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Astonishing!" said Joe, when I had finished. "You ARE a scholar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you spell Gargery, Joe?" I asked him, with a modest patronage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't spell it at all," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But supposing you did?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It can't be supposed," said Joe. "Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,
 too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you, Joe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On-common. Give me," said Joe, "a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit
 me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!" he continued, after
 rubbing his knees a little, "when you do come to a J and a O, and says
 you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting reading is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its
 infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Pip," said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his
 usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between
 the lower bars; "I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given to drink,
 and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my mother, most
 onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did, indeed, 'xcepting at
 myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the
 wigor with which he didn't hammer at his anwil.?You're a listening
 and understanding, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several times;
 and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, "Joe," she'd say,
 "now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child," and she'd put me
 to school. But my father were that good in his hart that he couldn't abear
 to be without us. So, he'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such
 a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that they used to be
 obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him. And then
 he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see, Pip," said Joe, pausing
 in his meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, "were a drawback
 on my learning."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly, poor Joe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Though mind you, Pip," said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the
 poker on the top bar, "rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining equal
 justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart, don't
 you see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I didn't see; but I didn't say so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" Joe pursued, "somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the pot
 won't bile, don't you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I saw that, and said so.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so I
 went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would have
 followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip. In time I
 were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a purple leptic
 fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that,
 Whatsume'er the failings on his part, Remember reader he were that good in
 his heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity,
 that I asked him if he had made it himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I made it," said Joe, "my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like
 striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much
 surprised in all my life,?couldn't credit my own ed,?to tell
 you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it
 were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money,
 cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention
 bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother. She
 were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren't long of following, poor
 soul, and her share of peace come round at last."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and
 then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the
 round knob on the top of the poker.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It were but lonesome then," said Joe, "living here alone, and I got
 acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,"?Joe looked firmly at me as
 if he knew I was not going to agree with him;?"your sister is a fine
 figure of a woman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that
 subject may be, Pip, your sister is," Joe tapped the top bar with the
 poker after every word following, "a-fine-figure?of?a?woman!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could think of nothing better to say than "I am glad you think so, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So am I," returned Joe, catching me up. "I am glad I think so, Pip. A
 little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it
 signify to Me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him, to whom did it
 signify?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly!" assented Joe. "That's it. You're right, old chap! When I got
 acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing you up
 by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said, along with
 all the folks. As to you," Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of
 seeing something very nasty indeed, "if you could have been aware how
 small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have formed the most
 contemptible opinion of yourself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not exactly relishing this, I said, "Never mind me, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I did mind you, Pip," he returned with tender simplicity. "When I
 offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at such
 times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to her,
 'And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,' I said
 to your sister, 'there's room for him at the forge!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck: who
 dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, "Ever the best of friends; an't
 us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights; here
 we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you
 beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't see too
 much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly. And
 why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have
 proceeded in his demonstration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your sister is given to government."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Given to government, Joe?" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea
 (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor of
 the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Given to government," said Joe. "Which I meantersay the government of you
 and myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises," Joe
 continued, "and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
 scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as "Why?"
 when Joe stopped me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stay a bit. I know what you're a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don't
 deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don't
 deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us
 heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip," Joe
 sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, "candor compels fur
 to admit that she is a Buster."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might feel
 his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid
 occupation; "your sister's a master-mind. A master-mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that?" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But Joe
 was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely
 stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look, "Her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I ain't a master-mind," Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,
 and got back to his whisker. "And last of all, Pip,?and this I want
 to say very serious to you, old chap,?I see so much in my poor
 mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and
 never getting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going
 wrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur rather
 of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced
 myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't
 no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but
 this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll
 overlook shortcomings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that
 night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards
 at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had a
 new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my
 heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "However," said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; "here's the Dutch-clock
 a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em, and she's not
 come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't have set a forefoot
 on a piece o' ice, and gone down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days, to
 assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman's
 judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences
 in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out on one
 of these expeditions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to
 listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew
 keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of
 lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and
 considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as
 he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering
 multitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here comes the mare," said Joe, "ringing like a peal of bells!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she
 came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready
 for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a
 bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
 be out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they drove
 up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle Pumblechook
 was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in
 the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive
 all the heat out of the fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and
 throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,
 "if this boy ain't grateful this night, he never will be!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly uninformed
 why he ought to assume that expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's only to be hoped," said my sister, "that he won't be Pompeyed. But I
 have my fears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She ain't in that line, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "She knows better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, "She?"
 Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows, "She?" My
 sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand across his
 nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" said my sister, in her snappish way. "What are you staring at? Is
 the house afire?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?Which some individual," Joe politely hinted, "mentioned?she."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she is a she, I suppose?" said my sister. "Unless you call Miss
 Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham, up town?" said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is there any Miss Havisham down town?" returned my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he's going. And he
 had better play there," said my sister, shaking her head at me as an
 encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, "or I'll work him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,?everybody for miles round had
 heard of Miss Havisham up town,?as an immensely rich and grim lady
 who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who
 led a life of seclusion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well to be sure!" said Joe, astounded. "I wonder how she come to know
 Pip!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Noodle!" cried my sister. "Who said she knew him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?Which some individual," Joe again politely hinted, "mentioned that
 she wanted him to go and play there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And couldn't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play
 there? Isn't it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be a
 tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes?we won't say quarterly or
 half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you?but
 sometimes?go there to pay his rent? And couldn't she then ask Uncle
 Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn't Uncle
 Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us?though
 you may not think it, Joseph," in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he
 were the most callous of nephews, "then mention this boy, standing
 Prancing here"?which I solemnly declare I was not doing?"that
 I have for ever been a willing slave to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good again!" cried Uncle Pumblechook. "Well put! Prettily pointed! Good
 indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Joseph," said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe
 apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose, "you
 do not yet?though you may not think it?know the case. You may
 consider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that
 Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this
 boy's fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham's, has offered to
 take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep him
 to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham's to-morrow
 morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!" cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in
 sudden desperation, "here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs, with Uncle
 Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door, and the boy
 grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his
 foot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was
 squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of
 water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped, and
 harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I may here
 remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living
 authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing
 unsympathetically over the human countenance.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the
 stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was trussed
 up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered over to Mr.
 Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff, and who
 let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all
 along: "Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them
 which brought you up by hand!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, Joe!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God bless you, Pip, old chap!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what
 with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But
 they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the questions
 why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and what on earth I
 was expected to play at.

 <h2>
 Chapter VIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook's premises in the High Street of the market town, were of
 a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a cornchandler
 and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man
 indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and I wondered when I
 peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper
 packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine
 day to break out of those jails, and bloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this
 speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in an
 attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the
 bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
 eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity
 between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did
 his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the
 corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor
 about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew
 which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.
 Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street
 at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye
 on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in
 his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded his arms
 and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist.
 The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass
 at his eye, and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over
 him through the glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only
 person in the High Street whose trade engaged his attention.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind
 the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and
 butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.
 Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister's idea
 that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my
 diet,?besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
 with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into my
 milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
 altogether,?his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On
 my politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, "Seven times
 nine, boy?" And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in a
 strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had
 swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the
 breakfast. "Seven?" "And four?" "And eight?" "And six?" "And two?" "And
 ten?" And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much as
 I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat at
 his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be
 allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started for
 Miss Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner
 in which I should acquit myself under that lady's roof. Within a quarter
 of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old brick, and
 dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the windows had been
 walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were rustily barred.
 There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so we had to wait,
 after ringing the bell, until some one should come to open it. While we
 waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr. Pumblechook said, "And
 fourteen?" but I pretended not to hear him), and saw that at the side of
 the house there was a large brewery. No brewing was going on in it, and
 none seemed to have gone on for a long long time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded "What name?" To which my
 conductor replied, "Pumblechook." The voice returned, "Quite right," and
 the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,
 with keys in her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This," said Mr. Pumblechook, "is Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is Pip, is it?" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and
 seemed very proud; "come in, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" she said. "Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Miss Havisham wished to see me," returned Mr. Pumblechook,
 discomfited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said the girl; "but you see she don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.
 Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest.
 But he eyed me severely,?as if I had done anything to him!?and
 departed with the words reproachfully delivered: "Boy! Let your behavior
 here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!" I was not free
 from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate,
 "And sixteen?" But he didn't.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard. It
 was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The brewery
 buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the wooden gates
 of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood open, away to
 the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused. The cold wind
 seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it made a shrill
 noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery, like the
 noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She saw me looking at it, and she said, "You could drink without hurt all
 the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think I could, miss," said I, in a shy way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;
 don't you think so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It looks like it, miss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not that anybody means to try," she added, "for that's all done with, and
 the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong beer,
 there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor House."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that the name of this house, miss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One of its names, boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It has more than one, then, miss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew,
 or all three?or all one to me?for enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Enough House," said I; "that's a curious name, miss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she replied; "but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it was
 given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They must have
 been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don't loiter,
 boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Though she called me "boy" so often, and with a carelessness that was far
 from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much older
 than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed; and she
 was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a queen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two
 chains across it outside,?and the first thing I noticed was, that
 the passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.
 She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and
 still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, "Go in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I answered, more in shyness than politeness, "After you, miss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this she returned: "Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in." And
 scornfully walked away, and?what was worse?took the candle
 with her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only
 thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from
 within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large
 room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to be seen
 in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though
 much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But prominent
 in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out
 at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
 fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow
 resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest
 lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was dressed in rich materials,?satins, and lace, and silks,?all
 of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent
 from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was
 white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some
 other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the
 dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. She had not
 quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,?the other was
 on the table near her hand,?her veil was but half arranged, her
 watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with
 those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers,
 and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I
 saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw
 that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white
 long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the
 bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the
 flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes.
 I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young
 woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin
 and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair,
 representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I
 had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the
 ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church
 pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved
 and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is it?" said the lady at the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come?to play."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the
 surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at
 twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty
 minutes to nine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has
 never seen the sun since you were born?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
 comprehended in the answer "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands, one upon the
 other, on her left side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am." (It made me think of the young man.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do I touch?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Broken!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and
 with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept her
 hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were
 heavy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done with
 men and women. Play."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could
 hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world
 more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I sometimes have sick fancies," she went on, "and I have a sick fancy
 that I want to see some play. There, there!" with an impatient movement of
 the fingers of her right hand; "play, play, play!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I
 had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
 of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the
 performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what
 I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had
 taken a good look at each other,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you sullen and obstinate?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just now.
 If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so I would
 do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so fine,?and
 melancholy?." I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had
 already said it, and we took another look at each other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the
 dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the
 looking-glass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So new to him," she muttered, "so old to me; so strange to him, so
 familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was
 still talking to herself, and kept quiet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Call Estella," she repeated, flashing a look at me. "You can do that.
 Call Estella. At the door."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling
 Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive, and
 feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost as bad
 as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came along
 the dark passage like a star.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the
 table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
 pretty brown hair. "Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well.
 Let me see you play cards with this boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,?only it seemed so
 unlikely,?"Well? You can break his heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you play, boy?" asked Estella of myself, with the greatest
 disdain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Beggar him," said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped,
 like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that Miss
 Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken
 it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table again,
 and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never been
 worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent, and saw
 that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been trodden
 ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the
 pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed
 form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a
 shroud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and
 trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing
 then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
 ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
 seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if the
 admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!" said Estella with disdain, before
 our first game was out. "And what coarse hands he has! And what thick
 boots!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to
 consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so strong,
 that it became infectious, and I caught it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I
 knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for a
 stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You say nothing of her," remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked on.
 "She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What do you
 think of her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't like to say," I stammered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me in my ear," said Miss Havisham, bending down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she is very proud," I replied, in a whisper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything else?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she is very pretty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything else?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think she is very insulting." (She was looking at me then with a look
 of supreme aversion.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything else?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I should like to go home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And never see her again, though she is so pretty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should like
 to go home now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shall go soon," said Miss Havisham, aloud. "Play the game out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure
 that Miss Havisham's face could not smile. It had dropped into a watchful
 and brooding expression,?most likely when all the things about her
 had become transfixed,?and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
 it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice had
 dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her; altogether,
 she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul, within and
 without, under the weight of a crushing blow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She threw
 the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she despised
 them for having been won of me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When shall I have you here again?" said Miss Havisham. "Let me think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she checked
 me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of weeks
 of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam
 and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she stood
 it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side entrance,
 I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be
 night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel
 as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are to wait here, you boy," said Estella; and disappeared and closed
 the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
 coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was not
 favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me now, as
 vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to
 call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called knaves. I wished
 Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been
 so too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She put
 the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat
 without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace. I was
 so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,?I cannot hit
 upon the right name for the smart?God knows what its name was,?that
 tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the girl looked at
 me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them. This gave me
 power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a contemptuous
 toss?but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was
 so wounded?and left me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in,
 and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve
 against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried. As I
 cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so bitter were
 my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that needed
 counteraction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in
 which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is
 nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be
 only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is
 small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many hands
 high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within myself, I
 had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. I
 had known, from the time when I could speak, that my sister, in her
 capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had cherished a
 profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to
 bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces, fasts, and
 vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed this assurance;
 and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and unprotected way, I
 in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
 brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my
 face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat
 were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon in
 spirits to look about me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the
 brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind,
 and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there had been
 any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons in the
 dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in the
 storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat. All the
 uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of
 smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks, which had a
 certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them; but it was
 too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone,?and
 in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old
 wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to
 look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house,
 and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was a track
 upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked there,
 and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she seemed to be
 everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks,
 and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at the end of the
 yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her pretty brown hair
 spread out in her two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my
 view directly. So, in the brewery itself,?by which I mean the large
 paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer, and where the
 brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it, and, rather
 oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about me, I saw her
 pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron stairs, and
 go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going out into the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened to
 my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a stranger
 thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes?a little dimmed by looking
 up at the frosty light?towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of
 the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by
 the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet; and
 it hung so, that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were
 like earthy paper, and that the face was Miss Havisham's, with a movement
 going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me. In
 the terror of seeing the figure, and in the terror of being certain that
 it had not been there a moment before, I at first ran from it, and then
 ran towards it. And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure
 there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of
 people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving
 influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought
 me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon as
 I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let me out.
 She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I thought, if
 she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that my
 hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the gate,
 and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her, when she
 touched me with a taunting hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you cry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I don't want to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do," said she. "You have been crying till you are half blind, and you
 are near crying again now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me. I
 went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to find him
 not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at
 Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge;
 pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I
 was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were
 thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks;
 that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and
 generally that I was in a low-lived bad way.

 <h2>
 Chapter IX
 </h2>
 <p>
 When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss
 Havisham's, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself
 getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
 of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
 wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young
 people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine,?which
 I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of
 having been a monstrosity,?it is the key to many reservations. I
 felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my eyes had seen it,
 I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss
 Havisham too would not be understood; and although she was perfectly
 incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be
 something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was (to
 say nothing of Miss Estella) before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.
 Consequently, I said as little as I could, and had my face shoved against
 the kitchen wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by a
 devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came
 gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged
 to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth
 open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving with
 windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, boy," Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the
 chair of honor by the fire. "How did you get on up town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I answered, "Pretty well, sir," and my sister shook her fist at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pretty well?" Mr. Pumblechook repeated. "Pretty well is no answer. Tell
 us what you mean by pretty well, boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
 perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my obstinacy
 was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had
 discovered a new idea, "I mean pretty well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,?I
 had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,?when Mr.
 Pumblechook interposed with "No! Don't lose your temper. Leave this lad to
 me, ma'am; leave this lad to me." Mr. Pumblechook then turned me towards
 him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I calculated the consequences of replying "Four Hundred Pound," and
 finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could?which
 was somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my
 pence-table from "twelve pence make one shilling," up to "forty pence make
 three and fourpence," and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had done
 for me, "Now! How much is forty-three pence?" To which I replied, after a
 long interval of reflection, "I don't know." And I was so aggravated that
 I almost doubt if I did know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and
 said, "Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for
 instance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes!" said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was
 highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and
 brought him to a dead stop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?" Mr. Pumblechook began again when he had
 recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very tall and dark," I told him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is she, uncle?" asked my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had
 never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good!" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. ("This is the way to have him!
 We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?")
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am sure, uncle," returned Mrs. Joe, "I wish you had him always; you
 know so well how to deal with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?" asked Mr.
 Pumblechook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She was sitting," I answered, "in a black velvet coach."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another?as they well
 might?and both repeated, "In a black velvet coach?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said I. "And Miss Estella?that's her niece, I think?handed
 her in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had
 cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,
 because she told me to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was anybody else there?" asked Mr. Pumblechook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Four dogs," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Large or small?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Immense," said I. "And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver
 basket."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter
 amazement. I was perfectly frantic,?a reckless witness under the
 torture,?and would have told them anything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?" asked my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In Miss Havisham's room." They stared again. "But there weren't any
 horses to it." I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting four
 richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can this be possible, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe. "What can the boy mean?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell you, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "My opinion is, it's a
 sedan-chair. She's flighty, you know,?very flighty,?quite
 flighty enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you ever see her in it, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How could I," he returned, forced to the admission, "when I never see her
 in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, don't you know," said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, "that when I have
 been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door
 has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you don't know
 that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play at,
 boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We played with flags," I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself
 with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Flags!" echoed my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said I. "Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Miss
 Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the
 coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swords!" repeated my sister. "Where did you get swords from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Out of a cupboard," said I. "And I saw pistols in it,?and jam,?and
 pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up
 with candles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's true, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. "That's the
 state of the case, for that much I've seen myself." And then they both
 stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
 countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers with
 my right hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have
 betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there
 was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement but for
 my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the
 brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the marvels I
 had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped. The subject
 still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea. To
 whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for the
 gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen
 in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded
 him,?not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards Joe, and
 Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating
 what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's acquaintance and favor.
 They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would "do something" for me; their
 doubts related to the form that something would take. My sister stood out
 for "property." Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for
 binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,?say, the corn and seed
 trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for
 offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of
 the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets. "If a fool's head can't
 express better opinions than that," said my sister, "and you have got any
 work to do, you had better go and do it." So he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up, I
 stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for the
 night. Then I said, "Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to tell
 you something."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Should you, Pip?" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.
 "Then tell us. What is it, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Joe," said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it
 between my finger and thumb, "you remember all that about Miss
 Havisham's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Remember?" said Joe. "I believe you! Wonderful!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What are you telling of, Pip?" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest
 amazement. "You don't mean to say it's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes I do; it's lies, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was no
 black welwet co?ch?" For, I stood shaking my head. "But at least
 there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip," said Joe, persuasively, "if there warn't
 no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A dog?" said Joe. "A puppy? Come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay. "Pip,
 old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to go to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Terrible?" cried Joe. "Awful! What possessed you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what possessed me, Joe," I replied, letting his shirt sleeve
 go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head; "but I
 wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my
 boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been
 able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to
 me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's who
 was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew
 I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had
 come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal with
 as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of
 metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip," said Joe, after some
 rumination, "namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't
 ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to
 the same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. That ain't the way to get
 out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make it out
 at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon small.
 Likewise you're a oncommon scholar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've
 seen letters?Ah! and from gentlefolks!?that I'll swear weren't
 wrote in print," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only
 that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Pip," said Joe, "be it so or be it son't, you must be a common
 scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon his
 throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of
 Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted
 Prince, with the alphabet.?Ah!" added Joe, with a shake of the head
 that was full of meaning, "and begun at A. too, and worked his way to Z.
 And I know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whether common ones as to callings and earnings," pursued Joe,
 reflectively, "mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company
 with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon ones,?which
 reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or mightn't
 be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting your sister on
 the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as being done
 intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a true friend.
 Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to be oncommon
 through going straight, you'll never get to do it through going crooked.
 So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die happy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are not angry with me, Joe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a
 stunning and outdacious sort,?alluding to them which bordered on
 weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,?a sincere well-wisher would adwise,
 Pip, their being dropped into your meditations, when you go up stairs to
 bed. That's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget
 Joe's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
 unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common
 Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and
 how coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in
 the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Miss
 Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level
 of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I "used to do" when I
 was at Miss Havisham's; as though I had been there weeks or months,
 instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of
 remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is
 the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and
 think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this,
 and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or
 flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the
 first link on one memorable day.

 <h2>
 Chapter X
 </h2>
 <p>
 The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,
 that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get
 out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous conception
 I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's at night,
 that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I
 should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning
 to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls, immediately said she
 would, and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt
 may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and put
 straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt collected
 her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod.
 After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed
 in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand. The book had
 an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling,?that
 is to say, it had had once. As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr.
 Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of coma, arising either from sleep
 or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then entered among themselves upon a
 competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of
 ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes. This mental
 exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three
 defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump
 end of something), more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities
 of literature I have since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and
 having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves.
 This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats
 between Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy
 gave out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,?or
 what we couldn't?in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,
 shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or
 reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had
 lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who
 staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood
 to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with
 shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no
 prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with a slate or even
 with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that
 branch of study in the winter season, on account of the little general
 shop in which the classes were holden?and which was also Mr.
 Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber?being but faintly
 illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no
 snuffers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under these
 circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very evening
 Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from
 her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending
 me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she had imitated from the
 heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed, until she told me what it
 was, to be a design for a buckle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked
 sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders from my
 sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that evening, on my
 way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the Three Jolly
 Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk
 scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be
 never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and had
 grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our
 country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to
 account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at
 these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I merely
 wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the
 passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Joe was
 smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger. Joe greeted me
 as usual with "Halloa, Pip, old chap!" and the moment he said that, the
 stranger turned his head and looked at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was all
 on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were taking
 aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his mouth, and he
 took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard
 at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he nodded again, and
 made room on the settle beside him that I might sit down there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
 resort, I said "No, thank you, sir," and fell into the space Joe made for
 me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and
 seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I
 had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg?in a very odd way, as it
 struck me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You was saying," said the strange man, turning to Joe, "that you was a
 blacksmith."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I said it, you know," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'll you drink, Mr.?? You didn't mention your name, by the bye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. "What'll you
 drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, "to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of
 drinking at anybody's expense but my own."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Habit? No," returned the stranger, "but once and away, and on a Saturday
 night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wouldn't wish to be stiff company," said Joe. "Rum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rum," repeated the stranger. "And will the other gentleman originate a
 sentiment."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rum," said Mr. Wopsle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three Rums!" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. "Glasses
 round!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This other gentleman," observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,
 "is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at
 church."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aha!" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. "The lonely
 church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's it," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his legs
 up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping broad-brimmed
 traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the
 manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he looked at the fire, I
 thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into
 his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary
 country towards the river."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Most marshes is solitary," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants
 of any sort, out there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Joe; "none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't
 find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but
 not warmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seems you have been out after such?" asked the stranger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Once," returned Joe. "Not that we wanted to take them, you understand; we
 went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger looked at me again,?still cocking his eye, as if he
 were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,?and said,
 "He's a likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Christened Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, not christened Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Surname Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Joe, "it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
 infant, and is called by."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Son of yours?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in
 anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the
 Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
 discussed over pipes,?"well?no. No, he ain't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nevvy?" said the strange man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, "he is
 not?no, not to deceive you, he is not?my nevvy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What the Blue Blazes is he?" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me to
 be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,
 having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
 might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having his
 hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage
 from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite enough to
 account for it when he added, "?as the poet says."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered
 it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
 my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at
 our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process
 under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in
 my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle, but
 some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at me
 as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me down.
 But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation, until the
 glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his shot, and a
 most extraordinary shot it was.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was
 pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,
 and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and he
 tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it he
 wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's file,
 and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument. I sat
 gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on his settle, taking very
 little notice of me, and talking principally about turnips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before
 going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which
 stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than
 at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out together,
 Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery," said the strange man. "I think I've got
 a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy shall
 have it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
 crumpled paper, and gave it to me. "Yours!" said he. "Mind! Your own."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners, and
 holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle
 good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his
 aiming eye,?no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be
 done with an eye by hiding it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have
 been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the
 Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open, to
 rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a manner
 stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance, and
 could think of nothing else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the
 kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her
 about the bright shilling. "A bad un, I'll be bound," said Mrs. Joe
 triumphantly, "or he wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's look at it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. "But what's
 this?" said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the
 paper. "Two One-Pound notes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have
 been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in the
 county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly
 Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down on
 my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that
 the man would not be there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he, Joe,
 had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes. Then my
 sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under some dried
 rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state
 parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many a night and
 day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the
 strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily
 coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
 convicts,?a feature in my low career that I had previously
 forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I
 least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by
 thinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the
 file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I
 screamed myself awake.

 <h2>
 Chapter XI
 </h2>
 <p>
 At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating
 ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me, as
 she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage where her
 candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the candle in her
 hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously saying, "You are
 to come this way to-day," and took me to quite another part of the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square
 basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,
 however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and
 opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a
 small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a detached
 dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or
 head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the outer wall of
 this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and like Miss
 Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a
 low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in
 the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, "You are to go and
 stand there boy, till you are wanted." "There", being the window, I
 crossed to it, and stood "there," in a very uncomfortable state of mind,
 looking out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the
 neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree
 that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth
 at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part
 of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This was my homely
 thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been some light snow,
 overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite
 melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it
 up in little eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for
 coming there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that
 its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room
 except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all
 my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been
 standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they
 were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know
 that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he or
 she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure, and
 the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a
 yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded me of my
 sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found when I
 caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when I knew
 her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features at all, so
 very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor dear soul!" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my
 sister's. "Nobody's enemy but his own!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy," said the
 gentleman; "far more natural."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cousin Raymond," observed another lady, "we are to love our neighbor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sarah Pocket," returned Cousin Raymond, "if a man is not his own
 neighbor, who is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn), "The
 idea!" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too. The
 other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, "Very
 true!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor soul!" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking
 at me in the mean time), "he is so very strange! Would anyone believe that
 when Tom's wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the
 importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to their
 mourning? 'Good Lord!' says he, 'Camilla, what can it signify so long as
 the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew! The idea!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good points in him, good points in him," said Cousin Raymond; "Heaven
 forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never
 will have, any sense of the proprieties."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know I was obliged," said Camilla,?"I was obliged to be firm. I
 said, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,
 without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from
 breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out in
 his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank Goodness
 it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in
 a pouring rain and bought the things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He paid for them, did he not?" asked Estella.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them," returned
 Camilla. "I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace, when
 I wake up in the night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or
 call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation
 and caused Estella to say to me, "Now, boy!" On my turning round, they all
 looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sarah
 Pocket say, "Well I am sure! What next!" and Camilla add, with
 indignation, "Was there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped
 all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with her
 face quite close to mine,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, miss?" I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Am I pretty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; I think you are very pretty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Am I insulting?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not so much so as you were last time," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not so much so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with
 such force as she had, when I answered it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now?" said she. "You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall not tell you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because you are going to tell up stairs. Is that it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said I, "that's not it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why don't you cry again, you little wretch?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I'll never cry for you again," said I. Which was, I suppose, as
 false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her
 then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went on our way up stairs after this episode; and, as we were going up,
 we met a gentleman groping his way down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whom have we here?" asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A boy," said Estella.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an exceedingly
 large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin in his large
 hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the
 candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and had bushy
 black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling. His eyes
 were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and
 suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his
 beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing to
 me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be anything
 to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?" said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you come here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham sent for me, sir," I explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and
 you're a bad set of fellows. Now mind!" said he, biting the side of his
 great forefinger as he frowned at me, "you behave yourself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With those words, he released me?which I was glad of, for his hand
 smelt of scented soap?and went his way down stairs. I wondered
 whether he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn't be a doctor,
 or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much
 time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room,
 where she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left
 me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her
 eyes upon me from the dressing-table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So!" she said, without being startled or surprised: "the days have worn
 away, have they?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am. To-day is?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there, there!" with the impatient movement of her fingers. "I
 don't want to know. Are you ready to play?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was obliged to answer in some confusion, "I don't think I am, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at cards again?" she demanded, with a searching look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy," said Miss Havisham,
 impatiently, "and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to
 find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then go into that opposite room," said she, pointing at the door behind
 me with her withered hand, "and wait there till I come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated. From
 that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an
 airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in the
 damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than to burn
 up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the
 clearer air,?like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches of
 candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it would
 be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was spacious,
 and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it
 was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The most
 prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it, as if a
 feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped
 together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of
 this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was
 quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of
 which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw
 speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running
 out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance
 had just transpired in the spider community.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same
 occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took
 no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
 elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on
 terms with one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching them
 from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder. In her
 other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and she
 looked like the Witch of the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This," said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, "is where I
 will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there
 and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the
 Fair, I shrank under her touch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you think that is?" she asked me, again pointing with her stick;
 "that, where those cobwebs are?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't guess what it is, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning
 on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, "Come, come, come! Walk me,
 walk me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham
 round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and she leaned
 upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an
 imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.
 Pumblechook's chaise-cart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, "Slower!"
 Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she twitched
 the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to believe
 that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a while she
 said, "Call Estella!" so I went out on the landing and roared that name as
 I had done on the previous occasion. When her light appeared, I returned
 to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should
 have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the three
 ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know what to do.
 In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham twitched my
 shoulder, and we posted on,?with a shame-faced consciousness on my
 part that they would think it was all my doing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear Miss Havisham," said Miss Sarah Pocket. "How well you look!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do not," returned Miss Havisham. "I am yellow skin and bone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she
 murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, "Poor dear soul!
 Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how are you?" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to
 Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss
 Havisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly
 obnoxious to Camilla.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Miss Havisham," she returned, "I am as well as can be
 expected."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what's the matter with you?" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding
 sharpness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing worth mentioning," replied Camilla. "I don't wish to make a
 display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the
 night than I am quite equal to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then don't think of me," retorted Miss Havisham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very easily said!" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a
 hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. "Raymond is a
 witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.
 Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings and
 nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety
 of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should
 have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I wish it
 could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night?The idea!"
 Here, a burst of tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and him
 I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point, and
 said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, "Camilla, my dear, it is
 well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the
 extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am not aware," observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but
 once, "that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
 person, my dear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated
 old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,
 and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this
 position by saying, "No, indeed, my dear. Hem!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thinking is easy enough," said the grave lady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is easier, you know?" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes, yes!" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise
 from her legs to her bosom. "It's all very true! It's a weakness to be so
 affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be much better
 if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition if I could.
 It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to know I posses
 it, when I wake up in the night." Here another burst of feeling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going round
 and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the visitors, now
 giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's Matthew!" said Camilla. "Never mixing with any natural ties,
 never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa
 with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head
 over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don't know where?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("Much higher than your head, my love," said Mr. Camilla.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of Matthew's
 strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really I must say I should think not!" interposed the grave lady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see, my dear," added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious personage),
 "the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to thank you, my
 love?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort," resumed Camilla,
 "I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond is a witness
 of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total inefficacy of
 ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner's across
 the street, where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be
 pigeons cooing at a distance,?and now to be told?" Here
 Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical as to
 the formation of new combinations there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and
 herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great
 influence in bringing Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Matthew will come and see me at last," said Miss Havisham, sternly, "when
 I am laid on that table. That will be his place,?there," striking
 the table with her stick, "at my head! And yours will be there! And your
 husband's there! And Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now you
 all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me. And
 now go!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in a
 new place. She now said, "Walk me, walk me!" and we went on again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose there's nothing to be done," exclaimed Camilla, "but comply and
 depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and duty for
 even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction
 when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but
 he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a display of my
 feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one's
 relations,?as if one was a Giant,?and to be told to go. The
 bare idea!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
 bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed
 to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and
 kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah Pocket and
 Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to
 be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that
 the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah Pocket then made her
 separate effect of departing with, "Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!" and
 with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell countenance for the
 weaknesses of the rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked with
 her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she stopped
 before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is my birthday, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here
 just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they
 dare not refer to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of decay,"
 stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table, but
 not touching it, "was brought here. It and I have worn away together. The
 mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed
 at me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at
 the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the once
 white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state to
 crumble under a touch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When the ruin is complete," said she, with a ghastly look, "and when they
 lay me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,?which shall
 be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,?so much the
 better if it is done on this day!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
 lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained
 quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In the
 heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter
 corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently
 begin to decay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an
 instant, Miss Havisham said, "Let me see you two play cards; why have you
 not begun?" With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as before; I
 was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham watched us
 all the time, directed my attention to Estella's beauty, and made me
 notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella's breast and hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she did
 not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games, a day
 was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard to be fed
 in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to wander
 about as I liked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I
 had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last
 occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one
 now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors
 out,?for she had returned with the keys in her hand,?I
 strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a
 wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,
 which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
 weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy
 offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a
 fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal
 corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for a
 moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and
 found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale
 young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
 He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I now
 saw that he was inky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa!" said he, "young fellow!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best
 answered by itself, I said, "Halloa!" politely omitting young fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who let you in?" said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Estella."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who gave you leave to prowl about?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Estella."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come and fight," said the pale young gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question
 since; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so
 astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a spell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop a minute, though," he said, wheeling round before we had gone many
 paces. "I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!" In a
 most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another,
 daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair, slapped his
 hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was
 unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly
 disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out at him and was
 going to hit out again, when he said, "Aha! Would you?" and began dancing
 backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited
 experience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laws of the game!" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to his
 right. "Regular rules!" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to his
 left. "Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!" Here, he
 dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I looked
 helplessly at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt
 morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
 had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to
 consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I
 followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by
 the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me
 if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my
 leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle
 of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. "Available for both," he said,
 placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not only his
 jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once
 light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Although he did not look very healthy,?having pimples on his face,
 and a breaking out at his mouth,?these dreadful preparations quite
 appalled me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller,
 and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance.
 For the rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded
 for battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in
 advance of the rest of him as to development.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every demonstration
 of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely
 choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was
 when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back, looking up
 at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore-shortened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a great
 show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest surprise I
 have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at
 me out of a black eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no strength,
 and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down; but he
 would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out of the
 water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
 according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me
 believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily bruised,
 for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I hit him;
 but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got a bad fall
 with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that crisis in our
 affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times, not
 knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw
 it up: at the same time panting out, "That means you have won."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the
 contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go so
 far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of
 savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly
 wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, "Can I help you?" and
 he said "No thankee," and I said "Good afternoon," and he said "Same to
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys. But
 she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her waiting; and
 there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something had happened
 to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she stepped
 back into the passage, and beckoned me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come here! You may kiss me, if you like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone
 through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was given
 to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that it
 was worth nothing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with
 the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light
 on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a
 black night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the
 road.
 </p><br>
 <p>

 <h2>
 Chapter XII
 </h2>
 <p>
 My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The
 more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on his
 back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more
 certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that the
 pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would avenge
 it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it
 was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country,
 ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of
 England, without laying themselves open to severe punishment. For some
 days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen door with
 the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand, lest the
 officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young
 gentleman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried to wash out that
 evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against
 the pale young gentleman's teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a
 thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that
 damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
 violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,
 specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the gate;?whether
 Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done
 to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol,
 and shoot me dead:?whether suborned boys?a numerous band of
 mercenaries?might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and
 cuff me until I was no more;?it was high testimony to my confidence
 in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him
 accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the acts
 of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his visage and
 an indignant sympathy with the family features.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing
 came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale
 young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same
 gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows of
 the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
 shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where the combat
 had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman's
 existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I covered them
 with garden-mould from the eye of man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other room
 in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,?a light
 chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed there
 since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular occupation
 of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with
 her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing, and
 round the other room. Over and over and over again, we would make these
 journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a
 stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as
 numerous, because it was at once settled that I should return every
 alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am now going to
 sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to
 me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going
 to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I
 enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the
 hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end. But she
 did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither
 did she ever give me any money,?or anything but my daily dinner,?nor
 ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me
 I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;
 sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite
 familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she
 hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were
 alone, "Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?" And when I said yes
 (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we
 played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of
 Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so
 many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or
 do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring
 something in her ear that sounded like "Break their hearts my pride and
 hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the
 burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
 homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation
 towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
 iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's
 respected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round?Old Clem! With a
 thump and a sound?Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out?Old Clem!
 With a clink for the stout?Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire?Old
 Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher?Old Clem! One day soon after the
 appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
 impatient movement of her fingers, "There, there, there! Sing!" I was
 surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It
 happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice
 as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became customary with
 us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often join in; though
 the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were three of us, that it
 made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail
 to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
 dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the
 misty yellow rooms?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had not
 previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had
 confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to
 discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put
 into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him. Besides,
 that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed, which had
 come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time went on. I
 reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy
 everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep
 concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though I think I
 know now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost
 insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass, Pumblechook,
 used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my
 prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to this hour with less
 penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands could have taken a
 linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done it. The miserable
 man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that he could not
 discuss my prospects without having me before him,?as it were, to
 operate upon,?and he would drag me up from my stool (usually by the
 collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the fire as
 if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, "Now, Mum, here is
 this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up your
 head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now, Mum,
 with respections to this boy!" And then he would rumple my hair the wrong
 way,?which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I have
 in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,?and would
 hold me before him by the sleeve,?a spectacle of imbecility only to
 be equalled by himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
 about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me, that
 I used to want?quite painfully?to burst into spiteful tears,
 fly at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister
 spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every
 reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron, would
 sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of my
 fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at, while
 they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he was not
 favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old enough now to
 be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees
 thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would
 so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part,
 that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his hands, shake him,
 and put it away. There was a most irritating end to every one of these
 debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to it, my sister would
 stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as it were incidentally,
 would swoop upon me with, "Come! there's enough of you! You get along to
 bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I hope!" As if I had
 besought them as a favor to bother my life out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we
 should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss
 Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my
 shoulder; and said with some displeasure,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are growing tall, Pip!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that
 this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at me
 again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody. On
 the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and I had
 landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of her
 impatient fingers:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Joe Gargery, ma'am."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with you,
 and bring your indentures, do you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then let him come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At any particular time, Miss Havisham?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come
 along with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister
 "went on the Rampage," in a more alarming degree than at any previous
 period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under
 our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously
 thought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such
 inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got
 out the dustpan,?which was always a very bad sign,?put on her
 coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied
 with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned
 us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard. It
 was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then
 she asked Joe why he hadn't married a Negress Slave at once? Joe offered
 no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and looking
 dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a better
 speculation.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe
 arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham's.
 However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the occasion, it was
 not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his working-dress; the
 rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable,
 entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled up his
 shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the crown of
 his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with
 us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for "when we had done
 with our fine ladies"?a way of putting the case, from which Joe
 appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,
 and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on
 the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable HOUT,
 accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction
 he had taken.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
 bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited
 Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was a
 fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried
 penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were displayed as
 articles of property,?much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady
 on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it was
 almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house. Estella
 opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took his hat
 off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if he had some
 urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an
 ounce.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew so
 well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back at Joe
 in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care,
 and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and
 conducted him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was seated at her
 dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" said she to Joe. "You are the husband of the sister of this boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so
 like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his tuft
 of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are the husband," repeated Miss Havisham, "of the sister of this
 boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in
 addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe now observed in a manner that was at once
 expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great
 politeness, "as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time what
 you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said Miss Havisham. "And you have reared the boy, with the
 intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know, Pip," replied Joe, "as you and me were ever friends, and it
 were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to larks.
 Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,?such
 as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,?not but what they
 would have been attended to, don't you see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has the boy," said Miss Havisham, "ever made any objection? Does he like
 the trade?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip," returned Joe, strengthening
 his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, "that it
 were the wish of your own hart." (I saw the idea suddenly break upon him
 that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on to say)
 "And there weren't no objection on your part, and Pip it were the great
 wish of your hart!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he ought
 to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to him to do
 it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he persisted in
 being to Me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you brought his indentures with you?" asked Miss Havisham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Pip, you know," replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable,
 "you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore you know as they are
 here." With which he took them out, and gave them, not to Miss Havisham,
 but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow,?I know
 I was ashamed of him,?when I saw that Estella stood at the back of
 Miss Havisham's chair, and that her eyes laughed mischievously. I took the
 indentures out of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You expected," said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, "no premium
 with the boy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Joe!" I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. "Why don't you answer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip," returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, "which I
 meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
 and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to
 be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
 better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took up
 a little bag from the table beside her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip has earned a premium here," she said, "and here it is. There are
 five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him
 by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,
 persisted in addressing me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is wery liberal on your part, Pip," said Joe, "and it is as such
 received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near, nor
 nowheres. And now, old chap," said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first
 of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression
 were applied to Miss Havisham,?"and now, old chap, may we do our
 duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another, and by
 them which your liberal present?have-conweyed?to be?for
 the satisfaction of mind-of?them as never?" here Joe showed
 that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he
 triumphantly rescued himself with the words, "and from myself far be it!"
 These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said
 them twice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good by, Pip!" said Miss Havisham. "Let them out, Estella."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?" I asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe in
 a distinct emphatic voice, "The boy has been a good boy here, and that is
 his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no other and no
 more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I
 know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding up stairs instead
 of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him
 and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the gate, and it
 was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the daylight alone
 again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me, "Astonishing!" And
 there he remained so long saying, "Astonishing" at intervals, so often,
 that I began to think his senses were never coming back. At length he
 prolonged his remark into "Pip, I do assure you this is as-TON-ishing!"
 and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to walk away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the
 encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's he
 invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what took
 place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting ourselves, my
 sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. "And what's happened
 to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this,
 I am sure I do!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham," said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of
 remembrance, "made it wery partick'ler that we should give her?were
 it compliments or respects, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Compliments," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which that were my own belief," answered Joe; "her compliments to Mrs. J.
 Gargery?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Much good they'll do me!" observed my sister; but rather gratified too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And wishing," pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another
 effort of remembrance, "that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were sitch
 as would have?allowed, were it, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of her having the pleasure," I added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of ladies' company," said Joe. And drew a long breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook. "She
 might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but it's
 better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She giv' him," said Joe, "nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What she giv'," said Joe, "she giv' to his friends. 'And by his friends,'
 were her explanation, 'I mean into the hands of his sister Mrs. J.
 Gargery.' Them were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' She mayn't have know'd,"
 added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, "whether it were Joe, or
 Jorge."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
 arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all about
 it beforehand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And how much have you got?" asked my sister, laughing. Positively
 laughing!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What would present company say to ten pound?" demanded Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd say," returned my sister, curtly, "pretty well. Not too much, but
 pretty well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's more than that, then," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he
 rubbed the arms of his chair, "It's more than that, Mum."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you don't mean to say?" began my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes I do, Mum," said Pumblechook; "but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good in
 you! Go on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What would present company say," proceeded Joe, "to twenty pound?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Handsome would be the word," returned my sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," said Joe, "It's more than twenty pound."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a
 patronizing laugh, "It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,
 Joseph!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then to make an end of it," said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my
 sister; "it's five-and-twenty pound."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers,
 Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; "and it's no more than your
 merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the
 money!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently
 awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,
 with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you see, Joseph and wife," said Pumblechook, as he took me by the arm
 above the elbow, "I am one of them that always go right through with what
 they've begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That's my way. Bound
 out of hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook," said my sister (grasping the money),
 "we're deeply beholden to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind me, Mum," returned that diabolical cornchandler. "A pleasure's
 a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we must have him
 bound. I said I'd see to it?to tell you the truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once
 went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence.
 I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I
 had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the
 general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed; for, as
 Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some people
 say, "What's he done?" and others, "He's a young 'un, too, but looks bad,
 don't he?" One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract
 ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a
 perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a
 church,?and with people hanging over the pews looking on,?and
 with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs,
 with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or
 reading the newspapers,?and with some shining black portraits on the
 walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
 sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
 attested, and I was "bound"; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as
 if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little
 preliminaries disposed of.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put
 into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and
 who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying
 round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my sister became so
 excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve her but we
 must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and that
 Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mr.
 Wopsle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it
 inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
 company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it
 worse, they all asked me from time to time,?in short, whenever they
 had nothing else to do,?why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I
 possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,?when I wasn't!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the most
 of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver
 of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when he
 addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly
 congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at
 cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company, or indulged
 in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate
 as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair beside him to
 illustrate his remarks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn't
 let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up and
 told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave
 us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down, with
 such effect, that a waiter came in and said, "The Commercials underneath
 sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms." That, they
 were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr.
 Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in
 reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most
 impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody's private
 affairs) that he was the man with his white locks flowing, and that he was
 upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly
 wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's
 trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIV
 </h2>
 <p>
 It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black
 ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well
 deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister's
 temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had
 believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed in
 the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn
 opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had believed in
 the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I had believed
 in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence. Within a
 single year all this was changed. Now it was all coarse and common, and I
 would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,
 how much Miss Havisham's, how much my sister's, is now of no moment to me
 or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or ill
 done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my
 shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's 'prentice, I should be
 distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt that
 I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight upon my
 daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have been
 occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have felt
 for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and
 romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more. Never
 has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in life lay
 stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of
 apprenticeship to Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I remember that at a later period of my "time," I used to stand about the
 churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my own
 perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness
 between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both there
 came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite as
 dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that
 after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe
 while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know
 of myself in that connection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I
 proceed to add was Joe's. It was not because I was faithful, but because
 Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a
 sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,
 but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I
 worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible to know
 how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies
 out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched
 one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that
 intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and
 not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What I
 dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and
 commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the
 wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she would,
 sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing the
 coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me. Often
 after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing
 Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham's
 would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her pretty hair
 fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,?often at such a
 time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which
 the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just drawing
 her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would have a
 more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than
 ever, in my own ungracious breast.

 Chapter XV
 </h2>
 <p>
 As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's room, my education
 under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until Biddy had
 imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue of prices,
 to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny. Although the only
 coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I went to Lunnon town sirs, Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Wasn't I
 done very brown sirs? Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul?still, in my
 desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost
 gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I
 thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the
 poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to
 bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied. As
 it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure,
 to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and
 stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that
 course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his poetic fury had
 severely mauled me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so
 well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted to
 make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my society
 and less open to Estella's reproach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken
 slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:
 to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to remember
 anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any
 piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery
 with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,?even with a
 learned air,?as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely.
 Dear fellow, I hope he did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing
 beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking as if
 they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of
 the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their
 white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella; and
 whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green
 hillside or water-line, it was just the same.?Miss Havisham and
 Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have
 something to do with everything that was picturesque.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on
 being "most awful dull," that I had given him up for the day, I lay on the
 earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss
 Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water,
 until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had
 been much in my head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Joe," said I; "don't you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Pip," returned Joe, slowly considering. "What for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is some wisits p'r'aps," said Joe, "as for ever remains open to the
 question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might think
 you wanted something,?expected something of her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You might, old chap," said Joe. "And she might credit it. Similarly she
 mightn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard at
 his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You see, Pip," Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, "Miss
 Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the
 handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe. I heard her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "ALL," Joe repeated, very emphatically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,?Make a
 end on it!?As you was!?Me to the North, and you to the South!?Keep
 in sunders!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to
 find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, old chap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day of
 my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after her, or
 shown that I remember her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all
 four round,?and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four
 round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of hoofs?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.
 "Or even," said he, "if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for
 the front door,?or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for
 general use,?or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork
 when she took her muffins,?or a gridiron when she took a sprat or
 such like?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't mean any present at all, Joe," I interposed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed
 it, "if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would not. For what's a
 door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is open to
 misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go into brass and
 do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't show himself
 oncommon in a gridiron,?for a gridiron IS a gridiron," said Joe,
 steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to rouse me
 from a fixed delusion, "and you may haim at what you like, but a gridiron
 it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave, and you can't
 help yourself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear Joe," I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, "don't go
 on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Pip," Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all along;
 "and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack just
 now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go
 up-town and make a call on Miss Est?Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which her name," said Joe, gravely, "ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she
 have been rechris'ened."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,
 Joe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of it.
 But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with
 cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit
 which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor
 received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By these
 conditions I promised to abide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He
 pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,?a clear Impossibility,?but
 he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to have
 been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to have
 imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding. He
 was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never
 in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even seemed to come to his work
 on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when he went
 to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or went away at night, he would
 slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he
 was going and no intention of ever coming back. He lodged at a
 sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on working-days would come
 slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in his pockets and his dinner
 loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back. On
 Sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice-gates, or stood against ricks
 and barns. He always slouched, locomotively, with his eyes on the ground;
 and, when accosted or otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a
 half-resentful, half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had
 was, that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be
 thinking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and
 timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of
 the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was
 necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and
 that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's 'prentice, Orlick
 was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;
 howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did
 anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat
 his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came in
 out of time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of my
 half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just got a
 piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by and by he
 said, leaning on his hammer,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, master! Sure you're not a going to favor only one of us. If Young
 Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick." I suppose he was about
 five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?" said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'll I do with it! What'll he do with it? I'll do as much with it as
 him," said Orlick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As to Pip, he's going up town," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well then, as to Old Orlick, he's a going up town," retorted that worthy.
 "Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't lose your temper," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall if I like," growled Orlick. "Some and their up-towning! Now,
 master! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a
 better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot bar, made
 at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body, whisked it
 round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,?as if it were
 I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,?and finally
 said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he again
 leaned on his hammer,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, master!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you all right now?" demanded Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! I am all right," said gruff Old Orlick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men," said
 Joe, "let it be a half-holiday for all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,?she
 was a most unscrupulous spy and listener,?and she instantly looked
 in at one of the windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like you, you fool!" said she to Joe, "giving holidays to great idle
 hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in
 that way. I wish I was his master!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'd be everybody's master, if you durst," retorted Orlick, with an
 ill-favored grin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("Let her alone," said Joe.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues," returned my sister,
 beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. "And I couldn't be a match
 for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who's the
 dunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn't be a match for the
 rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and
 the worst rogue between this and France. Now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery," growled the journeyman. "If that
 makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("Let her alone, will you?" said Joe.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you say?" cried my sister, beginning to scream. "What did you
 say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me, with
 my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!" Each of these exclamations was a
 shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all the
 violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for her,
 because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she
 consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
 into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; "what was the name
 he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me! Oh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah-h-h!" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, "I'd hold you, if you
 was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("I tell you, let her alone," said Joe.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! To hear him!" cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a scream
 together,?which was her next stage. "To hear the names he's giving
 me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my husband
 standing by! Oh! Oh!" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings and
 screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and threw
 her cap off, and pulled her hair down,?which were the last stages on
 her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete
 success, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical
 interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant
 by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was
 man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of
 nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway; so,
 without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went at
 one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood could
 stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he had been
 of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very soon among the
 coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe unlocked the door
 and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible at the window (but who
 had seen the fight first, I think), and who was carried into the house and
 laid down, and who was recommended to revive, and would do nothing but
 struggle and clench her hands in Joe's hair. Then, came that singular calm
 and silence which succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation
 which I have always connected with such a lull,?namely, that it was
 Sunday, and somebody was dead,?I went up stairs to dress myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any
 other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils,
 which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared
 from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable
 manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe, who
 followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation that might
 do me good, "On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip:?such is
 Life!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very serious
 in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to Miss
 Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed the gate
 many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I debated
 whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should undoubtedly
 have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How, then? You here again?" said Miss Pocket. "What do you want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah evidently
 deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business. But
 unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and presently
 brought the sharp message that I was to "come up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?" said she, fixing her eyes upon me. "I hope you want nothing?
 You'll get nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing very
 well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There, there!" with the old restless fingers. "Come now and then; come on
 your birthday.?Ay!" she cried suddenly, turning herself and her
 chair towards me, "You are looking round for Estella? Hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had been looking round,?in fact, for Estella,?and I
 stammered that I hoped she was well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Abroad," said Miss Havisham; "educating for a lady; far out of reach;
 prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you have
 lost her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,
 and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what to
 say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When the
 gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I felt
 more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
 everything; and that was all I took by that motion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at the
 shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman, who
 should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in his hand
 the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that moment
 invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on the head
 of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner did he see
 me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a
 'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me, and insisted
 on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I knew it would be
 miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary, and
 almost any companionship on the road was better than none, I made no great
 resistance; consequently, we turned into Pumblechook's just as the street
 and the shops were lighting up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I
 don't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it took
 until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle got
 into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became so
 much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I thought
 it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his
 flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf after leaf,
 ever since his course began. This, however, was a mere question of length
 and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the identification of the whole
 affair with my unoffending self. When Barnwell began to go wrong, I
 declare that I felt positively apologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare
 so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst
 light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with
 no extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument,
 on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master's daughter to
 care a button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating
 conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general
 feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had
 closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his head, and
 saying, "Take warning, boy, take warning!" as if it were a well-known fact
 that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only
 induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with Mr.
 Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it
 fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamp's
 usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog. We
 were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of
 wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon a man,
 slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa!" we said, stopping. "Orlick there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" he answered, slouching out. "I was standing by a minute, on the
 chance of company."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are late," I remarked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Orlick not unnaturally answered, "Well? And you're late."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We have been," said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,?"we
 have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all
 went on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his
 half-holiday up and down town?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said he, "all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see you,
 but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is going
 again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At the Hulks?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been
 going since dark, about. You'll hear one presently."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the well-remembered
 boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along
 the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing and threatening the
 fugitives.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A good night for cutting off in," said Orlick. "We'd be puzzled how to
 bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in silence.
 Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's tragedy, fell to
 meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his hands in
 his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark, very wet, very
 muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound of the signal
 cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along the course of
 the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr. Wopsle died
 amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field, and in the
 greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes growled, "Beat it out,
 beat it out,?Old Clem! With a clink for the stout,?Old Clem!"
 I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us
 past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find?it
 being eleven o'clock?in a state of commotion, with the door wide
 open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down
 scattered about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter
 (surmising that a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great
 hurry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's something wrong," said he, without stopping, "up at your place,
 Pip. Run all!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently entered
 when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has been attacked
 and hurt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no stop
 until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole village
 was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there was Joe, and
 there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen.
 The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me, and so I became
 aware of my sister,?lying without sense or movement on the bare
 boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of
 the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the
 fire,?destined never to be on the Rampage again, while she was the
 wife of Joe.

 <h2>
 Chapter XVI
 </h2>
 <p>
 With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe
 that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at all
 events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under obligations
 to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else. But
 when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to reconsider the
 matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I took another
 view of the case, which was more reasonable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a quarter
 after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was there, my sister
 had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged Good Night
 with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more particular as to
 the time at which he saw her (he got into dense confusion when he tried to
 be), than that it must have been before nine. When Joe went home at five
 minutes before ten, he found her struck down on the floor, and promptly
 called in assistance. The fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was
 the snuff of the candle very long; the candle, however, had been blown
 out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond
 the blowing out of the candle,?which stood on a table between the
 door and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and
 was struck,?was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting
 such as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one
 remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with
 something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were
 dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
 violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe
 picked her up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed asunder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have been
 filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and
 people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion was corroborated.
 They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which
 it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed to know for certain
 that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two
 convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of those two was already
 retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed the
 iron to be my convict's iron,?the iron I had seen and heard him
 filing at, on the marshes,?but my mind did not accuse him of having
 put it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have
 become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
 Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
 picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the
 evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and he
 had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against him,
 save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with
 everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if he
 had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute
 about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them. Besides,
 there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and
 suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look round.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however
 undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable
 trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last
 dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For months
 afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the negative, and
 reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention came, after all, to
 this;?the secret was such an old one now, had so grown into me and
 become a part of myself, that I could not tear it away. In addition to the
 dread that, having led up to so much mischief, it would be now more likely
 than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it, I had a further
 restraining dread that he would not believe it, but would assort it with
 the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention. However, I
 temporized with myself, of course?for, was I not wavering between
 right and wrong, when the thing is always done??and resolved to make
 a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of
 helping in the discovery of the assailant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Constables and the Bow Street men from London?for, this happened
 in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police?were about the
 house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of
 like authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously
 wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas, and
 persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead of
 trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood about the
 door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled
 the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner
 of taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit. But
 not quite, for they never did it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very
 ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,
 and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities;
 her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was
 unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to be helped down
 stairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her, that she
 might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech. As she
 was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent speller, and as
 Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose
 between them which I was always called in to solve. The administration of
 mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker
 for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A tremulous
 uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her
 regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three months, she
 would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain for about a
 week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were at a loss to
 find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance happened
 conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt conquered a confirmed
 habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our
 establishment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the
 kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
 whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
 Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly
 cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had
 been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me every
 now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, "Such a fine figure of
 a woman as she once were, Pip!" Biddy instantly taking the cleverest
 charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe became able
 in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life, and to get down
 to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good. It was
 characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less
 suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they had to a man
 concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever
 encountered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that
 had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing
 of it. Thus it was:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a
 character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness
 had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted. I had
 in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast
 and tub. At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a
 hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my sister's ear, she had
 begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent.
 Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but
 without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the
 same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my sister
 with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to that extent when
 she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered
 state she should dislocate her neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this
 mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at it,
 heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked
 thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his
 initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, of course!" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. "Don't you see? It's
 him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify him
 by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen, and
 he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his arm, took another
 wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose
 vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was
 disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest anxiety
 to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his being at
 length produced, and motioned that she would have him given something to
 drink. She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to
 be assured that he took kindly to his reception, she showed every possible
 desire to conciliate him, and there was an air of humble propitiation in
 all she did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a
 hard master. After that day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the
 hammer on her slate, and without Orlick's slouching in and standing
 doggedly before her, as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it.

 <h2>
 Chapter XVII
 </h2>
 <p>
 I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was varied
 beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more remarkable
 circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit
 to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate; I
 found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke of Estella in
 the very same way, if not in the very same words. The interview lasted but
 a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was going, and told me to
 come again on my next birthday. I may mention at once that this became an
 annual custom. I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion,
 but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I
 expected more? Then, and after that, I took it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened
 room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I
 felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious
 place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood
 still. Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances
 of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It bewildered me, and under
 its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of
 home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her shoes
 came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were always
 clean. She was not beautiful,?she was common, and could not be like
 Estella,?but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered. She
 had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly out of
 mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one evening
 that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very
 pretty and very good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at?writing
 some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort
 of stratagem?and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about. I laid
 down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," said I, "how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you
 are very clever."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it that I manage? I don't know," returned Biddy, smiling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not
 mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you manage, Biddy," said I, "to learn everything that I learn, and
 always to keep up with me?" I was beginning to be rather vain of my
 knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the
 greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no
 doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I might as well ask you," said Biddy, "how you manage?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me
 turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose I must catch it like a cough," said Biddy, quietly; and went on
 with her sewing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddy
 sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an
 extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally
 accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different
 sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy
 knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are one of those, Biddy," said I, "who make the most of every chance.
 You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you
 are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. "I was
 your first teacher though; wasn't I?" said she, as she sewed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy!" I exclaimed, in amazement. "Why, you are crying!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No I am not," said Biddy, looking up and laughing. "What put that in your
 head?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
 dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been
 until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
 living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled
 the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
 miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with
 that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
 shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have
 been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness
 and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course. Biddy
 sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and
 thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been
 sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should
 have patronized her more (though I did not use that precise word in my
 meditations) with my confidence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Biddy," I observed, when I had done turning it over, "you were my
 first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
 together like this, in this kitchen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, poor thing!" replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to
 transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,
 making her more comfortable; "that's sadly true!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said I, "we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.
 And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a quiet
 walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook
 the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out
 together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the
 village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and
 began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to combine
 Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way. When we came
 to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water rippling at our
 feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound,
 I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy
 into my inner confidence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," said I, after binding her to secrecy, "I want to be a gentleman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O, I wouldn't, if I was you!" she returned. "I don't think it would
 answer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," said I, with some severity, "I have particular reasons for
 wanting to be a gentleman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," I exclaimed, impatiently, "I am not at all happy as I am. I am
 disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to either,
 since I was bound. Don't be absurd."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was I absurd?" said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; "I am sorry for
 that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be
 comfortable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be
 comfortable?or anything but miserable?there, Biddy!?unless
 I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's a pity!" said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of
 quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to
 shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her
 sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much to
 be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I could have settled down," I said to Biddy, plucking up the short
 grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out
 of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,?"if I could have
 settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was
 little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe
 would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone
 partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to keep
 company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
 Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;
 shouldn't I, Biddy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for
 answer, "Yes; I am not over-particular." It scarcely sounded flattering,
 but I knew she meant well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Instead of that," said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
 two, "see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and?what
 would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me
 so!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more
 attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say," she remarked,
 directing her eyes to the ships again. "Who said it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was
 going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, "The
 beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more beautiful than
 anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want to be a
 gentleman on her account." Having made this lunatic confession, I began to
 throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of
 following it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?" Biddy
 quietly asked me, after a pause.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," I moodily answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because, if it is to spite her," Biddy pursued, "I should think?but
 you know best?that might be better and more independently done by
 caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should
 think?but you know best?she was not worth gaining over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was perfectly
 manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed village lad,
 avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men
 fall every day?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire her
 dreadfully."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good
 grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the
 while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,
 that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I had
 lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a
 punishment for belonging to such an idiot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.
 She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,
 upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
 Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face
 upon my sleeve I cried a little,?exactly as I had done in the
 brewery yard,?and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much
 ill-used by somebody, or by everybody; I can't say which.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am glad of one thing," said Biddy, "and that is, that you have felt you
 could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing, and
 that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and
 always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor one,
 and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher at the
 present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But it would
 be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it's of no use
 now." So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said,
 with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, "Shall we walk a little
 farther, or go home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving
 her a kiss, "I shall always tell you everything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Till you're a gentleman," said Biddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any occasion
 to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,?as I told you
 at home the other night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships. And
 then repeated, with her former pleasant change, "shall we walk a little
 farther, or go home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the
 summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very
 beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and
 wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing
 beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,
 and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if I
 could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances and
 fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do, and
 stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question whether
 I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment
 instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to admit that
 I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, "Pip, what a fool you
 are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right.
 Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and somebody
 else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from
 giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than
 mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of
 the two?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," said I, when we were walking homeward, "I wish you could put me
 right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish I could!" said Biddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,?you don't mind
 my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh dear, not at all!" said Biddy. "Don't mind me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you never will, you see," said Biddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have
 done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed I was
 not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it
 decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it
 rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get
 over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or from
 the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way), Old
 Orlick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa!" he growled, "where are you two going?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where should we be going, but home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, then," said he, "I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his.
 He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used
 it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and convey
 an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I had had a
 general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would have done
 it with a sharp and twisted hook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,
 "Don't let him come; I don't like him." As I did not like him either, I
 took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want seeing
 home. He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and
 dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little distance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that
 murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
 account, I asked her why she did not like him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,
 "because I?I am afraid he likes me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did he ever tell you he liked you?" I asked indignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, "he never told me so;
 but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt
 the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon Old
 Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But it makes no difference to you, you know," said Biddy, calmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't
 approve of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nor I neither," said Biddy. "Though that makes no difference to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Exactly," said I; "but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,
 Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were
 favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that
 demonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of my
 sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him
 dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I
 had reason to know thereafter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated its
 confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was
 clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain
 honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed
 of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness. At
 those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old
 Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be
 partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,?when all in a
 moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon
 me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again. Scattered wits
 take a long time picking up; and often before I had got them well
 together, they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought,
 that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my
 time was out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my
 perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought
 to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.

 <h2>
 Chapter XVIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a
 Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three
 Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud. Of
 that group I was one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in
 blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the
 description, and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest. He
 faintly moaned, "I am done for," as the victim, and he barbarously
 bellowed, "I'll serve you out," as the murderer. He gave the medical
 testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and he piped
 and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to an extent
 so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of
 that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle's hands, became Timon of Athens;
 the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed
 ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this cosey state of mind
 we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
 the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression of
 contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
 watched the group of faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, "you
 have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked at
 everybody coldly and sarcastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Guilty, of course?" said he. "Out with it. Come!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir," returned Mr. Wopsle, "without having the honor of your
 acquaintance, I do say Guilty." Upon this we all took courage to unite in
 a confirmatory murmur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know you do," said the stranger; "I knew you would. I told you so. But
 now I'll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that the law
 of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is proved-proved?to
 be guilty?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sir," Mr. Wopsle began to reply, "as an Englishman myself, I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come!" said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. "Don't evade the
 question. Either you know it, or you don't know it. Which is it to be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a bullying,
 interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr. Wopsle,?as
 it were to mark him out?before biting it again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now!" said he. "Do you know it, or don't you know it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly I know it," replied Mr. Wopsle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly you know it. Then why didn't you say so at first? Now, I'll ask
 you another question,"?taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he had
 a right to him,?"do you know that none of these witnesses have yet
 been cross-examined?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle was beginning, "I can only say?" when the stranger
 stopped him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? You won't answer the question, yes or no? Now, I'll try you again."
 Throwing his finger at him again. "Attend to me. Are you aware, or are you
 not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?
 Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
 of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come!" said the stranger, "I'll help you. You don't deserve help, but
 I'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is it?" repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it," pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner,
 "the printed paper you have just been reading from?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Undoubtedly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly
 states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed
 him altogether to reserve his defence?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I read that just now," Mr. Wopsle pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read
 just now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,?and,
 perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my
 friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the
 bottom, to the bottom." (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of
 subterfuge.) "Well? Have you found it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here it is," said Mr. Wopsle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly
 states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his
 legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do you make that of
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Wopsle answered, "Those are not the exact words."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not the exact words!" repeated the gentleman bitterly. "Is that the exact
 substance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said Mr. Wopsle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company
 with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. "And now I ask
 you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage
 before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced
 a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought
 him, and that he was beginning to be found out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And that same man, remember," pursued the gentleman, throwing his finger
 at Mr. Wopsle heavily,?"that same man might be summoned as a juryman
 upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself, might
 return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow, after
 deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined
 between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and would
 a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help him God!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far,
 and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and
 with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us
 that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it,
 left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two
 settles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand
 in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "From information I have received," said he, looking round at us as we all
 quailed before him, "I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among
 you, by name Joseph?or Joe?Gargery. Which is the man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is the man," said Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have an apprentice," pursued the stranger, "commonly known as Pip? Is
 he here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am here!" I cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman I
 had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss
 Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,
 and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder, I
 checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his
 deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his strong
 black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on his
 great hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish to have a private conference with you two," said he, when he had
 surveyed me at his leisure. "It will take a little time. Perhaps we had
 better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my
 communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you
 please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen, and
 in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange
 gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of his
 finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an
 impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door. Our
 conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one
 candle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table, drawing
 the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book. He
 then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after
 peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was
 which.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My name," he said, "is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am pretty
 well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I commence
 by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice had been
 asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you see me here.
 What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I do. No less, no
 more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got up,
 and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus having
 one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this
 young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his
 indentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for so
 doing?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way,"
 said Joe, staring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose," returned Mr. Jaggers.
 "The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want anything?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The answer is," returned Joe, sternly, "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for
 his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless
 curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well," said Mr. Jaggers. "Recollect the admission you have made, and
 don't try to go from it presently."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's a going to try?" retorted Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I do keep a dog."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
 Bear that in mind, will you?" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes and
 nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something. "Now, I
 return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to make is,
 that he has Great Expectations."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am instructed to communicate to him," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his
 finger at me sideways, "that he will come into a handsome property.
 Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property,
 that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from
 this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,?in a word, as a young
 fellow of great expectations."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss
 Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Mr. Pip," pursued the lawyer, "I address the rest of what I have to
 say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the
 person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of
 Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations
 being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have any objection,
 this is the time to mention it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,
 that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that
 the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
 secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention
 that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word
 of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried out, I
 cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are distinctly
 to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any
 inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to
 any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you
 may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that
 suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to the purpose what the
 reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest
 reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for you to inquire into.
 The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it, and your observance of
 it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by
 the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not
 otherwise responsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your
 expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.
 Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise
 in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to
 mention it. Speak out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations." Though
 he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still could
 not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now he
 occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke, as
 much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement,
 if he only chose to mention them. "We come next, to mere details of
 arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the term
 'expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only.
 There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for
 your suitable education and maintenance. You will please consider me your
 guardian. Oh!" for I was going to thank him, "I tell you at once, I am
 paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them. It is considered that
 you must be better educated, in accordance with your altered position, and
 that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering
 on that advantage."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said I had always longed for it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip," he retorted; "keep
 to the record. If you long for it now, that's enough. Am I answered that
 you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor? Is that it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I stammered yes, that was it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don't think that
 wise, mind, but it's my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
 would prefer to another?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt; so,
 I replied in the negative.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think
 might suit the purpose," said Mr. Jaggers. "I don't recommend him,
 observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is
 one Mr. Matthew Pocket."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham's relation. The Matthew
 whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to be
 at Miss Havisham's head, when she lay dead, in her bride's dress on the
 bride's table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know the name?" said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then
 shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My answer was, that I had heard of the name.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" said he. "You have heard of the name. But the question is, what do
 you say of it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his
 recommendation?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my young friend!" he interrupted, shaking his great head very slowly.
 "Recollect yourself!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him for
 his recommendation?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my young friend," he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and
 smiling both at once,?"no, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't
 do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,
 Mr. Pip. Try another."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention
 of Mr. Matthew Pocket?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's more like it!" cried Mr. Jaggers.?And (I added), I would
 gladly try that gentleman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be prepared
 for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When will you
 come to London?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I
 supposed I could come directly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First," said Mr. Jaggers, "you should have some new clothes to come in,
 and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You'll want
 some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them out
 on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he had
 taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he had
 pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am!" said Joe, in a very decided manner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It were understood," said Joe. "And it are understood. And it ever will
 be similar according."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But what," said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,?"what if it was in
 my instructions to make you a present, as compensation?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As compensation what for?" Joe demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For the loss of his services."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have often
 thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or pat an
 egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. "Pip is that
 hearty welcome," said Joe, "to go free with his services, to honor and
 fortun', as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money can make
 compensation to me for the loss of the little child?what come to the
 forge?and ever the best of friends!?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see
 you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes, and your
 broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good faithful
 tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as
 solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's wing!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future
 fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I
 begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best of
 friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes with
 his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but said not
 another word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the
 village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing
 in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half
 measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge
 to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you mean
 to say?" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe's
 suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
 purpose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which I meantersay," cried Joe, "that if you come into my place
 bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if
 you're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay
 and stand or fall by!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to me,
 in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom
 it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be bull-baited and
 badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated,
 and had backed near the door. Without evincing any inclination to come in
 again, he there delivered his valedictory remarks. They were these.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here?as you are to be a
 gentleman?the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall
 receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach
 at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me. Understand,
 that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust I undertake. I
 am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand that, finally.
 Understand that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on,
 but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was
 going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Halloa!" said he, facing round, "what's the matter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions; so
 I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking
 leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't mean in the village only, but up town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said he. "No objection."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already
 locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by the
 kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning
 coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals, and nothing
 was said for a long time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her
 needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe in
 the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing coals,
 the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the silence
 lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length I got out, "Joe, have you told Biddy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Pip," returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his knees
 tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make off
 somewhere, "which I left it to yourself, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I would rather you told, Joe."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then," said Joe, "and God bless him in it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked at
 me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily
 congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
 congratulations that I rather resented.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the
 grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say
 nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good time,
 I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save that I had
 come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy nodded her
 head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again, and said she
 would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his knees, said, "Ay,
 ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;" and then they congratulated me
 again, and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a
 gentleman that I didn't half like it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea
 of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely
 failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even
 repeated after Biddy, the words "Pip" and "Property." But I doubt if they
 had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a
 darker picture of her state of mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy
 became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
 Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible
 that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, looking
 into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about what
 they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I caught one of them
 looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me,?particularly
 Biddy), I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me.
 Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen
 door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to
 air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid I
 took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects
 among which I had passed my life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Saturday night," said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
 and beer. "Five more days, and then the day before the day! They'll soon
 go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Pip," observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.
 "They'll soon go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Soon, soon go," said Biddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and order
 my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put them on
 there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It would be very
 disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure
 too, Pip," said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on
 it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper as if
 he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. "So might Wopsle.
 And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of
 it,?such a coarse and common business,?that I couldn't bear
 myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah, that indeed, Pip!" said Joe. "If you couldn't abear yourself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, "Have you
 thought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister
 and me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy," I returned with some resentment, "you are so exceedingly quick
 that it's difficult to keep up with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("She always were quick," observed Joe.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that
 I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,?most likely
 on the evening before I go away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an
 affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got
 into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean
 little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever.
 It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same
 moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and
 the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between
 the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and the
 room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe
 come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the
 air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light it for him.
 He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted
 comforting, for some reason or other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,
 and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they
 talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
 of them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could
 have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one
 chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
 first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever
 known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe
 floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,?not
 obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared
 together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy bed
 now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.

 <h2>
 Chapter XIX
 </h2>
 <p>
 Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life, and
 brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay heaviest
 on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and
 the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that
 something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and that, when I got
 there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our
 approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After
 breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
 parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With all
 the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and
 thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the rich man
 and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off the
 marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I felt
 (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion for the
 poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all
 their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green
 mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these
 days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef
 and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon
 everybody in the village.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my
 companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those
 graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled the
 wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My comfort
 was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless been
 transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might be
 veritably dead into the bargain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these
 grazing cattle,?though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a
 more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare
 as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations,?farewell,
 monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and
 greatness; not for smith's work in general, and for you! I made my
 exultant way to the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the
 question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me, smoking
 his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes, and
 said,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Joe, I am very glad you did so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thankee, Pip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may be sure, dear Joe," I went on, after we had shaken hands, "that I
 shall never forget you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, Pip!" said Joe, in a comfortable tone, "I'm sure of that. Ay, ay,
 old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in a
 man's mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it well
 round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe's being so mightily secure of me.
 I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said, "It
 does you credit, Pip," or something of that sort. Therefore, I made no
 remark on Joe's first head; merely saying as to his second, that the
 tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a
 gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I
 were one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you though?" said Joe. "Astonishing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pity now, Joe," said I, "that you did not get on a little more,
 when we had our lessons here; isn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I don't know," returned Joe. "I'm so awful dull. I'm only master of
 my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's no
 more of a pity now, than it was?this day twelvemonth?don't you
 see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to do
 something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had been
 better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly innocent of my
 meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in
 preference.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our little
 garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a general way
 for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget her, said I
 had a favor to ask of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And it is, Biddy," said I, "that you will not omit any opportunity of
 helping Joe on, a little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How helping him on?" asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,?in fact, I think he is the dearest
 fellow that ever lived,?but he is rather backward in some things.
 For instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her
 eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O, his manners! won't his manners do then?" asked Biddy, plucking a
 black-currant leaf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear Biddy, they do very well here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O! they do very well here?" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the
 leaf in her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hear me out,?but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I
 shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would
 hardly do him justice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And don't you think he knows that?" asked Biddy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most
 distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Biddy, what do you mean?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,?and the
 smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
 in the little garden by the side of the lane,?said, "Have you never
 considered that he may be proud?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Proud?" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O! there are many kinds of pride," said Biddy, looking full at me and
 shaking her head; "pride is not all of one kind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well? What are you stopping for?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not all of one kind," resumed Biddy. "He may be too proud to let any one
 take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well and
 with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds bold
 in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Biddy," said I, "I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
 expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You are
 dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help showing
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you have the heart to think so," returned Biddy, "say so. Say so over
 and over again, if you have the heart to think so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy," said I, in a virtuous
 and superior tone; "don't put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,
 and it's a?it's a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you
 to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of
 improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely sorry
 to see this in you, Biddy," I repeated. "It's a?it's a bad side of
 human nature."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whether you scold me or approve of me," returned poor Biddy, "you may
 equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at
 all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no
 difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be unjust
 neither," said Biddy, turning away her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which
 sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I
 was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy
 went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected
 stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that
 this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and
 unsatisfactory as the first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to
 Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had, I
 went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open, and
 presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his
 breakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth
 his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. "How are
 you, and what can I do for you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was
 slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a
 prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous
 little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
 the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of
 his prosperity were put away in it in bags.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Trabb," said I, "it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention, because
 it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome property."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from
 the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, "Lord
 bless my soul!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am going up to my guardian in London," said I, casually drawing some
 guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; "and I want a fashionable
 suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them," I added?otherwise
 I thought he might only pretend to make them, "with ready money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear sir," said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened
 his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
 elbow, "don't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate
 you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side. When
 I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his labors by
 sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with
 Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and
 obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any blacksmith,
 alive or dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold that noise," said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, "or I'll
 knock your head off!?Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,"
 said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a
 flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under it
 to show the gloss, "is a very sweet article. I can recommend it for your
 purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall see some
 others. Give me Number Four, you!" (To the boy, and with a dreadfully
 severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's brushing me with
 it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited
 number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again. Then he
 commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. "And let me have
 none of your tricks here," said Mr. Trabb, "or you shall repent it, you
 young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
 confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an
 article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it
 would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
 fellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having
 worn. "Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond," said Mr.
 Trabb to the boy after that, "or shall I kick you out of the shop and
 bring them myself?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's
 judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr. Trabb
 had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented with it,
 he said apologetically that it "wouldn't do under existing circumstances,
 sir,?wouldn't do at all." So, Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me
 in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest species of
 surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no
 suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains. When he had
 at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook's
 on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand upon the parlor lock, "I
 know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be expected to patronize local
 work, as a rule; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the
 quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem it. Good morning, sir, much
 obliged.?Door!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what it
 meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands,
 and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was, that
 it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the bootmaker's,
 and the hosier's, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard's dog whose outfit
 required the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office
 and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning. It was not
 necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property;
 but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that the
 officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the
 window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When I had
 ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook's,
 and, as I approached that gentleman's place of business, I saw him
 standing at his door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with
 the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had
 prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered his
 shopman to "come out of the gangway" as my sacred person passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when he
 and I and the collation were alone, "I give you joy of your good fortune.
 Well deserved, well deserved!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
 expressing himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To think," said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for some
 moments, "that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to
 this, is a proud reward."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
 hinted, on that point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook; "if you will allow me to
 call you so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I murmured "Certainly," and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,
 and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional
 appearance, though it was rather low down, "My dear young friend, rely
 upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before
 the mind of Joseph.?Joseph!" said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a
 compassionate adjuration. "Joseph!! Joseph!!!" Thereupon he shook his head
 and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But my dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, "you must be hungry, you
 must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the Boar,
 here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here's one or two little things
 had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do I," said
 Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat down, "see
 afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy? And
 may I?may I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,
 and then sat down again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here is wine," said Mr. Pumblechook. "Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,
 and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I
 cannot," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, "see afore me One?and
 likewise drink to One?without again expressing?May I?may
 I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass
 and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself
 upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to
 my head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
 tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and
 took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. "Ah! poultry,
 poultry! You little thought," said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the
 fowl in the dish, "when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for
 you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof
 for one as?Call it a weakness, if you will," said Mr. Pumblechook,
 getting up again, "but may I? may I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he
 did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with
 my knife, I don't know.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And your sister," he resumed, after a little steady eating, "which had
 the honor of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect that
 she's no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We'll drink her health," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid with
 admiration, "that's the way you know 'em, sir!" (I don't know who Sir was,
 but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person present);
 "that's the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving and ever
 affable. It might," said the servile Pumblechook, putting down his
 untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, "to a common person, have
 the appearance of repeating?but may I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. "Let us
 never be blind," said Mr. Pumblechook, "to her faults of temper, but it is
 to be hoped she meant well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the
 face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent
 to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I mentioned
 my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village, and he lauded
 it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he intimated, worthy of my
 confidence, and?in short, might he? Then he asked me tenderly if I
 remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have
 me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he had ever been my favorite
 fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken ten times as many glasses of
 wine as I had, I should have known that he never had stood in that
 relation towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the
 idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I had been much
 mistaken in him, and that he was a sensible, practical, good-hearted prime
 fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my
 advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an
 opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
 trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred before in
 that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the realization
 of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital. Those were the two
 little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him (Pumblechook) that if
 that capital were got into the business, through a sleeping partner, sir,?which
 sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in, by self or deputy,
 whenever he pleased, and examine the books,?and walk in twice a year
 and take his profits away in his pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,?it
 appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of
 spirit combined with property, which would be worthy of his attention. But
 what did I think? He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I
 think? I gave it as my opinion. "Wait a bit!" The united vastness and
 distinctness of this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he
 might shake hands with me, but said he really must,?and did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over
 again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don't know what mark), and to
 render me efficient and constant service (I don't know what service). He
 also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after
 having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,
 "That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun' will be no common
 fortun'." He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
 think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with a
 dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
 sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without
 having taken any account of the road.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He was a long way
 down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to stop.
 I stopped, and he came up breathless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, my dear friend," said he, when he had recovered wind for speech. "Not
 if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without that
 affability on your part.?May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?
 May I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young
 carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me
 and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road;
 and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I
 pursued my way home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little I
 possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same
 afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next
 morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I went
 to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss
 Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress in, and
 was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My clothes were
 rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and eagerly
 expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of
 the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my new suit on some half an
 hour, and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr.
 Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the futile endeavor to see
 my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being market morning at a
 neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook was not at home. I
 had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to
 shake hands with him again before departing. This was all as it should be,
 and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the
 shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage,
 something like Joe's in his Sunday suit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang at
 the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves.
 Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when she saw me
 so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to
 green and yellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You?" said she. "You? Good gracious! What do you want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am going to London, Miss Pocket," said I, "and want to say good by to
 Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went to
 ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned and
 took me up, staring at me all the way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table,
 leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and at the
 sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just abreast
 of the rotted bride-cake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't go, Sarah," she said. "Well, Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow," I was exceedingly careful
 what I said, "and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is a gay figure, Pip," said she, making her crutch stick play round
 me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the
 finishing gift.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham,"
 I murmured. "And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ay, ay!" said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with
 delight. "I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go
 to-morrow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you are adopted by a rich person?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not named?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her
 enjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay. "Well!" she went on; "you have
 a promising career before you. Be good?deserve it?and abide by
 Mr. Jaggers's instructions." She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and
 Sarah's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. "Good
 by, Pip!?you will always keep the name of Pip, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Havisham."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good by, Pip!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my
 lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came
 naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket with
 triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her
 hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room
 beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen out.
 She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree
 confounded. I said "Good by, Miss Pocket;" but she merely stared, and did
 not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the house, I
 made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new clothes,
 made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress, carrying it?to
 speak the truth?much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to
 carry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run out
 fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than
 I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to
 four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the
 society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I dressed my self out in
 my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime. We
 had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and
 we had some flip to finish with. We were all very low, and none the higher
 for pretending to be in spirits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
 hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone.
 I am afraid?sore afraid?that this purpose originated in my
 sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the
 coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this
 taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this
 last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an
 impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the
 morning. I did not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places
 instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now
 pigs, now men,?never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied
 me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and
 partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in
 taking it fell asleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not
 sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I
 started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon. But
 long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups
 and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go down stairs. After all,
 I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small
 portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to
 me that I was late.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,
 saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,
 "Well! I suppose I must be off!" and then I kissed my sister who was
 laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and
 threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little portmanteau and
 walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle
 behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and
 Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear
 old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head, crying huskily
 "Hooroar!" and Biddy put her apron to her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had
 supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to have
 had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High Street. I
 whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very peaceful and
 quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the
 world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all beyond was so
 unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke
 into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the village, and I
 laid my hand upon it, and said, "Good by, O my dear, dear friend!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon
 the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after
 I had cried than before,?more sorry, more aware of my own
 ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe
 with me then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the
 course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear
 of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get
 down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at
 home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and
 still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get
 down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied with
 these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man
 coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.?As
 if he could possibly be there!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go
 back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the
 world lay spread before me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.

 <h2>
 Chapter XX
 </h2>
 <p>
 The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
 hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by
 which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
 the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
 to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise, while
 I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had some
 faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he
 had written after it on his card, "just out of Smithfield, and close by
 the coach-office." Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as
 many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me up in
 his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps,
 as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his box, which
 I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green
 hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a
 wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things
 behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below
 them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
 straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the
 horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning
 to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop we presently
 did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was
 painted MR. JAGGERS.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much?" I asked the coachman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The coachman answered, "A shilling?unless you wish to make it more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it must be a shilling," observed the coachman. "I don't want to get
 into trouble. I know him!" He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's name,
 and shook his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the
 ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his mind),
 I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and
 asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is not," returned the clerk. "He is in Court at present. Am I
 addressing Mr. Pip?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn't say how
 long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time
 being valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner
 chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a
 velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
 being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go and wait outside, Mike," said the clerk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk shoved
 this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing
 his fur cap out after him, left me alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal
 place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the
 distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
 peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I
 should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that I
 should not have expected to see,?such as an old rusty pistol, a
 sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two
 dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about
 the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black
 horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied
 I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at the
 clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a
 habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to Mr.
 Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the
 one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the
 innocent cause of his being turned out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair,
 and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I called to
 mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody
 else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many other clerks
 there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same
 detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the
 history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there. I
 wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and,
 if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking
 relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies
 to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course I had no
 experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed
 by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on
 everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room,
 until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr.
 Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited,
 he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield. So
 I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with
 filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So, I rubbed it
 off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great
 black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building
 which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following the wall of the jail,
 I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing
 vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about
 smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
 minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial
 or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown,
 whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig
 and robes,?mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and
 presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I
 declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as to
 take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also where
 people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors' Door, out
 of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest of that
 dreadful portal by giving me to understand that "four on 'em" would come
 out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be
 killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of
 London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor wore (from his
 hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive)
 mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally, and
 which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner. Under
 these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I
 found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour of
 Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware
 that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I. There
 were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and
 thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they
 talked together, one of whom said to the other when they first passed me,
 that "Jaggers would do it if it was to be done." There was a knot of three
 men and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on
 her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by saying, as she pulled her
 own shawl over her shoulders, "Jaggers is for him, 'Melia, and what more
 could you have?" There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close
 while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom he
 sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this
 Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of
 anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy,
 with the words, "O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith
 Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!" These testimonies to the popularity of my
 guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more
 than ever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into
 Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me. All
 the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there was quite
 a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me
 on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his
 followers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First, he took the two secret men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, I have nothing to say to you," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger
 at them. "I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it's a
 toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you paid
 Wemmick?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We made the money up this morning, sir," said one of the men,
 submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up
 at all. Has Wemmick got it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir," said both the men together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!" said Mr Jaggers,
 waving his hand at them to put them behind him. "If you say a word to me,
 I'll throw up the case."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We thought, Mr. Jaggers?" one of the men began, pulling off his
 hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's what I told you not to do," said Mr. Jaggers. "You thought! I
 think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to find
 you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear a
 word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again,
 and humbly fell back and were heard no more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now you!" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two
 women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated,?"Oh!
 Amelia, is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Mr. Jaggers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And do you remember," retorted Mr. Jaggers, "that but for me you wouldn't
 be here and couldn't be here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O yes, sir!" exclaimed both women together. "Lord bless you, sir, well we
 knows that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then why," said Mr. Jaggers, "do you come here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My Bill, sir!" the crying woman pleaded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, I tell you what!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Once for all. If you don't know
 that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here bothering
 about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let
 him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O yes, sir! Every farden."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another word?one
 single word?and Wemmick shall give you your money back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No one
 remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of
 Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know this man!" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating strain:
 "What does this fellow want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who's he?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let go of my coat."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it,
 replied, "Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're too late," said Mr. Jaggers. "I am over the way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!" cried my excitable acquaintance, turning
 white, "don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am," said Mr. Jaggers, "and there's an end of it. Get out of the way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter
 Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter
 Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun to
 be bought off from the t'other thide?at hany thuperior prithe!?money
 no object!?Mithter Jaggerth?Mithter?!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left
 him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further
 interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and
 the man in velveteen with the fur cap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's Mike," said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and
 approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!" said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair
 in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the
 bell-rope; "your man comes on this afternoon. Well?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a
 constitutional cold; "arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as
 might do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is he prepared to swear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this
 time; "in a general way, anythink."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. "Now, I warned you before," said
 he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, "that if you ever
 presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You
 infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious
 what he had done.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Spooney!" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his
 elbow. "Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, I ask you, you blundering booby," said my guardian, very sternly,
 "once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is
 prepared to swear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson
 from his face, and slowly replied, "Ayther to character, or to having been
 in his company and never left him all the night in question."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
 ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning
 to reply in a nervous manner, "We've dressed him up like?" when my
 guardian blustered out,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What? You WILL, will you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 ("Spooney!" added the clerk again, with another stir.)
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is he here?" asked my guardian.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I left him," said Mike, "a setting on some doorsteps round the corner."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take him past that window, and let me see him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,
 behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental
 manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white
 linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not by any means
 sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was
 painted over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell him to take his witness away directly," said my guardian to the
 clerk, in extreme disgust, "and ask him what he means by bringing such a
 fellow as that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,
 standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to
 bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he
 had made for me. I was to go to "Barnard's Inn," to young Mr. Pocket's
 rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain
 with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his
 father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it. Also, I was
 told what my allowance was to be,?it was a very liberal one,?and
 had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards of certain
 tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other
 things as I could in reason want. "You will find your credit good, Mr.
 Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful,
 as he hastily refreshed himself, "but I shall by this means be able to
 check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the
 constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's no fault of
 mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr.
 Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while, I was
 so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk
 was rung down from up stairs to take his place while he was out, and I
 accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian. We
 found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among
 them by saying coolly yet decisively, "I tell you it's no use; he won't
 have a word to say to one of you;" and we soon got clear of them, and went
 on side by side.

 <h2>
 Chapter XXI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was like
 in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in stature,
 with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been
 imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks in
 it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the
 instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel had
 made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose, but
 had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him to be
 a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared to have
 sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four mourning
 rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb
 with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at
 his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed
 friends. He had glittering eyes,?small, keen, and black,?and
 thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of my belief, from
 forty to fifty years.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you were never in London before?" said Mr. Wemmick to me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was new here once," said Mr. Wemmick. "Rum to think of now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are well acquainted with it now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, yes," said Mr. Wemmick. "I know the moves of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is it a very wicked place?" I asked, more for the sake of saying
 something than for information.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are plenty
 of people anywhere, who'll do that for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If there is bad blood between you and them," said I, to soften it off a
 little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "O! I don't know about bad blood," returned Mr. Wemmick; "there's not much
 bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That makes it worse."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You think so?" returned Mr. Wemmick. "Much about the same, I should say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him:
 walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to
 claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he
 had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of Holborn
 Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he
 was not smiling at all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?" I asked Mr. Wemmick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," said he, nodding in the direction. "At Hammersmith, west of
 London."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that far?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! Say five miles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me
 with an approving air. "Yes, I know him. I know him!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
 these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at
 his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he
 said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not alleviated by
 the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel
 kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere
 public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a
 fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever
 squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an
 introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
 like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in it,
 and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most
 dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I
 thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
 divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled
 flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To
 Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches
 ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being
 slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their
 unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke
 attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its
 head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus
 far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots
 that rot in neglected roof and cellar,?rot of rat and mouse and bug
 and coaching-stables near at hand besides?addressed themselves
 faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, "Try Barnard's Mixture."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,
 that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. "Ah!" said he, mistaking me; "the
 retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,?which
 appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those
 days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves
 without the means of coming down,?to a set of chambers on the top
 floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was a label on
 the letter-box, "Return shortly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He hardly thought you'd come so soon," Mr. Wemmick explained. "You don't
 want me any more?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As I keep the cash," Mr. Wemmick observed, "we shall most likely meet
 pretty often. Good day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought
 I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting himself,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but
 said yes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have got so out of it!" said Mr. Wemmick,?"except at last. Very
 glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window
 and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it
 came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not put
 my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the
 Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking
 out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly
 maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name
 with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window,
 before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose before me
 the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of
 society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under each arm and a
 pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Pip?" said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Pocket?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a
 coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would
 come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,?not
 that that is any excuse,?for I thought, coming from the country, you
 might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market
 to get it good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head.
 I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this was a
 dream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear me!" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "This door sticks so!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
 the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold them.
 He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with the door
 as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last, that he
 staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and
 we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head,
 and as if this must be a dream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pray come in," said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "Allow me to lead the way. I am
 rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well
 till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through
 to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about
 London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our
 table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our
 coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense,
 such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's not by any
 means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasn't
 anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he had.
 This is our sitting-room,?just such chairs and tables and carpet and
 so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn't give me
 credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come for
 you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but
 Barnard's is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for the
 occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want
 anything, I'll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall be
 alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your
 pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take these
 bags from you. I am quite ashamed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,
 Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to
 be in mine, and he said, falling back,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And you," said I, "are the pale young gentleman!"
 </p><br>
 <p>

 <h2>
 Chapter XXII
 </h2>
 <p>
 The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in
 Barnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing. "The idea of its being
 you!" said he. "The idea of its being you!" said I. And then we
 contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. "Well!" said the pale
 young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, "it's all over now,
 I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me for having
 knocked you about so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the
 pale young gentleman's name) still rather confounded his intention with
 his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?" said Herbert
 Pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," he acquiesced: "I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather on
 the lookout for good fortune then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to
 me. But she couldn't,?at all events, she didn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bad taste," said Herbert, laughing, "but a fact. Yes, she had sent for me
 on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I
 should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been
 what-you-may-called it to Estella."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that?" I asked, with sudden gravity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his
 attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.
 "Affianced," he explained, still busy with the fruit. "Betrothed. Engaged.
 What's-his-named. Any word of that sort."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How did you bear your disappointment?" I asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pooh!" said he, "I didn't care much for it. She's a Tartar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and haughty
 and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss
 Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What relation is she to Miss Havisham?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "None," said he. "Only adopted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord, Mr. Pip!" said he. "Don't you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And now
 let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there,
 that day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out
 laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask him if
 he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?" he went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has her
 confidence when nobody else has?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with a
 constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in
 Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any
 other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen
 me there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he called
 on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father from his
 connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not
 that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he is a bad
 courtier and will not propitiate her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking. I
 had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more
 strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to
 do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about
 his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he
 would never be very successful or rich. I don't know how this was. I
 became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to
 dinner, but I cannot define by what means.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor
 about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem
 indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was
 better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure was
 a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
 liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young.
 Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on him than
 on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried off his
 rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad
 return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story, and
 laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. I
 further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country
 place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as
 a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a
 loss or going wrong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With pleasure," said he, "though I venture to prophesy that you'll want
 very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like
 to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour to
 begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my
 Christian name was Philip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't take to Philip," said he, smiling, "for it sounds like a moral
 boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or
 so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he
 locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a
 bird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
 neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you
 have been a blacksmith,?-would you mind it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't mind anything that you propose," I answered, "but I don't
 understand you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of
 music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I should like it very much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then, my dear Handel," said he, turning round as the door opened, "here
 is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because
 the dinner is of your providing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a
 nice little dinner,?seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,?and
 it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
 circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This
 again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet
 off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap
 of luxury,?being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,?the
 circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and
 shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting
 the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in
 the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the
 coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,?where
 I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I
 retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the
 waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his
 promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True," he replied. "I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,
 Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife
 in the mouth,?for fear of accidents,?and that while the fork
 is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is
 scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do.
 Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has two
 advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the object),
 and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part
 of the right elbow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both
 laughed and I scarcely blushed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," he pursued, "concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must
 know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her
 father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in your
 part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should be a crack
 thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot
 possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew.
 You see it every day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not on any account," returned Herbert; "but a public-house may keep a
 gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his
 daughter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham was an only child?" I hazarded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she
 had a half-brother. Her father privately married again?his cook, I
 rather think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought he was proud," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately, because
 he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead, I
 apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then the son
 became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted
 with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous, extravagant,
 undutiful,?altogether bad. At last his father disinherited him; but
 he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so
 well off as Miss Havisham.?Take another glass of wine, and excuse my
 mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly
 conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with
 the rim on one's nose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I thanked
 him, and apologized. He said, "Not at all," and resumed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as
 a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what with
 debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again. There
 were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between
 him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and
 mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father's anger. Now, I
 come to the cruel part of the story,?merely breaking off, my dear
 Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say.
 I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much
 better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within
 those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he said in the
 cheerfullest manner, "Not at all, I am sure!" and resumed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There appeared upon the scene?say at the races, or the public
 balls, or anywhere else you like?a certain man, who made love to
 Miss Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years
 ago, before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention
 that he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he
 was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman,
 my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that
 no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world
 began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain
 of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will
 express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and
 professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much
 susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed
 certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no doubt
 that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in that
 systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced
 her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been
 weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that when
 he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not
 at that time in Miss Havisham's counsels, and she was too haughty and too
 much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and
 scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not
 time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned
 her that she was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too
 unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily
 ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has
 never seen her since."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I thought of her having said, "Matthew will come and see me at last when I
 am laid dead upon that table;" and I asked Herbert whether his father was
 so inveterate against her?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not that," said he, "but she charged him, in the presence of her
 intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her
 for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would look
 true?even to him?and even to her. To return to the man and
 make an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were
 bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited.
 The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which she received," I struck in, "when she was dressing for her
 marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At the hour and minute," said Herbert, nodding, "at which she afterwards
 stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most
 heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't
 know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the
 whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since looked
 upon the light of day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that all the story?" I asked, after considering it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out
 for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss Havisham
 invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely
 requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one thing. It has been
 supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted
 throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it was a conspiracy
 between them; and that they shared the profits."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have
 been a part of her half-brother's scheme," said Herbert. "Mind! I don't
 know that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What became of the two men?" I asked, after again considering the
 subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They fell into deeper shame and degradation?if there can be deeper?and
 ruin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are they alive now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but
 adopted. When adopted?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Herbert shrugged his shoulders. "There has always been an Estella, since I
 have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel," said he,
 finally throwing off the story as it were, "there is a perfectly open
 understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And all that I know," I retorted, "you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between
 you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in
 life,?namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe
 it,?you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or
 even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done
 with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years and years
 to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he as
 perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood
 the fact myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for the
 purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and
 easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case.
 We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the course of
 conversation, what he was? He replied, "A capitalist,?an Insurer of
 Ships." I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some
 tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, "In the City."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the
 City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his
 back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible head open.
 But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that
 Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
 ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the
 Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these
 things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
 account. I think I shall trade," said he, leaning back in his chair, "to
 the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious
 woods. It's an interesting trade."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And the profits are large?" said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tremendous!" said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my
 own.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I shall trade, also," said he, putting his thumbs in his
 waist-coat pockets, "to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum. Also
 to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will want a good many ships," said I.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A perfect fleet," said he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him
 where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I haven't begun insuring yet," he replied. "I am looking about me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said
 (in a tone of conviction), "Ah-h!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is a counting-house profitable?" I asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To?do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?" he asked, in
 reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes; to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, n-no; not to me." He said this with the air of one carefully
 reckoning up and striking a balance. "Not directly profitable. That is, it
 doesn't pay me anything, and I have to?keep myself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if
 I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
 capital from such a source of income.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But the thing is," said Herbert Pocket, "that you look about you. That's
 the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a
 counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to
 his experience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then the time comes," said Herbert, "when you see your opening. And you
 go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you
 are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but
 employ it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;
 very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded to
 his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all blows
 and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then. It was
 evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries, for
 everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my
 account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming
 with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up. It was
 a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on
 famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went
 half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster
 Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who
 shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had
 left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook
 of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could
 have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very
 last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,
 geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so
 crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,
 there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old
 kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of
 some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under
 pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the
 counting-house to report himself,?to look about him, too, I suppose,?and
 I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to
 Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It appeared to me that the
 eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and
 heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those
 incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house
 where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory;
 being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all
 particulars, and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a
 look out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw fluey
 men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great
 merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be out of
 spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house
 which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject
 superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then,
 that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters'
 clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate
 price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we went back to
 Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for
 Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon,
 and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket's house. Lifting the latch
 of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river,
 where Mr. Pocket's children were playing about. And unless I deceive
 myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not
 concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up
 or being brought up, but were tumbling up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with her
 legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids were
 looking about them while the children played. "Mamma," said Herbert, "this
 is young Mr. Pip." Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance
 of amiable dignity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Master Alick and Miss Jane," cried one of the nurses to two of the
 children, "if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over
 into the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and
 said, "If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!" Upon which
 Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and settling herself
 in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed a
 knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week, but
 before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes upon me,
 and said, "I hope your mamma is quite well?" This unexpected inquiry put
 me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if
 there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite
 well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her
 compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, "if that don't make
 seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!" Mrs. Pocket
 received her property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if
 she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and
 said, "Thank you, Flopson," and forgot me, and went on reading.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than
 six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had
 scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region
 of air, wailing dolefully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If there ain't Baby!" said Flopson, appearing to think it most
 surprising. "Make haste up, Millers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees
 the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young
 ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the time,
 and I was curious to know what the book could be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any rate
 we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable
 family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs.
 Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over
 her,?always very much to her momentary astonishment, and their own
 more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for this surprising
 circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it,
 until by and by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to
 Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket, when she too went
 fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by
 Herbert and myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gracious me, Flopson!" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a
 moment, "everybody's tumbling!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gracious you, indeed, Mum!" returned Flopson, very red in the face; "what
 have you got there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I got here, Flopson?" asked Mrs. Pocket.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, if it ain't your footstool!" cried Flopson. "And if you keep it
 under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the baby,
 Mum, and give me your book."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little
 in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had lasted but
 a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were
 all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the second discovery
 on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted
 of alternately tumbling up and lying down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children
 into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out of
 it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.
 Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and
 with his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn't quite see
 his way to putting anything straight.

 Chapter XXIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to see
 him. "For, I really am not," he added, with his son's smile, "an alarming
 personage." He was a young-looking man, in spite of his perplexities and
 his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite natural. I use the word
 natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic
 in his distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous
 but for his own perception that it was very near being so. When he had
 talked with me a little, he said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious
 contraction of his eyebrows, which were black and handsome, "Belinda, I
 hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?" And she looked up from her book, and
 said, "Yes." She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked
 me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water? As the question had no
 bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I
 consider it to have been thrown out, like her previous approaches, in
 general conversational condescension.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs. Pocket
 was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight, who
 had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have
 been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined opposition arising out
 of entirely personal motives,?I forget whose, if I ever knew,?the
 Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord Chancellor's, the Archbishop
 of Canterbury's, anybody's,?and had tacked himself on to the nobles
 of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact. I believe he had
 been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the
 pen, in a desperate address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the
 laying of the first stone of some building or other, and for handing some
 Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had
 directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the
 nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the
 acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by
 this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but
 perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed, in
 the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was also
 in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the
 Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the one or the
 other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by
 the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted
 cutting), and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent.
 The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but his
 blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short
 struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was "a treasure for a
 Prince." Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince's treasure in the ways of the
 world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought him in but
 indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a
 queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married a title; while
 Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because
 he had never got one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a
 pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my
 own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other
 similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and
 Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of
 architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance, was
 reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
 exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
 else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house
 and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the
 servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving
 trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants
 felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
 drinking, and to keep a deal of company down stairs. They allowed a very
 liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by
 far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the
 kitchen,?always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,
 before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family
 were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers
 slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into
 tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing
 that the neighbors couldn't mind their own business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been
 educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself;
 but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early
 in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a
 Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,?of whom it was
 remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to help
 him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the
 Grindstone,?he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London.
 Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had "read" with divers
 who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers
 others for special occasions, and had turned his acquirements to the
 account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means, added
 to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the house I saw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly
 sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and
 shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This
 lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to
 dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the
 stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should
 be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him. That did
 not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence (at that
 time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if they were all
 like Me, it would be quite another thing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But dear Mrs. Pocket," said Mrs. Coiler, "after her early disappointment
 (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires so much luxury
 and elegance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am," I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to cry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And she is of so aristocratic a disposition?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, ma'am," I said again, with the same object as before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?That it is hard," said Mrs. Coiler, "to have dear Mr. Pocket's
 time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time
 and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing, and
 indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
 manners.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and
 Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and
 other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian name
 was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It further
 appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was
 all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa
 would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all. Drummle didn't
 say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow)
 he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a
 sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed
 any interest in this part of the conversation, and it appeared to me that
 it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time, when the
 page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in
 effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I
 now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through
 a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no
 impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as
 the rest. He laid down the carving-knife and fork,?being engaged in
 carving, at the moment,?put his two hands into his disturbed hair,
 and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.
 When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly
 went on with what he was about.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked it
 for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure
 was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she
 pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had
 left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when she made an
 occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to her), or upon
 Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on the opposite
 side of the table.

 After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring
 comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,?a sagacious way of
 improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys,
 besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor
 who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much
 as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting
 somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at
 the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had
 had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what to
 make of them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby," said Flopson. "Don't
 take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon the
 table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum," said Flopson; "and Miss Jane, come and
 dance to baby, do!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken
 upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place by me,
 and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and laughed.
 Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the meantime had
 twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair) laughed, and we all
 laughed and were glad.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,
 then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers to
 play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that
 the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes, and
 sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the two nurses
 left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated
 page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons
 at the gaming-table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a
 discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced
 orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on
 her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At length
 little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly left her
 place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away.
 Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time, and not approving
 of this, said to Jane,?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mamma dear," lisped the little girl, "baby ood have put hith eyeth out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How dare you tell me so?" retorted Mrs. Pocket. "Go and sit down in your
 chair this moment!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if I
 myself had done something to rouse it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Belinda," remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table, "how
 can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection of
 baby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will not allow anybody to interfere," said Mrs. Pocket. "I am
 surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
 interference."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good God!" cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation. "Are
 infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will not be interfered with by Jane," said Mrs. Pocket, with a majestic
 glance at that innocent little offender. "I hope I know my poor
 grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did lift
 himself some inches out of his chair. "Hear this!" he helplessly exclaimed
 to the elements. "Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for people's poor
 grandpapa's positions!" Then he let himself down again, and became silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A pause
 succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of
 leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the only member
 of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had any decided
 acquaintance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Drummle," said Mrs. Pocket, "will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you
 undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with ma!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It
 doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair
 of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft
 face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained
 its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few minutes,
 being nursed by little Jane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
 dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and their
 not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the mutual
 relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the
 following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face
 heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if he
 couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that
 establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on somebody
 else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions,?as
 why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa, Flopson was going
 to mend it when she had time,?and how little Fanny came by that
 whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn't
 forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling
 apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with one
 very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the
 hopeless subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had
 each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was
 pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as I
 was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,?not to
 say for other waters,?I at once engaged to place myself under the
 tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to
 whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused
 me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have
 known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would
 have paid it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should
 all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic
 occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and
 said, "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Speak to your master?" said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again.
 "How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to
