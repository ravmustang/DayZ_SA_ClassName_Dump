</p><br>

<p id="id00088">Ber.<br>

I have seen nothing.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00089">Mar.<br>

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br>

And will not let belief take hold of him<br>

Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>

Therefore I have entreated him along<br>

With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>

That, if again this apparition come<br>

He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00090">Hor.<br>

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00091">Ber.<br>

What we two nights have seen.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00092">Hor.<br>

Well, sit we down,<br>

And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00093">Ber.<br>

Last night of all,<br>

When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br>

Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br>

Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>

The bell then beating one,???<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00094">Mar.<br>

Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00095">[Enter Ghost, armed.]</p><br>

<p id="id00099">Hor.<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00100">Ber.<br>

It would be spoke to.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00101">Mar.<br>

Question it, Horatio.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00102">Hor.<br>

What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,<br>

Together with that fair and warlike form<br>

In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>

Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00103">Mar.<br>

It is offended.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00104">Ber.<br>

See, it stalks away!<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00106">[Exit Ghost.]</p><br>

<p id="id00107">Mar.<br>

'Tis gone, and will not answer.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00108">Ber.<br>

How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:<br>

Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>

What think you on't?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00109">Hor.<br>

Before my God, I might not this believe<br>

Without the sensible and true avouch<br>

Of mine own eyes.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00110">Mar.<br>

Is it not like the King?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00111">Hor.<br>

As thou art to thyself:<br>

Such was the very armour he had on<br>

When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br>

So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,<br>

He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>

'Tis strange.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00112">Mar.<br>

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br>

With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00113">Hor.<br>

In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>

But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>

This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00114">Mar.<br>

Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br>

Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>

So nightly toils the subject of the land;<br>

And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>

And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>

Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>

Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>

What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>

Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>

Who is't that can inform me?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00115">Hor.<br>

That can I;<br>

At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>

Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>

Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>

Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br>

Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,???<br>

For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,???<br>

Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,<br>

Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>

Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,<br>

Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:<br>

Against the which, a moiety competent<br>

Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>

To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>

Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,<br>

And carriage of the article design'd,<br>

His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>

Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>

Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br>

Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>

For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>

That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,???<br>

As it doth well appear unto our state,???<br>

But to recover of us, by strong hand,<br>

And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>

So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>

Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>

The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br>

Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00116">Ber.<br>

I think it be no other but e'en so:<br>

Well may it sort, that this portentous figure<br>

Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>

That was and is the question of these wars.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00117">Hor.<br>

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>

In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>

A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>

The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>

Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br>

As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>

Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,<br>

Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,<br>

Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>

And even the like precurse of fierce events,???<br>

As harbingers preceding still the fates,<br>

And prologue to the omen coming on,???<br>

Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>

Unto our climature and countrymen.???<br>

But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00118">[Re-enter Ghost.]</p><br>

<p id="id00119">I'll cross it, though it blast me.???Stay, illusion!<br>

If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>

Speak to me:<br>

If there be any good thing to be done,<br>

That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,<br>

Speak to me:<br>

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br>

Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,<br>

O, speak!<br>

Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>

Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>

For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>

[The cock crows.]<br>

Speak of it:???stay, and speak!???Stop it, Marcellus!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00120">Mar.<br>

Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00121">Hor.<br>

Do, if it will not stand.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00122">Ber.<br>

'Tis here!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00123">Hor.<br>

'Tis here!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00124">Mar.<br>

'Tis gone!<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00125">[Exit Ghost.]</p><br>

<p id="id00126">We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>

To offer it the show of violence;<br>

For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br>

And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00127">Ber.<br>

It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00128">Hor.<br>

And then it started, like a guilty thing<br>

Upon a fearful summons. I have heard<br>

The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>

Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>

Awake the god of day; and at his warning,<br>

Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>

The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>

To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>

This present object made probation.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00129">Mar.<br>

It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>

Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br>

Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br>

The bird of dawning singeth all night long;<br>

And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;<br>

The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br>

No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;<br>

So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00130">Hor.<br>

So have I heard, and do in part believe it.<br>

But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>

Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>

Break we our watch up: and by my advice,<br>

Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>

Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>

This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:<br>

Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>

As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00131">Mar.<br>

Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know<br>

Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br>

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>

The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>

To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom<br>

To be contracted in one brow of woe;<br>

Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>

That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br>

Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>

Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>

Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>

Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,???<br>

With an auspicious and one dropping eye,<br>

With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br>

In equal scale weighing delight and dole,???<br>

Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd<br>

Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>

With this affair along:???or all, our thanks.<br>

Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>

Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>

Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>

Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>

Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,<br>

He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,<br>

Importing the surrender of those lands<br>

Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>

To our most valiant brother. So much for him,???<br>

Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>

Thus much the business is:???we have here writ<br>

To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,???<br>

Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>

Of this his nephew's purpose,???to suppress<br>

His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br>

The lists, and full proportions are all made<br>

Out of his subject:???and we here dispatch<br>

You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>

For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>

Giving to you no further personal power<br>

To business with the king, more than the scope<br>

Of these dilated articles allow.<br>

Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00136">Cor. and Volt.<br>

In that and all things will we show our duty.<br>

<p id="id00138">[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]</p><br>

<p id="id00139">And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?<br>

You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?<br>

You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br>

And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>

That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>

The head is not more native to the heart,<br>

The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>

Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>

What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br>

<p id="id00140">Laer.<br>

My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,<br>

And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00142">Pol.<br>

By laboursome petition; and at last<br>

Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:<br>

I do beseech you, give him leave to go.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00143">King.<br>

And thy best graces spend it at thy will!???<br>

But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son???<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00148">Ham.<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00149">Queen.<br>

If it be,<br>

Why seems it so particular with thee?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00150">Ham.<br>

Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.<br>

'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>

Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>

Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,<br>

No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>

Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,<br>

Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,<br>

That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;<br>

For they are actions that a man might play;<br>

But I have that within which passeth show;<br>

These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00151">King.<br>

'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br>

To give these mourning duties to your father;<br>

But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br>

That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,<br>

In filial obligation, for some term<br>

To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere<br>

In obstinate condolement is a course<br>

Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;<br>

It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;<br>

A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;<br>

An understanding simple and unschool'd;<br>

For what we know must be, and is as common<br>

As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>

Why should we, in our peevish opposition,<br>

Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>

A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>

To reason most absurd; whose common theme<br>

Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>

From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>

'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth<br>

This unprevailing woe; and think of us<br>

As of a father: for let the world take note<br>

You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>

And with no less nobility of love<br>

Than that which dearest father bears his son<br>

Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>

In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>

It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>

And we beseech you bend you to remain<br>

Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>

Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00152">Queen.<br>

Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>

I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00153">Ham.<br>

I shall in all my best obey you, madam.<br>
</p><br>

In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br>

Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,<br>

Appears before them and with solemn march<br>

Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd<br>

By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br>

Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd<br>

Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>

Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me<br>

For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>

In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,<br>

Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;<br>

And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>

The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>

His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>

For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>

He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,<br>

Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>

The safety and health of this whole state;<br>

And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd<br>

Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>

Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>

It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>

As he in his particular act and place<br>

May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>

Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>

Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain<br>

And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>

If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>

Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:<br>

The canker galls the infants of the spring<br>

Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:<br>

And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>

Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>

Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware<br>

Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,<br>

Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>

Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:<br>

Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>

Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>

For the apparel oft proclaims the man;<br>

Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid<br>

Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;<br>

Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;<br>

Thy knotted and combined locks to part,<br>

And each particular hair to stand on end<br>

Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:<br>

But this eternal blazon must not be<br>

The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br>

O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>

From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>

That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>

I made to her in marriage; and to decline<br>

Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>

To those of mine!<br>

But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,<br>

Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;<br>

So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br>

Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br>

And prey on garbage.<br>

But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>

Brief let me be.???Sleeping within my orchard,<br>

My custom always of the afternoon,<br>

Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>

With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>

And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>

The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>

Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>

That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through<br>

The natural gates and alleys of the body;<br>

And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br>

And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>

The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;<br>

And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br>

Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust<br>

Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,<br>

Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:<br>

Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>

Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;<br>

No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>

With all my imperfections on my head:<br>

O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>

A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>

But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,<br>

Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>

Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,<br>

And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>

To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>

As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;<br>

At last,???a little shaking of mine arm,<br>

And thrice his head thus waving up and down,???<br>

He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound<br>

As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>

And end his being: that done, he lets me go:<br>

And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd<br>

The need we have to use you did provoke<br>

Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br>

Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,<br>

Since nor the exterior nor the inward man<br>

Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br>

More than his father's death, that thus hath put him<br>

So much from the understanding of himself,<br>

I cannot dream of: I entreat you both<br>

That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br>

And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,<br>

That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br>

Some little time: so by your companies<br>

To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br>

So much as from occasion you may glean,<br>

Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br>

That, open'd, lies within our remedy.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00407">Queen.<br>

Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,<br>

And sure I am two men there are not living<br>

To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br>

To show us so much gentry and good-will<br>

As to expend your time with us awhile,<br>

For the supply and profit of our hope,<br>

Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br>

As fits a king's remembrance.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00408">Ros.<br>

Both your majesties<br>

Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br>

Put your dread pleasures more into command<br>

Than to entreaty.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00409">Guil.<br>

We both obey,<br>

And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,<br>

To lay our service freely at your feet,<br>

To be commanded.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00410">King.<br>

Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00411">Queen.<br>

And I beseech you instantly to visit<br>

My too-much-changed son.???Go, some of you,<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00428">Volt.<br>

Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br>

Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br>

His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd<br>

Makes vow before his uncle never more<br>

And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br>

So levied as before, against the Polack:<br>

With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br>

That it might please you to give quiet pass<br>

Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br>

And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br>

But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br>

That we find out the cause of this effect;<br>

Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br>

For this effect defective comes by cause:<br>

Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.<br>

[Reads.]<br>

'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified<br>

Ophelia,'???<br>

That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile<br>

phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:<br>

[Reads.]<br>

'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00434">Queen.<br>

Came this from Hamlet to her?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00435">Pol.<br>

Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.<br>

[Reads.]<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;'Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt that the sun doth move;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt truth to be a liar;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never doubt I love.<br>

'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to<br>

reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe<br>

it. Adieu.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAMLET.'<br>

This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;<br>

And more above, hath his solicitings,<br>

As they fell out by time, by means, and place,<br>

All given to mine ear.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00436">King.<br>

But how hath she<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00437">Pol.<br>

What do you think of me?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00438">King.<br>

As of a man faithful and honourable.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00439">Pol.<br>

I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br>

When I had seen this hot love on the wing,???<br>

As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,<br>

Before my daughter told me,??? what might you,<br>

Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br>

If I had play'd the desk or table-book,<br>

Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;<br>

Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;???<br>

What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br>

And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br>

'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;<br>

This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,<br>

That she should lock herself from his resort,<br>

Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br>

Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br>

And he, repulsed,???a short tale to make,???<br>

Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;<br>

Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;<br>

Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,<br>

Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br>

And all we wail for.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00440">King.<br>

Do you think 'tis this?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00441">Queen.<br>

It may be, very likely.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00442">Pol.<br>

Hath there been such a time,???I'd fain know that???<br>

That I have positively said ''Tis so,'<br>

When it prov'd otherwise?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00443">King.<br>

Not that I know.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00444">Pol.<br>

Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br>

<p id="id00448">Pol.<br>

At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:<br>

Be you and I behind an arras then;<br>

And he not from his reason fall'n thereon<br>

</p><br>

<p id="id00470">Pol.<br>

I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00471">Ham.
Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.</p><br>

<p id="id00472">Pol.<br>

[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.???<br>

Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughter.???My honourable lord, I will most humbly take

question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,

hither?</p><br>

A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and

We think not so, my lord.<br>

<p id="id00499">Ham.
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.</p><br>

<p id="id00500">Ros.
Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
mind.</p><br>

<p id="id00501">Ham.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p><br>

<p id="id00502">Guil.
Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p><br>

<p id="id00503">Ham.<br>

A dream itself is but a shadow.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00504">Ros.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadow's shadow.</p><br>

<p id="id00505">Ham.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my

No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my

dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
make you at Elsinore?</p><br>

<p id="id00508">Ros.<br>

<p id="id00509">Ham.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p><br>

<p id="id00510">Guil.<br>

What should we say, my lord?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00511">Ham.
Why, anything???but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.</p><br>

<p id="id00512">Ros.<br>

To what end, my lord?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00513">Ham.
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
me, whether you were sent for or no.</p><br>

<p id="id00514">Ros.<br>

[To Guildenstern.] What say you?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00515">Ham.
[Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.???If you love me, hold
not off.</p><br>

<p id="id00516">Guil.<br>

My lord, we were sent for.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00517">Ham.
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
feather. I have of late,???but wherefore I know not,???lost all my
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire,???why, it appears no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in
faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in
action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</p><br>

<p id="id00518">Ros.<br>

My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00519">Ham.<br>

Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00520">Ros.
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them
on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.</p><br>

<p id="id00521">Ham.
He that plays the king shall be welcome,???his majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
they?</p><br>

<p id="id00522">Ros.
Even those you were wont to take such delight in,???the
tragedians of the city.</p><br>

<p id="id00523">Ham.
How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p><br>

<p id="id00524">Ros.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.</p><br>

<p id="id00525">Ham.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city? Are they so followed?</p><br>

<p id="id00526">Ros.<br>

No, indeed, are they not.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00527">Ham.<br>

How comes it? do they grow rusty?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00528">Ros.
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are
now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,???so they call
them,???that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
dare scarce come thither.</p><br>

<p id="id00529">Ham.
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
themselves to common players,???as it is most like, if their means
are no better,???their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession?</p><br>

<p id="id00530">Ros.
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.</p><br>

<p id="id00531">Ham.<br>

Is't possible?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00532">Guil.<br>

O, there has been much throwing about of brains.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00533">Ham.<br>

Do the boys carry it away?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00534">Ros.<br>

Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00535">Ham.
It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in
little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
philosophy could find it out.</p><br>

appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply

The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,

Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are

<p id="id00565">Ham.
I heard thee speak me a speech once,???but it was never acted;
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased
not the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,???as I
received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine,???an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lend a tyrannous and a damned light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was declining on the milky head<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did nothing.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we often see, against some storm,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now falls on Priam.???<br>

Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>

And can say nothing; no, not for a king<br>

Upon whose property and most dear life<br>

A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>

Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>

Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?<br>

Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat<br>

As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?<br>

'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br>

Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>

O, vengeance!<br>

That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,<br>

And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br>

A scullion!<br>

That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,<br>

Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>

Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>

They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br>

For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>

With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players<br>

Play something like the murder of my father<br>

Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;<br>

I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>

I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>

May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br>

To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>

Out of my weakness and my melancholy,???<br>

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your
players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,
for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.</p><br>

Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
have seen play,???and heard others praise, and that highly,???not
to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably.</p><br>

speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous
and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go

The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent me to you.</p><br>

You are welcome.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00778">Guil.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.</p><br>

<p id="id00779">Ham.<br>

Sir, I cannot.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00780">Guil.<br>

What, my lord?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id00781">Ham.
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
say,???</p><br>

<p id="id00782">Ros.

further trade with us?</p><br>

<p id="id00788">Ros.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
your friend.</p><br>

<p id="id00789">Ham.<br>

Sir, I lack advancement.<br>

'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your

discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.</p><br>

<p id="id00802">Guil.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I
have not the skill.</p><br>

<p id="id00803">Ham.
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a

Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense<br>

Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;<br>

Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;<br>

Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;<br>

And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br>

Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,<br>

Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br>

That I essentially am not in madness,<br>

But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;<br>

For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br>

Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br>

Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?<br>

No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br>

Unpeg the basket on the house's top,<br>

Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,<br>

To try conclusions, in the basket creep<br>

And break your own neck down.<br>
</p><br>

For 'tis the sport to have the enginer<br>

Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard<br>

But I will delve one yard below their mines<br>

And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,<br>

This man shall set me packing:<br>

I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.???<br>

Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,

letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for
them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.

Why to a public count I might not go,<br>

Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br>

Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br>

Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br>

Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br>

Here was a gentleman of Normandy,???<br>

I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,<br>

Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;<br>

And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br>

As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd<br>

That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed<br>

<p id="id01144">Laer.<br>

Why ask you this?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01145">King.<br>

Not that I think you did not love your father;<br>

But that I know love is begun by time,<br>

And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>

Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>

There lives within the very flame of love<br>

A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br>

And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>

For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br>

Dies in his own too much: that we would do,<br>

We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,<br>

And hath abatements and delays as many<br>

As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>

And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>

That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:???<br>

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake<br>

To show yourself your father's son in deed<br>

More than in words?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01146">Laer.<br>

To cut his throat i' the church.<br>

Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>

Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br>

Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:<br>

We'll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>

And set a double varnish on the fame<br>

The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together<br>

And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br>

Most generous, and free from all contriving,<br>

Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,<br>

Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>

A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,<br>

Requite him for your father.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01148">Laer.<br>

I will do't:<br>

And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.<br>

I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br>

So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>

Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>

Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>

With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br>

<p id="id01163">[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &amp;c.]</p><br>

<p id="id01164">1 Clown.
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
seeks her own salvation?</p><br>

<p id="id01165">2 Clown.
I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.</p><br>

<p id="id01166">1 Clown.
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?</p><br>

<p id="id01167">2 Clown.
Why, 'tis found so.</p><br>

<p id="id01168">1 Clown.
It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
argal, she drowned herself wittingly.</p><br>

<p id="id01169">2 Clown.
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,???</p><br>

<p id="id01170">1 Clown.
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the
man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
will he, nill he, he goes,???mark you that: but if the water come
to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p><br>

<p id="id01171">2 Clown.
But is this law?</p><br>

<p id="id01172">1 Clown.
Ay, marry, is't???crowner's quest law.</p><br>

<p id="id01173">2 Clown.
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.</p><br>

<p id="id01174">1 Clown.
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
more than their even Christian.???Come, my spade. There is no
ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
hold up Adam's profession.</p><br>

<p id="id01175">2 Clown.
Was he a gentleman?</p><br>

<p id="id01176">1 Clown.
He was the first that ever bore arms.</p><br>

<p id="id01177">2 Clown.
Why, he had none.</p><br>

<p id="id01178">1 Clown.
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself,???</p><br>

<p id="id01179">2 Clown.
Go to.</p><br>

<p id="id01180">1 Clown.
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
shipwright, or the carpenter?</p><br>

<p id="id01181">2 Clown.
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.</p><br>

<p id="id01182">1 Clown.
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</p><br>

<p id="id01183">2 Clown.
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?</p><br>

<p id="id01184">1 Clown.
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</p><br>

<p id="id01185">2 Clown.
Marry, now I can tell.</p><br>

now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
 Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

Which was the model of that Danish seal:<br>

Folded the writ up in the form of the other;<br>

Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,<br>

The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br>

Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br>

And with such cozenage???is't not perfect conscience<br>

To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd<br>

To let this canker of our nature come<br>

The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:<br>

Into a towering passion.<br>

<p id="id01321">Osr.
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,???as 'twere???I cannot

he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the

I beseech you, remember,???<br>

[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01323">Osr.
Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p><br>

<p id="id01324">Ham.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;???though, I
know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p><br>

<p id="id01325">Osr.<br>

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01326">Ham.

rawer breath?</p><br>

Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
sir, really.</p><br>

</p><br>

<p id="id01330">Osr.<br>

Of Laertes?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01331">Hor.<br>

His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01332">Ham.<br>

Of him, sir.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01333">Osr.<br>

I know, you are not ignorant,???<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01334">Ham.
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
much approve me.???Well, sir.</p><br>

<p id="id01335">Osr.<br>

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,???<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01336">Ham.
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.</p><br>

<p id="id01337">Osr.
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</p><br>

<p id="id01338">Ham.<br>

What's his weapon?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01339">Osr.<br>

Rapier and dagger.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01340">Ham.<br>

That's two of his weapons:???but well.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01341">Osr.
The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
very liberal conceit.</p><br>

<p id="id01342">Ham.<br>

What call you the carriages?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01343">Hor.<br>

I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01344">Osr.<br>

The carriages, sir, are the hangers.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01345">Ham.
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French
bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?</p><br>

<p id="id01346">Osr.
The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p><br>

<p id="id01347">Ham.<br>

How if I answer no?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01348">Osr.<br>

I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01349">Ham.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be
brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits.</p><br>

<p id="id01350">Osr.<br>

Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01351">Ham.<br>

To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01352">Osr.<br>

I commend my duty to your lordship.<br>

To the ambassadors of England gives<br>

This warlike volley.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01449">Ham.<br>

O, I die, Horatio;<br>

The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:<br>

I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br>

But I do prophesy the election lights<br>

On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br>

So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br>

Which have solicited.???the rest is silence.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01450">[Dies.]</p><br>

<p id="id01451">Hor.<br>

Now cracks a noble heart.???Good night, sweet prince,<br>

And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br>

Why does the drum come hither?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01452">[March within.]</p><br>

<p id="id01453">[Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]</p><br>

<p id="id01454">Fort.<br>

Where is this sight?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01455">Hor.<br>

What is it you will see?<br>

If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01456">Fort.<br>

This quarry cries on havoc.???O proud death,<br>

What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br>

That thou so many princes at a shot<br>

So bloodily hast struck?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01457">1 Ambassador.<br>

The sight is dismal;<br>

And our affairs from England come too late:<br>

The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br>

To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd<br>

That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br>

Where should we have our thanks?<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01458">Hor.<br>

Not from his mouth,<br>

Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br>

He never gave commandment for their death.<br>

But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br>

You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br>

Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies<br>

High on a stage be placed to the view;<br>

And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br>

How these things came about: so shall you hear<br>

Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;<br>

Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;<br>

Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;<br>

And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br>

Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I<br>

Truly deliver.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01459">Fort.<br>

Let us haste to hear it,<br>

And call the noblest to the audience.<br>

For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br>

I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br>

Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01460">Hor.<br>

Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br>

And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:<br>

But let this same be presently perform'd,<br>

Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance<br>

On plots and errors happen.<br>
</p><br>

<p id="id01461">Fort.<br>

Let four captains<br>

Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;<br>

For he was likely, had he been put on,<br>

To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,<br>

The soldiers' music and the rites of war<br>

Speak loudly for him.???<b
