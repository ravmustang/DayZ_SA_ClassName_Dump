 <h2>
 Introduction.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Had Rabelais never written his strange and marvellous romance, no one
 would ever have imagined the possibility of its production. It stands
 outside other things?a mixture of mad mirth and gravity, of folly
 and reason, of childishness and grandeur, of the commonplace and the
 out-of-the-way, of popular verve and polished humanism, of mother-wit and
 learning, of baseness and nobility, of personalities and broad
 generalization, of the comic and the serious, of the impossible and the
 familiar. Throughout the whole there is such a force of life and thought,
 such a power of good sense, a kind of assurance so authoritative, that he
 takes rank with the greatest; and his peers are not many. You may like him
 or not, may attack him or sing his praises, but you cannot ignore him. He
 is of those that die hard. Be as fastidious as you will; make up your mind
 to recognize only those who are, without any manner of doubt, beyond and
 above all others; however few the names you keep, Rabelais' will always
 remain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We may know his work, may know it well, and admire it more every time we
 read it. After being amused by it, after having enjoyed it, we may return
 again to study it and to enter more fully into its meaning. Yet there is
 no possibility of knowing his own life in the same fashion. In spite of
 all the efforts, often successful, that have been made to throw light on
 it, to bring forward a fresh document, or some obscure mention in a
 forgotten book, to add some little fact, to fix a date more precisely, it
 remains nevertheless full of uncertainty and of gaps. Besides, it has been
 burdened and sullied by all kinds of wearisome stories and foolish
 anecdotes, so that really there is more to weed out than to add.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This injustice, at first wilful, had its rise in the sixteenth century, in
 the furious attacks of a monk of Fontevrault, Gabriel de Puy-Herbault, who
 seems to have drawn his conclusions concerning the author from the book,
 and, more especially, in the regrettable satirical epitaph of Ronsard,
 piqued, it is said, that the Guises had given him only a little pavillon
 in the Forest of Meudon, whereas the presbytery was close to the chateau.
 From that time legend has fastened on Rabelais, has completely travestied
 him, till, bit by bit, it has made of him a buffoon, a veritable clown, a
 vagrant, a glutton, and a drunkard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The likeness of his person has undergone a similar metamorphosis. He has
 been credited with a full moon of a face, the rubicund nose of an
 incorrigible toper, and thick coarse lips always apart because always
 laughing. The picture would have surprised his friends no less than
 himself. There have been portraits painted of Rabelais; I have seen many
 such. They are all of the seventeenth century, and the greater number are
 conceived in this jovial and popular style.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As a matter of fact there is only one portrait of him that counts, that
 has more than the merest chance of being authentic, the one in the
 Chronologie collee or coupee. Under this double name is known and cited a
 large sheet divided by lines and cross lines into little squares,
 containing about a hundred heads of illustrious Frenchmen. This sheet was
 stuck on pasteboard for hanging on the wall, and was cut in little pieces,
 so that the portraits might be sold separately. The majority of the
 portraits are of known persons and can therefore be verified. Now it can
 be seen that these have been selected with care, and taken from the most
 authentic sources; from statues, busts, medals, even stained glass, for
 the persons of most distinction, from earlier engravings for the others.
 Moreover, those of which no other copies exist, and which are therefore
 the most valuable, have each an individuality very distinct, in the
 features, the hair, the beard, as well as in the costume. Not one of them
 is like another. There has been no tampering with them, no forgery. On the
 contrary, there is in each a difference, a very marked personality.
 Leonard Gaultier, who published this engraving towards the end of the
 sixteenth century, reproduced a great many portraits besides from chalk
 drawings, in the style of his master, Thomas de Leu. It must have been
 such drawings that were the originals of those portraits which he alone
 has issued, and which may therefore be as authentic and reliable as the
 others whose correctness we are in a position to verify.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now Rabelais has here nothing of the Roger Bontemps of low degree about
 him. His features are strong, vigorously cut, and furrowed with deep
 wrinkles; his beard is short and scanty; his cheeks are thin and already
 worn-looking. On his head he wears the square cap of the doctors and the
 clerks, and his dominant expression, somewhat rigid and severe, is that of
 a physician and a scholar. And this is the only portrait to which we need
 attach any importance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This is not the place for a detailed biography, nor for an exhaustive
 study. At most this introduction will serve as a framework on which to fix
 a few certain dates, to hang some general observations. The date of
 Rabelais' birth is very doubtful. For long it was placed as far back as
 1483: now scholars are disposed to put it forward to about 1495. The
 reason, a good one, is that all those whom he has mentioned as his
 friends, or in any real sense his contemporaries, were born at the very
 end of the fifteenth century. And, indeed, it is in the references in his
 romance to names, persons, and places, that the most certain and valuable
 evidence is to be found of his intercourse, his patrons, his friendships,
 his sojournings, and his travels: his own work is the best and richest
 mine in which to search for the details of his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like Descartes and Balzac, he was a native of Touraine, and Tours and
 Chinon have only done their duty in each of them erecting in recent years
 a statue to his honour, a twofold homage reflecting credit both on the
 province and on the town. But the precise facts about his birth are
 nevertheless vague. Huet speaks of the village of Benais, near Bourgeuil,
 of whose vineyards Rabelais makes mention. As the little vineyard of La
 Deviniere, near Chinon, and familiar to all his readers, is supposed to
 have belonged to his father, Thomas Rabelais, some would have him born
 there. It is better to hold to the earlier general opinion that Chinon was
 his native town; Chinon, whose praises he sang with such heartiness and
 affection. There he might well have been born in the Lamproie house, which
 belonged to his father, who, to judge from this circumstance, must have
 been in easy circumstances, with the position of a well-to-do citizen. As
 La Lamproie in the seventeenth century was a hostelry, the father of
 Rabelais has been set down as an innkeeper. More probably he was an
 apothecary, which would fit in with the medical profession adopted by his
 son in after years. Rabelais had brothers, all older than himself. Perhaps
 because he was the youngest, his father destined him for the Church.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The time he spent while a child with the Benedictine monks at Seuille is
 uncertain. There he might have made the acquaintance of the prototype of
 his Friar John, a brother of the name of Buinart, afterwards Prior of
 Sermaize. He was longer at the Abbey of the Cordeliers at La Baumette,
 half a mile from Angers, where he became a novice. As the brothers Du
 Bellay, who were later his Maecenases, were then studying at the
 University of Angers, where it is certain he was not a student, it is
 doubtless from this youthful period that his acquaintance and alliance
 with them should date. Voluntarily, or induced by his family, Rabelais now
 embraced the ecclesiastical profession, and entered the monastery of the
 Franciscan Cordeliers at Fontenay-le-Comte, in Lower Poitou, which was
 honoured by his long sojourn at the vital period of his life when his
 powers were ripening. There it was he began to study and to think, and
 there also began his troubles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In spite of the wide-spread ignorance among the monks of that age, the
 encyclopaedic movement of the Renaissance was attracting all the lofty
 minds. Rabelais threw himself into it with enthusiasm, and Latin antiquity
 was not enough for him. Greek, a study discountenanced by the Church,
 which looked on it as dangerous and tending to freethought and heresy,
 took possession of him. To it he owed the warm friendship of Pierre Amy
 and of the celebrated Guillaume Bude. In fact, the Greek letters of the
 latter are the best source of information concerning this period of
 Rabelais' life. It was at Fontenay-le-Comte also that he became acquainted
 with the Brissons and the great jurist Andre Tiraqueau, whom he never
 mentions but with admiration and deep affection. Tiraqueau's treatise, De
 legibus connubialibus, published for the first time in 1513, has an
 important bearing on the life of Rabelais. There we learn that,
 dissatisfied with the incomplete translation of Herodotus by Laurent
 Valla, Rabelais had retranslated into Latin the first book of the History.
 That translation unfortunately is lost, as so many other of his scattered
 works. It is probably in this direction that the hazard of fortune has
 most discoveries and surprises in store for the lucky searcher. Moreover,
 as in this law treatise Tiraqueau attacked women in a merciless fashion,
 President Amaury Bouchard published in 1522 a book in their defence, and
 Rabelais, who was a friend of both the antagonists, took the side of
 Tiraqueau. It should be observed also in passing, that there are several
 pages of such audacious plain-speaking, that Rabelais, though he did not
 copy these in his Marriage of Panurge, has there been, in his own fashion,
 as out spoken as Tiraqueau. If such freedom of language could be permitted
 in a grave treatise of law, similar liberties were certainly, in the same
 century, more natural in a book which was meant to amuse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The great reproach always brought against Rabelais is not the want of
 reserve of his language merely, but his occasional studied coarseness,
 which is enough to spoil his whole work, and which lowers its value. La
 Bruyere, in the chapter Des ouvrages de l'esprit, not in the first edition
 of the Caracteres, but in the fifth, that is to say in 1690, at the end of
 the great century, gives us on this subject his own opinion and that of
 his age:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Marot and Rabelais are inexcusable in their habit of scattering filth
 about their writings. Both of them had genius enough and wit enough to do
 without any such expedient, even for the amusement of those persons who
 look more to the laugh to be got out of a book than to what is admirable
 in it. Rabelais especially is incomprehensible. His book is an enigma,?one
 may say inexplicable. It is a Chimera; it is like the face of a lovely
 woman with the feet and the tail of a reptile, or of some creature still
 more loathsome. It is a monstrous confusion of fine and rare morality with
 filthy corruption. Where it is bad, it goes beyond the worst; it is the
 delight of the basest of men. Where it is good, it reaches the exquisite,
 the very best; it ministers to the most delicate tastes.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Putting aside the rather slight connection established between two men of
 whom one is of very little importance compared with the other, this is
 otherwise very admirably said, and the judgment is a very just one, except
 with regard to one point?the misunderstanding of the atmosphere in
 which the book was created, and the ignoring of the examples of a similar
 tendency furnished by literature as well as by the popular taste. Was it
 not the Ancients that began it? Aristophanes, Catullus, Petronius,
 Martial, flew in the face of decency in their ideas as well as in the
 words they used, and they dragged after them in this direction not a few
 of the Latin poets of the Renaissance, who believed themselves bound to
 imitate them. Is Italy without fault in this respect? Her story-tellers in
 prose lie open to easy accusation. Her Capitoli in verse go to incredible
 lengths; and the astonishing success of Aretino must not be forgotten, nor
 the licence of the whole Italian comic theatre of the sixteenth century.
 The Calandra of Bibbiena, who was afterwards a Cardinal, and the
 Mandragola of Machiavelli, are evidence enough, and these were played
 before Popes, who were not a whit embarrassed. Even in England the drama
 went very far for a time, and the comic authors of the reign of Charles
 II., evidently from a reaction, and to shake off the excess and the
 wearisomeness of Puritan prudery and affectation, which sent them to the
 opposite extreme, are not exactly noted for their reserve. But we need not
 go beyond France. Slight indications, very easily verified, are all that
 may be set down here; a formal and detailed proof would be altogether too
 dangerous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus, for instance, the old Fabliaux?the Farces of the fifteenth
 century, the story-tellers of the sixteenth?reveal one of the sides,
 one of the veins, so to speak, of our literature. The art that addresses
 itself to the eye had likewise its share of this coarseness. Think of the
 sculptures on the capitals and the modillions of churches, and the crude
 frankness of certain painted windows of the fifteenth century. Queen Anne
 was, without any doubt, one of the most virtuous women in the world. Yet
 she used to go up the staircase of her chateau at Blois, and her eyes were
 not offended at seeing at the foot of a bracket a not very decent carving
 of a monk and a nun. Neither did she tear out of her book of Hours the
 large miniature of the winter month, in which, careless of her neighbours'
 eyes, the mistress of the house, sitting before her great fireplace, warms
 herself in a fashion which it is not advisable that dames of our age
 should imitate. The statue of Cybele by the Tribolo, executed for Francis
 I., and placed, not against a wall, but in the middle of Queen Claude's
 chamber at Fontainebleau, has behind it an attribute which would have been
 more in place on a statue of Priapus, and which was the symbol of
 generativeness. The tone of the conversations was ordinarily of a
 surprising coarseness, and the Precieuses, in spite of their absurdities,
 did a very good work in setting themselves in opposition to it. The worthy
 Chevalier de La-Tour-Landry, in his Instructions to his own daughters,
 without a thought of harm, gives examples which are singular indeed, and
 in Caxton's translation these are not omitted. The Adevineaux Amoureux,
 printed at Bruges by Colard Mansion, are astonishing indeed when one
 considers that they were the little society diversions of the Duchesses of
 Burgundy and of the great ladies of a court more luxurious and more
 refined than the French court, which revelled in the Cent Nouvelles of
 good King Louis XI. Rabelais' pleasantry about the woman folle a la messe
 is exactly in the style of the Adevineaux.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A later work than any of his, the Novelle of Bandello, should be kept in
 mind?for the writer was Bishop of Agen, and his work was translated
 into French?as also the Dames Galantes of Brantome. Read the Journal
 of Heroard, that honest doctor, who day by day wrote down the details
 concerning the health of Louis XIII. from his birth, and you will
 understand the tone of the conversation of Henry IV. The jokes at a
 country wedding are trifles compared with this royal coarseness. Le Moyen
 de Parvenir is nothing but a tissue and a mass of filth, and the too
 celebrated Cabinet Satyrique proves what, under Louis XIII., could be
 written, printed, and read. The collection of songs formed by Clairambault
 shows that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were no purer than the
 sixteenth. Some of the most ribald songs are actually the work of
 Princesses of the royal House.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It is, therefore, altogether unjust to make Rabelais the scapegoat, to
 charge him alone with the sins of everybody else. He spoke as those of his
 time used to speak; when amusing them he used their language to make
 himself understood, and to slip in his asides, which without this sauce
 would never have been accepted, would have found neither eyes nor ears.
 Let us blame not him, therefore, but the manners of his time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides, his gaiety, however coarse it may appear to us?and how rare
 a thing is gaiety!?has, after all, nothing unwholesome about it; and
 this is too often overlooked. Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?
 Where, even indirectly, does he give pernicious advice? Whom has he led to
 evil ways? Does he ever inspire feelings that breed misconduct and vice,
 or is he ever the apologist of these? Many poets and romance writers,
 under cover of a fastidious style, without one coarse expression, have
 been really and actively hurtful; and of that it is impossible to accuse
 Rabelais. Women in particular quickly revolt from him, and turn away
 repulsed at once by the archaic form of the language and by the
 outspokenness of the words. But if he be read aloud to them, omitting the
 rougher parts and modernizing the pronunciation, it will be seen that they
 too are impressed by his lively wit as by the loftiness of his thought. It
 would be possible, too, to extract, for young persons, without
 modification, admirable passages of incomparable force. But those who have
 brought out expurgated editions of him, or who have thought to improve him
 by trying to rewrite him in modern French, have been fools for their
 pains, and their insulting attempts have had, and always will have, the
 success they deserve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His dedications prove to what extent his whole work was accepted. Not to
 speak of his epistolary relations with Bude, with the Cardinal d'Armagnac
 and with Pellissier, the ambassador of Francis I. and Bishop of
 Maguelonne, or of his dedication to Tiraqueau of his Lyons edition of the
 Epistolae Medicinales of Giovanni Manardi of Ferrara, of the one addressed
 to the President Amaury Bouchard of the two legal texts which he believed
 antique, there is still the evidence of his other and more important
 dedications. In 1532 he dedicated his Hippocrates and his Galen to
 Geoffroy d'Estissac, Bishop of Maillezais, to whom in 1535 and 1536 he
 addressed from Rome the three news letters, which alone have been
 preserved; and in 1534 he dedicated from Lyons his edition of the Latin
 book of Marliani on the topography of Rome to Jean du Bellay (at that time
 Bishop of Paris) who was raised to the Cardinalate in 1535. Beside these
 dedications we must set the privilege of Francis I. of September, 1545,
 and the new privilege granted by Henry II. on August 6th, 1550, Cardinal
 de Chatillon present, for the third book, which was dedicated, in an
 eight-lined stanza, to the Spirit of the Queen of Navarre. These
 privileges, from the praises and eulogies they express in terms very
 personal and very exceptional, are as important in Rabelais' life as were,
 in connection with other matters, the Apostolic Pastorals in his favour.
 Of course, in these the popes had not to introduce his books of
 diversions, which, nevertheless, would have seemed in their eyes but very
 venial sins. The Sciomachie of 1549, an account of the festivities
 arranged at Rome by Cardinal du Bellay in honour of the birth of the
 second son of Henry II., was addressed to Cardinal de Guise, and in 1552
 the fourth book was dedicated, in a new prologue, to Cardinal de
 Chatillon, the brother of Admiral de Coligny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These are no unknown or insignificant personages, but the greatest lords
 and princes of the Church. They loved and admired and protected Rabelais,
 and put no restrictions in his way. Why should we be more fastidious and
 severe than they were? Their high contemporary appreciation gives much
 food for thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There are few translations of Rabelais in foreign tongues; and certainly
 the task is no light one, and demands more than a familiarity with
 ordinary French. It would have been easier in Italy than anywhere else.
 Italian, from its flexibility and its analogy to French, would have lent
 itself admirably to the purpose; the instrument was ready, but the hand
 was not forthcoming. Neither is there any Spanish translation, a fact
 which can be more easily understood. The Inquisition would have been a far
 more serious opponent than the Paris' Sorbonne, and no one ventured on the
 experiment. Yet Rabelais forces comparison with Cervantes, whose precursor
 he was in reality, though the two books and the two minds are very
 different. They have only one point in common, their attack and ridicule
 of the romances of chivalry and of the wildly improbable adventures of
 knight-errants. But in Don Quixote there is not a single detail which
 would suggest that Cervantes knew Rabelais' book or owed anything to it
 whatsoever, even the starting-point of his subject. Perhaps it was better
 he should not have been influenced by him, in however slight a degree; his
 originality is the more intact and the more genial.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the other hand, Rabelais has been several times translated into German.
 In the present century Regis published at Leipsic, from 1831 to 1841, with
 copious notes, a close and faithful translation. The first one cannot be
 so described, that of Johann Fischart, a native of Mainz or Strasburg, who
 died in 1614. He was a Protestant controversialist, and a satirist of
 fantastic and abundant imagination. In 1575 appeared his translation of
 Rabelais' first book, and in 1590 he published the comic catalogue of the
 library of Saint Victor, borrowed from the second book. It is not a
 translation, but a recast in the boldest style, full of alterations and of
 exaggerations, both as regards the coarse expressions which he took upon
 himself to develop and to add to, and in the attacks on the Roman Catholic
 Church. According to Jean Paul Richter, Fischart is much superior to
 Rabelais in style and in the fruitfulness of his ideas, and his equal in
 erudition and in the invention of new expressions after the manner of
 Aristophanes. He is sure that his work was successful, because it was
 often reprinted during his lifetime; but this enthusiasm of Jean Paul
 would hardly carry conviction in France. Who treads in another's
 footprints must follow in the rear. Instead of a creator, he is but an
 imitator. Those who take the ideas of others to modify them, and make of
 them creations of their own, like Shakespeare in England, Moliere and La
 Fontaine in France, may be superior to those who have served them with
 suggestions; but then the new works must be altogether different, must
 exist by themselves. Shakespeare and the others, when they imitated, may
 be said always to have destroyed their models. These copyists, if we call
 them so, created such works of genius that the only pity is they are so
 rare. This is not the case with Fischart, but it would be none the less
 curious were some one thoroughly familiar with German to translate
 Fischart for us, or at least, by long extracts from him, give an idea of
 the vagaries of German taste when it thought it could do better than
 Rabelais. It is dangerous to tamper with so great a work, and he who does
 so runs a great risk of burning his fingers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 England has been less daring, and her modesty and discretion have brought
 her success. But, before speaking of Urquhart's translation, it is but
 right to mention the English-French Dictionary of Randle Cotgrave, the
 first edition of which dates from 1611. It is in every way exceedingly
 valuable, and superior to that of Nicot, because instead of keeping to the
 plane of classic and Latin French, it showed an acquaintance with and
 mastery of the popular tongue as well as of the written and learned
 language. As a foreigner, Cotgrave is a little behind in his information.
 He is not aware of all the changes and novelties of the passing fashion.
 The Pleiad School he evidently knew nothing of, but kept to the writers of
 the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century. Thus words out
 of Rabelais, which he always translates with admirable skill, are
 frequent, and he attaches to them their author's name. So Rabelais had
 already crossed the Channel, and was read in his own tongue. Somewhat
 later, during the full sway of the Commonwealth?and Maitre
 Alcofribas Nasier must have been a surprising apparition in the midst of
 Puritan severity?Captain Urquhart undertook to translate him and to
 naturalize him completely in England.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thomas Urquhart belonged to a very old family of good standing in the
 North of Scotland. After studying in Aberdeen he travelled in France,
 Spain, and Italy, where his sword was as active as that intelligent
 curiosity of his which is evidenced by his familiarity with three
 languages and the large library which he brought back, according to his
 own account, from sixteen countries he had visited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On his return to England he entered the service of Charles I., who
 knighted him in 1641. Next year, after the death of his father, he went to
 Scotland to set his family affairs in order, and to redeem his house in
 Cromarty. But, in spite of another sojourn in foreign lands, his efforts
 to free himself from pecuniary embarrassments were unavailing. At the
 king's death his Scottish loyalty caused him to side with those who
 opposed the Parliament. Formally proscribed in 1649, taken prisoner at the
 defeat of Worcester in 1651, stripped of all his belongings, he was
 brought to London, but was released on parole at Cromwell's
 recommendation. After receiving permission to spend five months in
 Scotland to try once more to settle his affairs, he came back to London to
 escape from his creditors. And there he must have died, though the date of
 his death is unknown. It probably took place after 1653, the date of the
 publication of the two first books, and after having written the
 translation of the third, which was not printed from his manuscript till
 the end of the seventeenth century.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His life was therefore not without its troubles, and literary activity
 must have been almost his only consolation. His writings reveal him as the
 strangest character, fantastic, and full of a naive vanity, which, even at
 the time he was translating the genealogy of Gargantua?surely well
 calculated to cure any pondering on his own?caused him to trace his
 unbroken descent from Adam, and to state that his family name was derived
 from his ancestor Esormon, Prince of Achaia, 2139 B.C., who was surnamed
 Ourochartos, that is to say the Fortunate and the Well-beloved. A Gascon
 could not have surpassed this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gifted as he was, learned in many directions, an enthusiastic
 mathematician, master of several languages, occasionally full of wit and
 humour, and even good sense, yet he gave his books the strangest titles,
 and his ideas were no less whimsical. His style is mystic, fastidious, and
 too often of a wearisome length and obscurity; his verses rhyme anyhow, or
 not at all; but vivacity, force and heat are never lacking, and the
 Maitland Club did well in reprinting, in 1834, his various works, which
 are very rare. Yet, in spite of their curious interest, he owes his real
 distinction and the survival of his name to his translation of Rabelais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first two books appeared in 1653. The original edition, exceedingly
 scarce, was carefully reprinted in 1838, only a hundred copies being
 issued, by an English bibliophile T(heodore) M(artin), whose interesting
 preface I regret to sum up so cursorily. At the end of the seventeenth
 century, in 1693, a French refugee, Peter Antony Motteux, whose English
 verses and whose plays are not without value, published in a little octavo
 volume a reprint, very incorrect as to the text, of the first two books,
 to which he added the third, from the manuscript found amongst Urquhart's
 papers. The success which attended this venture suggested to Motteux the
 idea of completing the work, and a second edition, in two volumes,
 appeared in 1708, with the translation of the fourth and fifth books, and
 notes. Nineteen years after his death, John Ozell, translator on a large
 scale of French, Italian, and Spanish authors, revised Motteux's edition,
 which he published in five volumes in 1737, adding Le Duchat's notes; and
 this version has often been reprinted since.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The continuation by Motteux, who was also the translator of Don Quixote,
 has merits of its own. It is precise, elegant, and very faithful.
 Urquhart's, without taking liberties with Rabelais like Fischart, is not
 always so closely literal and exact. Nevertheless, it is much superior to
 Motteux's. If Urquhart does not constantly adhere to the form of the
 expression, if he makes a few slight additions, not only has he an
 understanding of the original, but he feels it, and renders the sense with
 a force and a vivacity full of warmth and brilliancy. His own learning
 made the comprehension of the work easy to him, and his anglicization of
 words fabricated by Rabelais is particularly successful. The necessity of
 keeping to his text prevented his indulgence in the convolutions and
 divagations dictated by his exuberant fancy when writing on his own
 account. His style, always full of life and vigour, is here balanced,
 lucid, and picturesque. Never elsewhere did he write so well. And thus the
 translation reproduces the very accent of the original, besides possessing
 a very remarkable character of its own. Such a literary tone and such
 literary qualities are rarely found in a translation. Urquhart's, very
 useful for the interpretation of obscure passages, may, and indeed should
 be read as a whole, both for Rabelais and for its own merits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holland, too, possesses a translation of Rabelais. They knew French in
 that country in the seventeenth century better than they do to-day, and
 there Rabelais' works were reprinted when no editions were appearing in
 France. This Dutch translation was published at Amsterdam in 1682, by J.
 Tenhoorn. The name attached to it, Claudio Gallitalo (Claudius
 French-Italian) must certainly be a pseudonym. Only a Dutch scholar could
 identify the translator, and state the value to be assigned to his work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rabelais' style has many different sources. Besides its force and
 brilliancy, its gaiety, wit, and dignity, its abundant richness is no less
 remarkable. It would be impossible and useless to compile a glossary of
 Voltaire's words. No French writer has used so few, and all of them are of
 the simplest. There is not one of them that is not part of the common
 speech, or which demands a note or an explanation. Rabelais' vocabulary,
 on the other hand, is of an astonishing variety. Where does it all come
 from? As a fact, he had at his command something like three languages,
 which he used in turn, or which he mixed according to the effect he wished
 to produce.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First of all, of course, he had ready to his hand the whole speech of his
 time, which had no secrets for him. Provincials have been too eager to
 appropriate him, to make of him a local author, the pride of some village,
 in order that their district might have the merit of being one of the
 causes, one of the factors of his genius. Every neighbourhood where he
 ever lived has declared that his distinction was due to his knowledge of
 its popular speech. But these dialect-patriots have fallen out among
 themselves. To which dialect was he indebted? Was it that of Touraine, or
 Berri, or Poitou, or Paris? It is too often forgotten, in regard to French
 patois?leaving out of count the languages of the South?that
 the words or expressions that are no longer in use to-day are but a
 survival, a still living trace of the tongue and the pronunciation of
 other days. Rabelais, more than any other writer, took advantage of the
 happy chances and the richness of the popular speech, but he wrote in
 French, and nothing but French. That is why he remains so forcible, so
 lucid, and so living, more living even?speaking only of his style
 out of charity to the others?than any of his contemporaries.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It has been said that great French prose is solely the work of the
 seventeenth century. There were nevertheless, before that, two men,
 certainly very different and even hostile, who were its initiators and its
 masters, Calvin on the one hand, on the other Rabelais.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rabelais had a wonderful knowledge of the prose and the verse of the
 fifteenth century: he was familiar with Villon, Pathelin, the Quinze Joies
 de Mariage, the Cent Nouvelles, the chronicles and the romances, and even
 earlier works, too, such as the Roman de la Rose. Their words, their turns
 of expression came naturally to his pen, and added a piquancy and, as it
 were, a kind of gloss of antique novelty to his work. He fabricated words,
 too, on Greek and Latin models, with great ease, sometimes audaciously and
 with needless frequency. These were for him so many means, so many
 elements of variety. Sometimes he did this in mockery, as in the humorous
 discourse of the Limousin scholar, for which he is not a little indebted
 to Geoffroy Tory in the Champfleury; sometimes, on the contrary,
 seriously, from a habit acquired in dealing with classical tongues.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again, another reason of the richness of his vocabulary was that he
 invented and forged words for himself. Following the example of
 Aristophanes, he coined an enormous number of interminable words, droll
 expressions, sudden and surprising constructions. What had made Greece and
 the Athenians laugh was worth transporting to Paris.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With an instrument so rich, resources so endless, and the skill to use
 them, it is no wonder that he could give voice to anything, be as humorous
 as he could be serious, as comic as he could be grave, that he could
 express himself and everybody else, from the lowest to the highest. He had
 every colour on his palette, and such skill was in his fingers that he
 could depict every variety of light and shade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 We have evidence that Rabelais did not always write in the same fashion.
 The Chronique Gargantuaine is uniform in style and quite simple, but
 cannot with certainty be attributed to him. His letters are bombastic and
 thin; his few attempts at verse are heavy, lumbering, and obscure,
 altogether lacking in harmony, and quite as bad as those of his friend,
 Jean Bouchet. He had no gift of poetic form, as indeed is evident even
 from his prose. And his letters from Rome to the Bishop of Maillezais,
 interesting as they are in regard to the matter, are as dull, bare, flat,
 and dry in style as possible. Without his signature no one would possibly
 have thought of attributing them to him. He is only a literary artist when
 he wishes to be such; and in his romance he changes the style completely
 every other moment: it has no constant character or uniform manner, and
 therefore unity is almost entirely wanting in his work, while his
 endeavours after contrast are unceasing. There is throughout the whole the
 evidence of careful and conscious elaboration.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hence, however lucid and free be the style of his romance, and though its
 flexibility and ease seem at first sight to have cost no trouble at all,
 yet its merit lies precisely in the fact that it succeeds in concealing
 the toil, in hiding the seams. He could not have reached this perfection
 at a first attempt. He must have worked long at the task, revised it again
 and again, corrected much, and added rather than cut away. The aptness of
 form and expression has been arrived at by deliberate means, and owes
 nothing to chance. Apart from the toning down of certain bold passages, to
 soften their effect, and appease the storm?for these were not
 literary alterations, but were imposed on him by prudence?one can
 see how numerous are the variations in his text, how necessary it is to
 take account of them, and to collect them. A good edition, of course,
 would make no attempt at amalgamating these. That would give a false
 impression and end in confusion; but it should note them all, and show
 them all, not combined, but simply as variations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After Le Duchat, all the editions, in their care that nothing should be
 lost, made the mistake of collecting and placing side by side things which
 had no connection with each other, which had even been substituted for
 each other. The result was a fabricated text, full of contradictions
 naturally. But since the edition issued by M. Jannet, the well-known
 publisher of the Bibliotheque Elzevirienne, who was the first to get rid
 of this patchwork, this mosaic, Rabelais' latest text has been given,
 accompanied by all the earlier variations, to show the changes he made, as
 well as his suppressions and additions. It would also be possible to
 reverse the method. It would be interesting to take his first text as the
 basis, noting the later modifications. This would be quite as instructive
 and really worth doing. Perhaps one might then see more clearly with what
 care he made his revisions, after what fashion he corrected, and
 especially what were the additions he made.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No more striking instance can be quoted than the admirable chapter about
 the shipwreck. It was not always so long as Rabelais made it in the end:
 it was much shorter at first. As a rule, when an author recasts some
 passage that he wishes to revise, he does so by rewriting the whole, or at
 least by interpolating passages at one stroke, so to speak. Nothing of the
 kind is seen here. Rabelais suppressed nothing, modified nothing; he did
 not change his plan at all. What he did was to make insertions, to slip in
 between two clauses a new one. He expressed his meaning in a lengthier
 way, and the former clause is found in its integrity along with the
 additional one, of which it forms, as it were, the warp. It was by this
 method of touching up the smallest details, by making here and there such
 little noticeable additions, that he succeeded in heightening the effect
 without either change or loss. In the end it looks as if he had altered
 nothing, added nothing new, as if it had always been so from the first,
 and had never been meddled with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The comparison is most instructive, showing us to what an extent Rabelais'
 admirable style was due to conscious effort, care, and elaboration, a fact
 which is generally too much overlooked, and how instead of leaving any
 trace which would reveal toil and study, it has on the contrary a
 marvellous cohesion, precision, and brilliancy. It was modelled and
 remodelled, repaired, touched up, and yet it has all the appearance of
 having been created at a single stroke, or of having been run like molten
 wax into its final form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something should be said here of the sources from which Rabelais borrowed.
 He was not the first in France to satirize the romances of chivalry. The
 romance in verse by Baudouin de Sebourc, printed in recent years, was a
 parody of the Chansons de Geste. In the Moniage Guillaume, and especially
 in the Moniage Rainouart, in which there is a kind of giant, and
 occasionally a comic giant, there are situations and scenes which remind
 us of Rabelais. The kind of Fabliaux in mono-rhyme quatrains of the old
 Aubery anticipate his coarse and popular jests. But all that is beside the
 question; Rabelais did not know these. Nothing is of direct interest save
 what was known to him, what fell under his eyes, what lay to his hand?as
 the Facetiae of Poggio, and the last sermonnaires. In the course of one's
 reading one may often enough come across the origin of some of Rabelais'
 witticisms; here and there we may discover how he has developed a
 situation. While gathering his materials wherever he could find them, he
 was nevertheless profoundly original.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On this point much research and investigation might be employed. But there
 is no need why these researches should be extended to the region of fancy.
 Gargantua has been proved by some to be of Celtic origin. Very often he is
 a solar myth, and the statement that Rabelais only collected popular
 traditions and gave new life to ancient legends is said to be proved by
 the large number of megalithic monuments to which is attached the name of
 Gargantua. It was, of course, quite right to make a list of these, to draw
 up, as it were, a chart of them, but the conclusion is not justified. The
 name, instead of being earlier, is really later, and is a witness, not to
 the origin, but to the success and rapid popularity of his novel. No one
 has ever yet produced a written passage or any ancient testimony to prove
 the existence of the name before Rabelais. To place such a tradition on a
 sure basis, positive traces must be forthcoming; and they cannot be
 adduced even for the most celebrated of these monuments, since he mentions
 himself the great menhir near Poitiers, which he christened by the name of
 Passelourdin. That there is something in the theory is possible. Perrault
 found the subjects of his stories in the tales told by mothers and nurses.
 He fixed them finally by writing them down. Floating about vaguely as they
 were, he seized them, worked them up, gave them shape, and yet of scarcely
 any of them is there to be found before his time a single trace. So we
 must resign ourselves to know just as little of what Gargantua and
 Pantagruel were before the sixteenth century.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a book of a contemporary of Rabelais, the Legende de Pierre Faifeu by
 the Angevin, Charles de Bourdigne, the first edition of which dates from
 1526 and the second 1531?both so rare and so forgotten that the work
 is only known since the eighteenth century by the reprint of Custelier?in
 the introductory ballad which recommends this book to readers, occur these
 lines in the list of popular books which Faifeu would desire to replace:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> 'Laissez ester Caillette le folastre,
 Les quatre filz Aymon vestuz de bleu,
 Gargantua qui a cheveux de plastre.'
</pre>
 <p>
 He has not 'cheveux de plastre' in Rabelais. If the rhyme had not
 suggested the phrase?and the exigencies of the strict form of the
 ballade and its forced repetitions often imposed an idea which had its
 whole origin in the rhyme?we might here see a dramatic trace found
 nowhere else. The name of Pantagruel is mentioned too, incidentally, in a
 Mystery of the fifteenth century. These are the only references to the
 names which up till now have been discovered, and they are, as one sees,
 of but little account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the other hand, the influence of Aristophanes and of Lucian, his
 intimate acquaintance with nearly all the writers of antiquity, Greek as
 well as Latin, with whom Rabelais is more permeated even than Montaigne,
 were a mine of inspiration. The proof of it is everywhere. Pliny
 especially was his encyclopaedia, his constant companion. All he says of
 the Pantagruelian herb, though he amply developed it for himself, is taken
 from Pliny's chapter on flax. And there is a great deal more of this kind
 to be discovered, for Rabelais does not always give it as quotation. On
 the other hand, when he writes, 'Such an one says,' it would be difficult
 enough to find who is meant, for the 'such an one' is a fictitious writer.
 The method is amusing, but it is curious to account of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The question of the Chronique Gargantuaine is still undecided. Is it by
 Rabelais or by someone else? Both theories are defensible, and can be
 supported by good reasons. In the Chronique everything is heavy,
 occasionally meaningless, and nearly always insipid. Can the same man have
 written the Chronique and Gargantua, replaced a book really commonplace by
 a masterpiece, changed the facts and incidents, transformed a heavy icy
 pleasantry into a work glowing with wit and life, made it no longer a mass
 of laborious trifling and cold-blooded exaggerations but a satire on human
 life of the highest genius? Still there are points common to the two.
 Besides, Rabelais wrote other things; and it is only in his romance that
 he shows literary skill. The conception of it would have entered his mind
 first only in a bare and summary fashion. It would have been taken up
 again, expanded, developed, metamorphosed. That is possible, and, for my
 part, I am of those who, like Brunet and Nodier, are inclined to think
 that the Chronique, in spite of its inferiority, is really a first
 attempt, condemned as soon as the idea was conceived in another form. As
 its earlier date is incontestable, we must conclude that if the Chronique
 is not by him, his Gargantua and its continuation would not have existed
 without it. This would be a great obligation to stand under to some
 unknown author, and in that case it is astonishing that his enemies did
 not reproach him during his lifetime with being merely an imitator and a
 plagiarist. So there are reasons for and against his authorship of it, and
 it would be dangerous to make too bold an assertion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One fact which is absolutely certain and beyond all controversy, is that
 Rabelais owed much to one of his contemporaries, an Italian, to the
 Histoire Macaronique of Merlin Coccaie. Its author, Theophilus Folengo,
 who was also a monk, was born in 1491, and died only a short time before
 Rabelais, in 1544. But his burlesque poem was published in 1517. It was in
 Latin verse, written in an elaborately fabricated style. It is not dog
 Latin, but Latin ingeniously italianized, or rather Italian, even Mantuan,
 latinized. The contrast between the modern form of the word and its Roman
 garb produces the most amusing effect. In the original it is sometimes
 difficult to read, for Folengo has no objection to using the most
 colloquial words and phrases.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The subject is quite different. It is the adventures of Baldo, son of Guy
 de Montauban, the very lively history of his youth, his trial,
 imprisonment and deliverance, his journey in search of his father, during
 which he visits the Planets and Hell. The narration is constantly
 interrupted by incidental adventures. Occasionally they are what would be
 called to-day very naturalistic, and sometimes they are madly extravagant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Fracasso, Baldo's friend, is a giant; another friend, Cingar, who
 delivers him, is Panurge exactly, and quite as much given to practical
 joking. The women in the senile amour of the old Tognazzo, the judges, and
 the poor sergeants, are no more gently dealt with by Folengo than by the
 monk of the Iles d'Hyeres. If Dindenaut's name does not occur, there are
 the sheep. The tempest is there, and the invocation to all the saints.
 Rabelais improves all he borrows, but it is from Folengo he starts. He
 does not reproduce the words, but, like the Italian, he revels in drinking
 scenes, junkettings, gormandizing, battles, scuffles, wounds and corpses,
 magic, witches, speeches, repeated enumerations, lengthiness, and a
 solemnly minute precision of impossible dates and numbers. The atmosphere,
 the tone, the methods are the same, and to know Rabelais well, you must
 know Folengo well too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Detailed proof of this would be too lengthy a matter; one would have to
 quote too many passages, but on this question of sources nothing is more
 interesting than a perusal of the Opus Macaronicorum. It was translated
 into French only in 1606?Paris, Gilley Robinot. This translation of
 course cannot reproduce all the many amusing forms of words, but it is
 useful, nevertheless, in showing more clearly the points of resemblance
 between the two works,?how far in form, ideas, details, and phrases
 Rabelais was permeated by Folengo. The anonymous translator saw this quite
 well, and said so in his title, 'Histoire macaronique de Merlin Coccaie,
 prototype of Rabelais.' It is nothing but the truth, and Rabelais, who
 does not hide it from himself, on more than one occasion mentions the name
 of Merlin Coccaie.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Besides, Rabelais was fed on the Italians of his time as on the Greeks and
 Romans. Panurge, who owes much to Cingar, is also not free from
 obligations to the miscreant Margutte in the Morgante Maggiore of Pulci.
 Had Rabelais in his mind the tale from the Florentine Chronicles, how in
 the Savonarola riots, when the Piagnoni and the Arrabiati came to blows in
 the church of the Dominican convent of San-Marco, Fra Pietro in the
 scuffle broke the heads of the assailants with the bronze crucifix he had
 taken from the altar? A well-handled cross could so readily be used as a
 weapon, that probably it has served as such more than once, and other and
 even quite modern instances might be quoted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But other Italian sources are absolutely certain. There are few more
 wonderful chapters in Rabelais than the one about the drinkers. It is not
 a dialogue: those short exclamations exploding from every side, all
 referring to the same thing, never repeating themselves, and yet always
 varying the same theme. At the end of the Novelle of Gentile Sermini of
 Siena, there is a chapter called Il Giuoco della pugna, the Game of
 Battle. Here are the first lines of it: 'Apre, apre, apre. Chi gioca, chi
 gioca ?uh, uh!?A Porrione, a Porrione.?Viela, viela;
 date a ognuno.?Alle mantella, alle mantella.?Oltre di corsa;
 non vi fermate.?Voltate qui; ecco costoro; fate veli innanzi.?Viela,
 viela; date costi.?Chi la fa? Io?Ed io.?Dagli; ah, ah,
 buona fu.?Or cosi; alla mascella, al fianco. ?Dagli basso; di
 punta, di punta.?Ah, ah, buon gioco, buon gioco.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And thus it goes on with fire and animation for pages. Rabelais probably
 translated or directly imitated it. He changed the scene; there was no
 giuooco della pugna in France. He transferred to a drinking-bout this
 clatter of exclamations which go off by themselves, which cross each other
 and get no answer. He made a wonderful thing of it. But though he did not
 copy Sermini, yet Sermini's work provided him with the form of the
 subject, and was the theme for Rabelais' marvellous variations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Who does not remember the fantastic quarrel of the cook with the poor
 devil who had flavoured his dry bread with the smoke of the roast, and the
 judgment of Seyny John, truly worthy of Solomon? It comes from the Cento
 Novelle Antiche, rewritten from tales older than Boccaccio, and moreover
 of an extreme brevity and dryness. They are only the framework, the notes,
 the skeleton of tales. The subject is often wonderful, but nothing is made
 of it: it is left unshaped. Rabelais wrote a version of one, the ninth.
 The scene takes place, not at Paris, but at Alexandria in Egypt among the
 Saracens, and the cook is called Fabrac. But the surprise at the end, the
 sagacious judgment by which the sound of a piece of money was made the
 price of the smoke, is the same. Now the first dated edition of the Cento
 Novelle (which were frequently reprinted) appeared at Bologna in 1525, and
 it is certain that Rabelais had read the tales. And there would be much
 else of the same kind to learn if we knew Rabelais' library.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A still stranger fact of this sort may be given to show how nothing came
 amiss to him. He must have known, and even copied the Latin Chronicle of
 the Counts of Anjou. It is accepted, and rightly so, as an historical
 document, but that is no reason for thinking that the truth may not have
 been manipulated and adorned. The Counts of Anjou were not saints. They
 were proud, quarrelsome, violent, rapacious, and extravagant, as greedy as
 they were charitable to the Church, treacherous and cruel. Yet their
 anonymous panegyrist has made them patterns of all the virtues. In reality
 it is both a history and in some sort a romance; especially is it a
 collection of examples worthy of being followed, in the style of the
 Cyropaedia, our Juvenal of the fifteenth century, and a little like
 Fenelon's Telemaque. Now in it there occurs the address of one of the
 counts to those who rebelled against him and who were at his mercy.
 Rabelais must have known it, for he has copied it, or rather, literally
 translated whole lines of it in the wonderful speech of Gargantua to the
 vanquished. His contemporaries, who approved of his borrowing from
 antiquity, could not detect this one, because the book was not printed
 till much later. But Rabelais lived in Maine. In Anjou, which often
 figures among the localities he names, he must have met with and read the
 Chronicles of the Counts in manuscript, probably in some monastery
 library, whether at Fontenay-le-Comte or elsewhere it matters little.
 There is not only a likeness in the ideas and tone, but in the words too,
 which cannot be a mere matter of chance. He must have known the Chronicles
 of the Counts of Anjou, and they inspired one of his finest pages. One
 sees, therefore, how varied were the sources whence he drew, and how many
 of them must probably always escape us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When, as has been done for Moliere, a critical bibliography of the works
 relating to Rabelais is drawn up?which, by the bye, will entail a
 very great amount of labour?the easiest part will certainly be the
 bibliography of the old editions. That is the section that has been most
 satisfactorily and most completely worked out. M. Brunet said the last
 word on the subject in his Researches in 1852, and in the important
 article in the fifth edition of his Manuel du Libraire (iv., 1863, pp.
 1037-1071).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The facts about the fifth book cannot be summed up briefly. It was printed
 as a whole at first, without the name of the place, in 1564, and next year
 at Lyons by Jean Martin. It has given, and even still gives rise to two
 contradictory opinions. Is it Rabelais' or not?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 First of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen years have gone by
 before it was printed? Then, does it bear evident marks of his
 workmanship? Is the hand of the master visible throughout? Antoine Du
 Verdier in the 1605 edition of his Prosopographie writes: '(Rabelais')
 misfortune has been that everybody has wished to "pantagruelize!" and
 several books have appeared under his name, and have been added to his
 works, which are not by him, as, for instance, l'Ile Sonnante, written by
 a certain scholar of Valence and others.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The scholar of Valence might be Guillaume des Autels, to whom with more
 certainty can be ascribed the authorship of a dull imitation of Rabelais,
 the History of Fanfreluche and Gaudichon, published in 1578, which, to say
 the least of it, is very much inferior to the fifth book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Louis Guyon, in his Diverses Lecons, is still more positive: 'As to the
 last book which has been included in his works, entitled l'Ile Sonnante,
 the object of which seems to be to find fault with and laugh at the
 members and the authorities of the Catholic Church, I protest that he did
 not compose it, for it was written long after his death. I was at Paris
 when it was written, and I know quite well who was its author; he was not
 a doctor.' That is very emphatic, and it is impossible to ignore it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet everyone must recognize that there is a great deal of Rabelais in the
 fifth book. He must have planned it and begun it. Remembering that in 1548
 he had published, not as an experiment, but rather as a bait and as an
 announcement, the first eleven chapters of the fourth book, we may
 conclude that the first sixteen chapters of the fifth book published by
 themselves nine years after his death, in 1562, represent the remainder of
 his definitely finished work. This is the more certain because these first
 chapters, which contain the Apologue of the Horse and the Ass and the
 terrible Furred Law-cats, are markedly better than what follows them. They
 are not the only ones where the master's hand may be traced, but they are
 the only ones where no other hand could possibly have interfered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the remainder the sentiment is distinctly Protestant. Rabelais was much
 struck by the vices of the clergy and did not spare them. Whether we are
 unable to forgive his criticisms because they were conceived in a spirit
 of raillery, or whether, on the other hand, we feel admiration for him on
 this point, yet Rabelais was not in the least a sectary. If he strongly
 desired a moral reform, indirectly pointing out the need of it in his
 mocking fashion, he was not favourable to a political reform. Those who
 would make of him a Protestant altogether forget that the Protestants of
 his time were not for him, but against him. Henri Estienne, for instance,
 Ramus, Theodore de Beze, and especially Calvin, should know how he was to
 be regarded. Rabelais belonged to what may be called the early
 reformation, to that band of honest men in the beginning of the sixteenth
 century, precursors of the later one perhaps, but, like Erasmus, between
 the two extremes. He was neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, neither German
 nor Genevese, and it is quite natural that his work was not reprinted in
 Switzerland, which would certainly have happened had the Protestants
 looked on him as one of themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That Rabelais collected the materials for the fifth book, had begun it,
 and got on some way, there can be no doubt: the excellence of a large
 number of passages prove it, but?taken as a whole?the fifth
 book has not the value, the verve, and the variety of the others. The
 style is quite different, less rich, briefer, less elaborate, drier, in
 parts even wearisome. In the first four books Rabelais seldom repeats
 himself. The fifth book contains from the point of view of the vocabulary
 really the least novelty. On the contrary, it is full of words and
 expressions already met with, which is very natural in an imitation, in a
 copy, forced to keep to a similar tone, and to show by such reminders and
 likenesses that it is really by the same pen. A very striking point is the
 profound difference in the use of anatomical terms. In the other books
 they are most frequently used in a humorous sense, and nonsensically, with
 a quite other meaning than their own; in the fifth they are applied
 correctly. It was necessary to include such terms to keep up the practice,
 but the writer has not thought of using them to add to the comic effect:
 one cannot always think of everything. Trouble has been taken, of course,
 to include enumerations, but there are much fewer fabricated and fantastic
 words. In short, the hand of the maker is far from showing the same
 suppleness and strength.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A eulogistic quatrain is signed Nature quite, which, it is generally
 agreed, is an anagram of Jean Turquet. Did the adapter of the fifth book
 sign his work in this indirect fashion? He might be of the Genevese family
 to whom Louis Turquet and his son Theodore belonged, both well-known, and
 both strong Protestants. The obscurity relating to this matter is far from
 being cleared up, and perhaps never will be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It fell to my lot?here, unfortunately, I am forced to speak of a
 personal matter?to print for the first time the manuscript of the
 fifth book. At first it was hoped it might be in Rabelais' own hand;
 afterwards that it might be at least a copy of his unfinished work. The
 task was a difficult one, for the writing, extremely flowing and rapid, is
 execrable, and most difficult to decipher and to transcribe accurately.
 Besides, it often happens in the sixteenth and the end of the fifteenth
 century, that manuscripts are much less correct than the printed versions,
 even when they have not been copied by clumsy and ignorant hands. In this
 case, it is the writing of a clerk executed as quickly as possible. The
 farther it goes the more incorrect it becomes, as if the writer were in
 haste to finish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What is really the origin of it? It has less the appearance of notes or
 fragments prepared by Rabelais than of a first attempt at revision. It is
 not an author's rough draft; still less is it his manuscript. If I had not
 printed this enigmatical text with scrupulous and painful fidelity, I
 would do it now. It was necessary to do it so as to clear the way. But as
 the thing is done, and accessible to those who may be interested, and who
 wish to critically examine it, there is no further need of reprinting it.
 All the editions of Rabelais continue, and rightly, to reproduce the
 edition of 1564. It is not the real Rabelais, but however open to
 criticism it may be, it was under that form that the fifth book appeared
 in the sixteenth century, under that form it was accepted. Consequently it
 is convenient and even necessary to follow and keep to the original
 edition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first sixteen chapters may, and really must be, the text of Rabelais,
 in the final form as left by him, and found after his death; the
 framework, and a number of the passages in the continuation, the best
 ones, of course, are his, but have been patched up and tampered with.
 Nothing can have been suppressed of what existed; it was evidently thought
 that everything should be admitted with the final revision; but the tone
 was changed, additions were made, and 'improvements.' Adapters are always
 strangely vain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the seventeenth century, the French printing-press, save for an edition
 issued at Troyes in 1613, gave up publishing Rabelais, and the work passed
 to foreign countries. Jean Fuet reprinted him at Antwerp in 1602. After
 the Amsterdam edition of 1659, where for the first time appears 'The
 Alphabet of the French Author,' comes the Elzevire edition of 1663. The
 type, an imitation of what made the reputation of the little volumes of
 the Gryphes of Lyons, is charming, the printing is perfect, and the paper,
 which is French?the development of paper-making in Holland and
 England did not take place till after the Revocation of the Edict of
 Nantes?is excellent. They are pretty volumes to the eye, but, as in
 all the reprints of the seventeenth century, the text is full of faults
 and most untrustworthy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 France, through a representative in a foreign land, however, comes into
 line again in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and in a really
 serious fashion, thanks to the very considerable learning of a French
 refugee, Jacob Le Duchat, who died in 1748. He had a most thorough
 knowledge of the French prose-writers of the sixteenth century, and he
 made them accessible by his editions of the Quinze Joies du Mariage, of
 Henri Estienne, of Agrippa d'Aubigne, of L'Etoile, and of the Satyre
 Menippee. In 1711 he published an edition of Rabelais at Amsterdam,
 through Henry Bordesius, in five duodecimo volumes. The reprint in quarto
 which he issued in 1741, seven years before his death, is, with its
 engravings by Bernard Picot, a fine library edition. Le Duchat's is the
 first of the critical editions. It takes account of differences in the
 texts, and begins to point out the variations. His very numerous notes are
 remarkable, and are still worthy of most serious consideration. He was the
 first to offer useful elucidations, and these have been repeated after
 him, and with good reason will continue to be so. The Abbe de Massy's
 edition of 1752, also an Amsterdam production, has made use of Le Duchat's
 but does not take its place. Finally, at the end of the century, Cazin
 printed Rabelais in his little volume, in 1782, and Bartiers issued two
 editions (of no importance) at Paris in 1782 and 1798. Fortunately the
 nineteenth century has occupied itself with the great 'Satyrique' in a
 more competent and useful fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In 1820 L'Aulnaye published through Desoer his three little volumes,
 printed in exquisite style, and which have other merits besides. His
 volume of annotations, in which, that nothing might be lost of his own
 notes, he has included many things not directly relating to Rabelais, is
 full of observations and curious remarks which are very useful additions
 to Le Duchat. One fault to be found with him is his further complication
 of the spelling. This he did in accordance with a principle that the words
 should be referred to their real etymology. Learned though he was,
 Rabelais had little care to be so etymological, and it is not his theories
 but those of the modern scholar that have been ventilated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Somewhat later, from 1823 to 1826, Esmangart and Johanneau issued a
 variorum edition in nine volumes, in which the text is often encumbered by
 notes which are really too numerous, and, above all, too long. The work
 was an enormous one, but the best part of it is Le Duchat's, and what is
 not his is too often absolutely hypothetical and beside the truth. Le
 Duchat had already given too much importance to the false historical
 explanation. Here it is constantly coming in, and it rests on no evidence.
 In reality, there is no need of the key to Rabelais by which to discover
 the meaning of subtle allusions. He is neither so complicated nor so full
 of riddles. We know how he has scattered the names of contemporaries about
 his work, sometimes of friends, sometimes of enemies, and without
 disguising them under any mask. He is no more Panurge than Louis XII. is
 Gargantua or Francis I. Pantagruel. Rabelais says what he wants, all he
 wants, and in the way he wants. There are no mysteries below the surface,
 and it is a waste of time to look for knots in a bulrush. All the
 historical explanations are purely imaginary, utterly without proof, and
 should the more emphatically be looked on as baseless and dismissed. They
 are radically false, and therefore both worthless and harmful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In 1840 there appeared in the Bibliotheque Charpentier the Rabelais in a
 single duodecimo volume, begun by Charles Labiche, and, after his death,
 completed by M. Paul Lacroix, whose share is the larger. The text is that
 of L'Aulnaye; the short footnotes, with all their brevity, contain useful
 explanations of difficult words. Amongst the editions of Rabelais this is
 one of the most important, because it brought him many readers and
 admirers. No other has made him so well and so widely known as this
 portable volume, which has been constantly reprinted. No other has been so
 widely circulated, and the sale still goes on. It was, and must still be
 looked on as a most serviceable edition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The edition published by Didot in 1857 has an altogether special
 character. In the biographical notice M. Rathery for the first time
 treated as they deserve the foolish prejudices which have made Rabelais
 misunderstood, and M. Burgaud des Marets set the text on a quite new base.
 Having proved, what of course is very evident, that in the original
 editions the spelling, and the language too, were of the simplest and
 clearest, and were not bristling with the nonsensical and superfluous
 consonants which have given rise to the idea that Rabelais is difficult to
 read, he took the trouble first of all to note the spelling of each word.
 Whenever in a single instance he found it in accordance with modern
 spelling, he made it the same throughout. The task was a hard one, and
 Rabelais certainly gained in clearness, but over-zeal is often fatal to a
 reform. In respect to its precision and the value of its notes, which are
 short and very judicious, Burgaud des Marets' edition is valuable, and is
 amongst those which should be known and taken into account.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Since Le Duchat all the editions have a common fault. They are not exactly
 guilty of fabricating, but they set up an artificial text in the sense
 that, in order to lose as little as possible, they have collected and
 united what originally were variations?the revisions, in short, of
 the original editions. Guided by the wise counsels given by Brunet in 1852
 in his Researches on the old editions of Rabelais, Pierre Jannet published
 the first three books in 1858; then, when the publication of the
 Bibliotheque Elzevirienne was discontinued, he took up the work again and
 finished the edition in Picard's blue library, in little volumes, each
 book quite distinct. It was M. Jannet who in our days first restored the
 pure and exact text of Rabelais, not only without retouching it, but
 without making additions or insertions, or juxtaposition of things that
 were not formerly found together. For each of the books he has followed
 the last edition issued by Rabelais, and all the earlier differences he
 gives as variations. It is astonishing that a thing so simple and so
 fitting should not have been done before, and the result is that this
 absolutely exact fidelity has restored a lucidity which was not wanting in
 Rabelais's time, but which had since been obscured. All who have come
 after Jannet have followed in his path, and there is no reason for
 straying from it.

 FRANCIS RABELAIS.
 </h2>
 <p>
 THE FIRST BOOK.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the Honoured, Noble Translator of Rabelais.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">Rabelais, whose wit prodigiously was made,
All men, professions, actions to invade,
With so much furious vigour, as if it
Had lived o'er each of them, and each had quit,
Yet with such happy sleight and careless skill,
As, like the serpent, doth with laughter kill,
So that although his noble leaves appear
Antic and Gottish, and dull souls forbear
To turn them o'er, lest they should only find
Nothing but savage monsters of a mind,?
No shapen beauteous thoughts; yet when the wise
Seriously strip him of his wild disguise,
Melt down his dross, refine his massy ore,
And polish that which seem'd rough-cast before,
Search his deep sense, unveil his hidden mirth,
And make that fiery which before seem'd earth
(Conquering those things of highest consequence,
What's difficult of language or of sense),
He will appear some noble table writ
In the old Egyptian hieroglyphic wit;
Where, though you monsters and grotescoes see,
You meet all mysteries of philosophy.
For he was wise and sovereignly bred
To know what mankind is, how 't may be led:
He stoop'd unto them, like that wise man, who
Rid on a stick, when 's children would do so.
For we are easy sullen things, and must
Be laugh'd aright, and cheated into trust;
Whilst a black piece of phlegm, that lays about
Dull menaces, and terrifies the rout,
And cajoles it, with all its peevish strength
Piteously stretch'd and botch'd up into length,
Whilst the tired rabble sleepily obey
Such opiate talk, and snore away the day,
By all his noise as much their minds relieves,
As caterwauling of wild cats frights thieves.
 But Rabelais was another thing, a man
Made up of all that art and nature can
Form from a fiery genius,?he was one
Whose soul so universally was thrown
Through all the arts of life, who understood
Each stratagem by which we stray from good;
So that he best might solid virtue teach,
As some 'gainst sins of their own bosoms preach:
He from wise choice did the true means prefer,
In the fool's coat acting th' philosopher.
 Thus hoary Aesop's beasts did mildly tame
Fierce man, and moralize him into shame;
Thus brave romances, while they seem to lay
Great trains of lust, platonic love display;
Thus would old Sparta, if a seldom chance
Show'd a drunk slave, teach children temperance;
Thus did the later poets nobly bring
The scene to height, making the fool the king.
 And, noble sir, you vigorously have trod
In this hard path, unknown, un-understood
By its own countrymen, 'tis you appear
Our full enjoyment which was our despair,
Scattering his mists, cheering his cynic frowns
(For radiant brightness now dark Rabelais crowns),
Leaving your brave heroic cares, which must
Make better mankind and embalm your dust,
So undeceiving us, that now we see
All wit in Gascon and in Cromarty,
Besides that Rabelais is convey'd to us,
And that our Scotland is not barbarous.

 The Author's Prologue to the First Book.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Most noble and illustrious drinkers, and you thrice precious pockified
 blades (for to you, and none else, do I dedicate my writings), Alcibiades,
 in that dialogue of Plato's, which is entitled The Banquet, whilst he was
 setting forth the praises of his schoolmaster Socrates (without all
 question the prince of philosophers), amongst other discourses to that
 purpose, said that he resembled the Silenes. Silenes of old were little
 boxes, like those we now may see in the shops of apothecaries, painted on
 the outside with wanton toyish figures, as harpies, satyrs, bridled geese,
 horned hares, saddled ducks, flying goats, thiller harts, and other
 such-like counterfeited pictures at discretion, to excite people unto
 laughter, as Silenus himself, who was the foster-father of good Bacchus,
 was wont to do; but within those capricious caskets were carefully
 preserved and kept many rich jewels and fine drugs, such as balm,
 ambergris, amomon, musk, civet, with several kinds of precious stones, and
 other things of great price. Just such another thing was Socrates. For to
 have eyed his outside, and esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you
 would not have given the peel of an onion for him, so deformed he was in
 body, and ridiculous in his gesture. He had a sharp pointed nose, with the
 look of a bull, and countenance of a fool: he was in his carriage simple,
 boorish in his apparel, in fortune poor, unhappy in his wives, unfit for
 all offices in the commonwealth, always laughing, tippling, and merrily
 carousing to everyone, with continual gibes and jeers, the better by those
 means to conceal his divine knowledge. Now, opening this box you would
 have found within it a heavenly and inestimable drug, a more than human
 understanding, an admirable virtue, matchless learning, invincible
 courage, unimitable sobriety, certain contentment of mind, perfect
 assurance, and an incredible misregard of all that for which men commonly
 do so much watch, run, sail, fight, travel, toil and turmoil themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flourish of a preamble tend?
 For so much as you, my good disciples, and some other jolly fools of ease
 and leisure, reading the pleasant titles of some books of our invention,
 as Gargantua, Pantagruel, Whippot (Fessepinte.), the Dignity of Codpieces,
 of Pease and Bacon with a Commentary, &amp;c., are too ready to judge that
 there is nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious discourse, and
 recreative lies; because the outside (which is the title) is usually,
 without any farther inquiry, entertained with scoffing and derision. But
 truly it is very unbeseeming to make so slight account of the works of
 men, seeing yourselves avouch that it is not the habit makes the monk,
 many being monasterially accoutred, who inwardly are nothing less than
 monachal, and that there are of those that wear Spanish capes, who have
 but little of the valour of Spaniards in them. Therefore is it, that you
 must open the book, and seriously consider of the matter treated in it.
 Then shall you find that it containeth things of far higher value than the
 box did promise; that is to say, that the subject thereof is not so
 foolish as by the title at the first sight it would appear to be.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And put the case, that in the literal sense you meet with purposes merry
 and solacious enough, and consequently very correspondent to their
 inscriptions, yet must not you stop there as at the melody of the charming
 syrens, but endeavour to interpret that in a sublimer sense which possibly
 you intended to have spoken in the jollity of your heart. Did you ever
 pick the lock of a cupboard to steal a bottle of wine out of it? Tell me
 truly, and, if you did, call to mind the countenance which then you had.
 Or, did you ever see a dog with a marrowbone in his mouth,?the beast
 of all other, says Plato, lib. 2, de Republica, the most philosophical? If
 you have seen him, you might have remarked with what devotion and
 circumspectness he wards and watcheth it: with what care he keeps it: how
 fervently he holds it: how prudently he gobbets it: with what affection he
 breaks it: and with what diligence he sucks it. To what end all this? What
 moveth him to take all these pains? What are the hopes of his labour? What
 doth he expect to reap thereby? Nothing but a little marrow. True it is,
 that this little is more savoury and delicious than the great quantities
 of other sorts of meat, because the marrow (as Galen testifieth, 5.
 facult. nat. &amp; 11. de usu partium) is a nourishment most perfectly
 elaboured by nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In imitation of this dog, it becomes you to be wise, to smell, feel and
 have in estimation these fair goodly books, stuffed with high conceptions,
 which, though seemingly easy in the pursuit, are in the cope and encounter
 somewhat difficult. And then, like him, you must, by a sedulous lecture,
 and frequent meditation, break the bone, and suck out the marrow,?that
 is, my allegorical sense, or the things I to myself propose to be
 signified by these Pythagorical symbols, with assured hope, that in so
 doing you will at last attain to be both well-advised and valiant by the
 reading of them: for in the perusal of this treatise you shall find
 another kind of taste, and a doctrine of a more profound and abstruse
 consideration, which will disclose unto you the most glorious sacraments
 and dreadful mysteries, as well in what concerneth your religion, as
 matters of the public state, and life economical.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Do you believe, upon your conscience, that Homer, whilst he was a-couching
 his Iliads and Odysses, had any thought upon those allegories, which
 Plutarch, Heraclides Ponticus, Eustathius, Cornutus squeezed out of him,
 and which Politian filched again from them? If you trust it, with neither
 hand nor foot do you come near to my opinion, which judgeth them to have
 been as little dreamed of by Homer, as the Gospel sacraments were by Ovid
 in his Metamorphoses, though a certain gulligut friar (Frere Lubin
 croquelardon.) and true bacon-picker would have undertaken to prove it, if
 perhaps he had met with as very fools as himself, (and as the proverb
 says) a lid worthy of such a kettle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If you give no credit thereto, why do not you the same in these jovial new
 chronicles of mine? Albeit when I did dictate them, I thought upon no more
 than you, who possibly were drinking the whilst as I was. For in the
 composing of this lordly book, I never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any
 other time than what was appointed to serve me for taking of my bodily
 refection, that is, whilst I was eating and drinking. And indeed that is
 the fittest and most proper hour wherein to write these high matters and
 deep sciences: as Homer knew very well, the paragon of all philologues,
 and Ennius, the father of the Latin poets, as Horace calls him, although a
 certain sneaking jobernol alleged that his verses smelled more of the wine
 than oil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So saith a turlupin or a new start-up grub of my books, but a turd for
 him. The fragrant odour of the wine, O how much more dainty, pleasant,
 laughing (Riant, priant, friant.), celestial and delicious it is, than
 that smell of oil! And I will glory as much when it is said of me, that I
 have spent more on wine than oil, as did Demosthenes, when it was told
 him, that his expense on oil was greater than on wine. I truly hold it for
 an honour and praise to be called and reputed a Frolic Gualter and a Robin
 Goodfellow; for under this name am I welcome in all choice companies of
 Pantagruelists. It was upbraided to Demosthenes by an envious surly knave,
 that his Orations did smell like the sarpler or wrapper of a foul and
 filthy oil-vessel. For this cause interpret you all my deeds and sayings
 in the perfectest sense; reverence the cheese-like brain that feeds you
 with these fair billevezees and trifling jollities, and do what lies in
 you to keep me always merry. Be frolic now, my lads, cheer up your hearts,
 and joyfully read the rest, with all the ease of your body and profit of
 your reins. But hearken, joltheads, you viedazes, or dickens take ye,
 remember to drink a health to me for the like favour again, and I will
 pledge you instantly, Tout ares-metys.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rabelais to the Reader.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Good friends, my Readers, who peruse this Book, Be not offended, whilst on
 it you look: Denude yourselves of all depraved affection, For it contains
 no badness, nor infection: 'Tis true that it brings forth to you no birth
 Of any value, but in point of mirth; Thinking therefore how sorrow might
 your mind Consume, I could no apter subject find; One inch of joy
 surmounts of grief a span; Because to laugh is proper to the man.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.I.?Of the Genealogy and Antiquity of Gargantua.
 </h2>
 <p>
 I must refer you to the great chronicle of Pantagruel for the knowledge of
 that genealogy and antiquity of race by which Gargantua is come unto us.
 In it you may understand more at large how the giants were born in this
 world, and how from them by a direct line issued Gargantua, the father of
 Pantagruel: and do not take it ill, if for this time I pass by it,
 although the subject be such, that the oftener it were remembered, the
 more it would please your worshipful Seniorias; according to which you
 have the authority of Plato in Philebo and Gorgias; and of Flaccus, who
 says that there are some kinds of purposes (such as these are without
 doubt), which, the frequentlier they be repeated, still prove the more
 delectable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Would to God everyone had as certain knowledge of his genealogy since the
 time of the ark of Noah until this age. I think many are at this day
 emperors, kings, dukes, princes, and popes on the earth, whose extraction
 is from some porters and pardon-pedlars; as, on the contrary, many are now
 poor wandering beggars, wretched and miserable, who are descended of the
 blood and lineage of great kings and emperors, occasioned, as I conceive
 it, by the transport and revolution of kingdoms and empires, from the
 Assyrians to the Medes, from the Medes to the Persians, from the Persians
 to the Macedonians, from the Macedonians to the Romans, from the Romans to
 the Greeks, from the Greeks to the French.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And to give you some hint concerning myself, who speaks unto you, I cannot
 think but I am come of the race of some rich king or prince in former
 times; for never yet saw you any man that had a greater desire to be a
 king, and to be rich, than I have, and that only that I may make good
 cheer, do nothing, nor care for anything, and plentifully enrich my
 friends, and all honest and learned men. But herein do I comfort myself,
 that in the other world I shall be so, yea and greater too than at this
 present I dare wish. As for you, with the same or a better conceit
 consolate yourselves in your distresses, and drink fresh if you can come
 by it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To return to our wethers, I say that by the sovereign gift of heaven, the
 antiquity and genealogy of Gargantua hath been reserved for our use more
 full and perfect than any other except that of the Messias, whereof I mean
 not to speak; for it belongs not unto my purpose, and the devils, that is
 to say, the false accusers and dissembled gospellers, will therein oppose
 me. This genealogy was found by John Andrew in a meadow, which he had near
 the pole-arch, under the olive-tree, as you go to Narsay: where, as he was
 making cast up some ditches, the diggers with their mattocks struck
 against a great brazen tomb, and unmeasurably long, for they could never
 find the end thereof, by reason that it entered too far within the sluices
 of Vienne. Opening this tomb in a certain place thereof, sealed on the top
 with the mark of a goblet, about which was written in Etrurian letters Hic
 Bibitur, they found nine flagons set in such order as they use to rank
 their kyles in Gascony, of which that which was placed in the middle had
 under it a big, fat, great, grey, pretty, small, mouldy, little pamphlet,
 smelling stronger, but no better than roses. In that book the said
 genealogy was found written all at length, in a chancery hand, not in
 paper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in the bark of an elm-tree, yet
 so worn with the long tract of time, that hardly could three letters
 together be there perfectly discerned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I (though unworthy) was sent for thither, and with much help of those
 spectacles, whereby the art of reading dim writings, and letters that do
 not clearly appear to the sight, is practised, as Aristotle teacheth it,
 did translate the book as you may see in your Pantagruelizing, that is to
 say, in drinking stiffly to your own heart's desire, and reading the
 dreadful and horrific acts of Pantagruel. At the end of the book there was
 a little treatise entitled the Antidoted Fanfreluches, or a Galimatia of
 extravagant conceits. The rats and moths, or (that I may not lie) other
 wicked beasts, had nibbled off the beginning: the rest I have hereto
 subjoined, for the reverence I bear to antiquity.

 bears, Heads would be free from tingling in the ears, To baffle the whole
 storehouse of abuses. The thus farewell Apollo and the Muses.

 Chapter 1.III.?How Gargantua was carried eleven months in his
 mother's belly.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Grangousier was a good fellow in his time, and notable jester; he loved to
 drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would
 willingly eat salt meat. To this intent he was ordinarily well furnished
 with gammons of bacon, both of Westphalia, Mayence and Bayonne, with store
 of dried neat's tongues, plenty of links, chitterlings and puddings in
 their season; together with salt beef and mustard, a good deal of hard
 roes of powdered mullet called botargos, great provision of sausages, not
 of Bolonia (for he feared the Lombard Boccone), but of Bigorre,
 Longaulnay, Brene, and Rouargue. In the vigour of his age he married
 Gargamelle, daughter to the King of the Parpaillons, a jolly pug, and
 well-mouthed wench. These two did oftentimes do the two-backed beast
 together, joyfully rubbing and frotting their bacon 'gainst one another,
 in so far, that at last she became great with child of a fair son, and
 went with him unto the eleventh month; for so long, yea longer, may a
 woman carry her great belly, especially when it is some masterpiece of
 nature, and a person predestinated to the performance, in his due time, of
 great exploits. As Homer says, that the child, which Neptune begot upon
 the nymph, was born a whole year after the conception, that is, in the
 twelfth month. For, as Aulus Gellius saith, lib. 3, this long time was
 suitable to the majesty of Neptune, that in it the child might receive his
 perfect form. For the like reason Jupiter made the night, wherein he lay
 with Alcmena, last forty-eight hours, a shorter time not being sufficient
 for the forging of Hercules, who cleansed the world of the monsters and
 tyrants wherewith it was suppressed. My masters, the ancient
 Pantagruelists, have confirmed that which I say, and withal declared it to
 be not only possible, but also maintained the lawful birth and
 legitimation of the infant born of a woman in the eleventh month after the
 decease of her husband. Hypocrates, lib. de alimento. Plinius, lib. 7,
 cap. 5. Plautus, in his Cistelleria. Marcus Varro, in his satire inscribed
 The Testament, alleging to this purpose the authority of Aristotle.
 Censorinus, lib. de die natali. Arist. lib. 7, cap. 3 &amp; 4, de natura
 animalium. Gellius, lib. 3, cap. 16. Servius, in his exposition upon this
 verse of Virgil's eclogues, Matri longa decem, &amp;c., and a thousand
 other fools, whose number hath been increased by the lawyers ff. de suis,
 et legit l. intestato. paragrapho. fin. and in Auth. de restitut. et ea
 quae parit in xi mense. Moreover upon these grounds they have foisted in
 their Robidilardic, or Lapiturolive law. Gallus ff. de lib. et posth. l.
 sept. ff. de stat. hom., and some other laws, which at this time I dare
 not name. By means whereof the honest widows may without danger play at
 the close buttock game with might and main, and as hard as they can, for
 the space of the first two months after the decease of their husbands. I
 pray you, my good lusty springal lads, if you find any of these females,
 that are worth the pains of untying the codpiece-point, get up, ride upon
 them, and bring them to me; for, if they happen within the third month to
 conceive, the child should be heir to the deceased, if, before he died, he
 had no other children, and the mother shall pass for an honest woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she is known to have conceived, thrust forward boldly, spare her not,
 whatever betide you, seeing the paunch is full. As Julia, the daughter of
 the Emperor Octavian, never prostituted herself to her belly-bumpers, but
 when she found herself with child, after the manner of ships, that receive
 not their steersman till they have their ballast and lading. And if any
 blame them for this their rataconniculation, and reiterated lechery upon
 their pregnancy and big-belliedness, seeing beasts, in the like exigent of
 their fulness, will never suffer the male-masculant to encroach them,
 their answer will be, that those are beasts, but they are women, very well
 skilled in the pretty vales and small fees of the pleasant trade and
 mysteries of superfetation: as Populia heretofore answered, according to
 the relation of Macrobius, lib. 2. Saturnal. If the devil will not have
 them to bag, he must wring hard the spigot, and stop the bung-hole.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.IV.?-How Gargamelle, being great with Gargantua, did eat a
 huge deal of tripes.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The occasion and manner how Gargamelle was brought to bed, and delivered
 of her child, was thus: and, if you do not believe it, I wish your bum-gut
 fall out and make an escapade. Her bum-gut, indeed, or fundament escaped
 her in an afternoon, on the third day of February, with having eaten at
 dinner too many godebillios. Godebillios are the fat tripes of coiros.
 Coiros are beeves fattened at the cratch in ox-stalls, or in the fresh
 guimo meadows. Guimo meadows are those that for their fruitfulness may be
 mowed twice a year. Of those fat beeves they had killed three hundred
 sixty-seven thousand and fourteen, to be salted at Shrovetide, that in the
 entering of the spring they might have plenty of powdered beef, wherewith
 to season their mouths at the beginning of their meals, and to taste their
 wine the better.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They had abundance of tripes, as you have heard, and they were so
 delicious, that everyone licked his fingers. But the mischief was this,
 that, for all men could do, there was no possibility to keep them long in
 that relish; for in a very short while they would have stunk, which had
 been an undecent thing. It was therefore concluded, that they should be
 all of them gulched up, without losing anything. To this effect they
 invited all the burghers of Sainais, of Suille, of the Roche-Clermaud, of
 Vaugaudry, without omitting the Coudray, Monpensier, the Gue de Vede, and
 other their neighbours, all stiff drinkers, brave fellows, and good
 players at the kyles. The good man Grangousier took great pleasure in
 their company, and commanded there should be no want nor pinching for
 anything. Nevertheless he bade his wife eat sparingly, because she was
 near her time, and that these tripes were no very commendable meat. They
 would fain, said he, be at the chewing of ordure, that would eat the case
 wherein it was. Notwithstanding these admonitions, she did eat sixteen
 quarters, two bushels, three pecks and a pipkin full. O the fair fecality
 wherewith she swelled, by the ingrediency of such shitten stuff!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After dinner they all went out in a hurl to the grove of the willows,
 where, on the green grass, to the sound of the merry flutes and pleasant
 bagpipes, they danced so gallantly, that it was a sweet and heavenly sport
 to see them so frolic.

 <p>
 Then did they fall upon the chat of victuals and some belly furniture to
 be snatched at in the very same place. Which purpose was no sooner
 mentioned, but forthwith began flagons to go, gammons to trot, goblets to
 fly, great bowls to ting, glasses to ring. Draw, reach, fill, mix, give it
 me without water. So, my friend, so, whip me off this glass neatly, bring
 me hither some claret, a full weeping glass till it run over. A cessation
 and truce with thirst. Ha, thou false fever, wilt thou not be gone? By my
 figgins, godmother, I cannot as yet enter in the humour of being merry,
 nor drink so currently as I would. You have catched a cold, gammer? Yea,
 forsooth, sir. By the belly of Sanct Buff, let us talk of our drink: I
 never drink but at my hours, like the Pope's mule. And I never drink but
 in my breviary, like a fair father guardian. Which was first, thirst or
 drinking? Thirst, for who in the time of innocence would have drunk
 without being athirst? Nay, sir, it was drinking; for privatio
 praesupponit habitum. I am learned, you see: Foecundi calices quem non
 fecere disertum? We poor innocents drink but too much without thirst. Not
 I truly, who am a sinner, for I never drink without thirst, either present
 or future. To prevent it, as you know, I drink for the thirst to come. I
 drink eternally. This is to me an eternity of drinking, and drinking of
 eternity. Let us sing, let us drink, and tune up our roundelays. Where is
 my funnel? What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney? Do you wet
 yourselves to dry, or do you dry to wet you? Pish, I understand not the
 rhetoric (theoric, I should say), but I help myself somewhat by the
 practice. Baste! enough! I sup, I wet, I humect, I moisten my gullet, I
 drink, and all for fear of dying. Drink always and you shall never die. If
 I drink not, I am a-ground, dry, gravelled and spent. I am stark dead
 without drink, and my soul ready to fly into some marsh amongst frogs; the
 soul never dwells in a dry place, drouth kills it. O you butlers, creators
 of new forms, make me of no drinker a drinker, a perennity and
 everlastingness of sprinkling and bedewing me through these my parched and
 sinewy bowels. He drinks in vain that feels not the pleasure of it. This
 entereth into my veins,?the pissing tools and urinal vessels shall
 have nothing of it. I would willingly wash the tripes of the calf which I
 apparelled this morning. I have pretty well now ballasted my stomach and
 stuffed my paunch. If the papers of my bonds and bills could drink as well
 as I do, my creditors would not want for wine when they come to see me, or
 when they are to make any formal exhibition of their rights to what of me
 they can demand. This hand of yours spoils your nose. O how many other
 such will enter here before this go out! What, drink so shallow? It is
 enough to break both girds and petrel. This is called a cup of
 dissimulation, or flagonal hypocrisy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What difference is there between a bottle and a flagon. Great difference;
 for the bottle is stopped and shut up with a stopple, but the flagon with
 a vice (La bouteille est fermee a bouchon, et le flaccon a vis.). Bravely
 and well played upon the words! Our fathers drank lustily, and emptied
 their cans. Well cacked, well sung! Come, let us drink: will you send
 nothing to the river? Here is one going to wash the tripes. I drink no
 more than a sponge. I drink like a Templar knight. And I, tanquam sponsus.
 And I, sicut terra sine aqua. Give me a synonymon for a gammon of bacon.
 It is the compulsory of drinkers: it is a pulley. By a pulley-rope wine is
 let down into a cellar, and by a gammon into the stomach. Hey! now, boys,
 hither, some drink, some drink. There is no trouble in it. Respice
 personam, pone pro duos, bus non est in usu. If I could get up as well as
 I can swallow down, I had been long ere now very high in the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus became Tom Tosspot rich,?thus went in the tailor's stitch. Thus
 did Bacchus conquer th' Inde?thus Philosophy, Melinde. A little rain
 allays a great deal of wind: long tippling breaks the thunder. But if
 there came such liquor from my ballock, would you not willingly thereafter
 suck the udder whence it issued? Here, page, fill! I prithee, forget me
 not when it comes to my turn, and I will enter the election I have made of
 thee into the very register of my heart. Sup, Guillot, and spare not,
 there is somewhat in the pot. I appeal from thirst, and disclaim its
 jurisdiction. Page, sue out my appeal in form. This remnant in the bottom
 of the glass must follow its leader. I was wont heretofore to drink out
 all, but now I leave nothing. Let us not make too much haste; it is
 requisite we carry all along with us. Heyday, here are tripes fit for our
 sport, and, in earnest, excellent godebillios of the dun ox (you know)
 with the black streak. O, for God's sake, let us lash them soundly, yet
 thriftily. Drink, or I will,?No, no, drink, I beseech you (Ou je
 vous, je vous prie.). Sparrows will not eat unless you bob them on the
 tail, nor can I drink if I be not fairly spoke to. The concavities of my
 body are like another Hell for their capacity. Lagonaedatera (lagon
 lateris cavitas: aides orcus: and eteros alter.). There is not a corner,
 nor coney-burrow in all my body, where this wine doth not ferret out my
 thirst. Ho, this will bang it soundly. But this shall banish it utterly.
 Let us wind our horns by the sound of flagons and bottles, and cry aloud,
 that whoever hath lost his thirst come not hither to seek it. Long
 clysters of drinking are to be voided without doors. The great God made
 the planets, and we make the platters neat. I have the word of the gospel
 in my mouth, Sitio. The stone called asbestos is not more unquenchable
 than the thirst of my paternity. Appetite comes with eating, says
 Angeston, but the thirst goes away with drinking. I have a remedy against
 thirst, quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a mad
 dog. Keep running after a dog, and he will never bite you; drink always
 before the thirst, and it will never come upon you. There I catch you, I
 awake you. Argus had a hundred eyes for his sight, a butler should have
 (like Briareus) a hundred hands wherewith to fill us wine indefatigably.
 Hey now, lads, let us moisten ourselves, it will be time to dry hereafter.
 White wine here, wine, boys! Pour out all in the name of Lucifer, fill
 here, you, fill and fill (peascods on you) till it be full. My tongue
 peels. Lans trinque; to thee, countryman, I drink to thee, good fellow,
 comrade to thee, lusty, lively! Ha, la, la, that was drunk to some
 purpose, and bravely gulped over. O lachryma Christi, it is of the best
 grape! I'faith, pure Greek, Greek! O the fine white wine! upon my
 conscience, it is a kind of taffetas wine,?hin, hin, it is of one
 ear, well wrought, and of good wool. Courage, comrade, up thy heart,
 billy! We will not be beasted at this bout, for I have got one trick. Ex
 hoc in hoc. There is no enchantment nor charm there, every one of you hath
 seen it. My 'prenticeship is out, I am a free man at this trade. I am
 prester mast (Prestre mace, maistre passe.), Prish, Brum! I should say,
 master past. O the drinkers, those that are a-dry, O poor thirsty souls!
 Good page, my friend, fill me here some, and crown the wine, I pray thee.
 Like a cardinal! Natura abhorret vacuum. Would you say that a fly could
 drink in this? This is after the fashion of Switzerland. Clear off, neat,
 supernaculum! Come, therefore, blades, to this divine liquor and celestial
 juice, swill it over heartily, and spare not! It is a decoction of nectar
 and ambrosia.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.VI.?How Gargantua was born in a strange manner.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Whilst they were on this discourse and pleasant tattle of drinking,
 Gargamelle began to be a little unwell in her lower parts; whereupon
 Grangousier arose from off the grass, and fell to comfort her very
 honestly and kindly, suspecting that she was in travail, and told her that
 it was best for her to sit down upon the grass under the willows, because
 she was like very shortly to see young feet, and that therefore it was
 convenient she should pluck up her spirits, and take a good heart of new
 at the fresh arrival of her baby; saying to her withal, that although the
 pain was somewhat grievous to her, it would be but of short continuance,
 and that the succeeding joy would quickly remove that sorrow, in such sort
 that she should not so much as remember it. On, with a sheep's courage!
 quoth he. Despatch this boy, and we will speedily fall to work for the
 making of another. Ha! said she, so well as you speak at your own ease,
 you that are men! Well, then, in the name of God, I'll do my best, seeing
 that you will have it so, but would to God that it were cut off from you!
 What? said Grangousier. Ha, said she, you are a good man indeed, you
 understand it well enough. What, my member? said he. By the goat's blood,
 if it please you, that shall be done instantly; cause bring hither a
 knife. Alas, said she, the Lord forbid, and pray Jesus to forgive me! I
 did not say it from my heart, therefore let it alone, and do not do it
 neither more nor less any kind of harm for my speaking so to you. But I am
 like to have work enough to do to-day and all for your member, yet God
 bless you and it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Courage, courage, said he, take you no care of the matter, let the four
 foremost oxen do the work. I will yet go drink one whiff more, and if in
 the mean time anything befall you that may require my presence, I will be
 so near to you, that, at the first whistling in your fist, I shall be with
 you forthwith. A little while after she began to groan, lament and cry.
 Then suddenly came the midwives from all quarters, who groping her below,
 found some peloderies, which was a certain filthy stuff, and of a taste
 truly bad enough. This they thought had been the child, but it was her
 fundament, that was slipped out with the mollification of her straight
 entrail, which you call the bum-gut, and that merely by eating of too many
 tripes, as we have showed you before. Whereupon an old ugly trot in the
 company, who had the repute of an expert she-physician, and was come from
 Brisepaille, near to Saint Genou, three score years before, made her so
 horrible a restrictive and binding medicine, and whereby all her larris,
 arse-pipes, and conduits were so oppilated, stopped, obstructed, and
 contracted, that you could hardly have opened and enlarged them with your
 teeth, which is a terrible thing to think upon; seeing the Devil at the
 mass at Saint Martin's was puzzled with the like task, when with his teeth
 he had lengthened out the parchment whereon he wrote the tittle-tattle of
 two young mangy whores. By this inconvenient the cotyledons of her matrix
 were presently loosed, through which the child sprang up and leaped, and
 so, entering into the hollow vein, did climb by the diaphragm even above
 her shoulders, where the vein divides itself into two, and from thence
 taking his way towards the left side, issued forth at her left ear. As
 soon as he was born, he cried not as other babes use to do, Miez, miez,
 miez, miez, but with a high, sturdy, and big voice shouted about, Some
 drink, some drink, some drink, as inviting all the world to drink with
 him. The noise hereof was so extremely great, that it was heard in both
 the countries at once of Beauce and Bibarois. I doubt me, that you do not
 thoroughly believe the truth of this strange nativity. Though you believe
 it not, I care not much: but an honest man, and of good judgment,
 believeth still what is told him, and that which he finds written.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Is this beyond our law or our faith?against reason or the holy
 Scripture? For my part, I find nothing in the sacred Bible that is against
 it. But tell me, if it had been the will of God, would you say that he
 could not do it? Ha, for favour sake, I beseech you, never emberlucock or
 inpulregafize your spirits with these vain thoughts and idle conceits; for
 I tell you, it is not impossible with God, and, if he pleased, all women
 henceforth should bring forth their children at the ear. Was not Bacchus
 engendered out of the very thigh of Jupiter? Did not Roquetaillade come
 out at his mother's heel, and Crocmoush from the slipper of his nurse? Was
 not Minerva born of the brain, even through the ear of Jove? Adonis, of
 the bark of a myrrh tree; and Castor and Pollux of the doupe of that egg
 which was laid and hatched by Leda? But you would wonder more, and with
 far greater amazement, if I should now present you with that chapter of
 Plinius, wherein he treateth of strange births, and contrary to nature,
 and yet am not I so impudent a liar as he was. Read the seventh book of
 his Natural History, chap.3, and trouble not my head any more about this.

 <p>
 The good man Grangousier, drinking and making merry with the rest, heard
 the horrible noise which his son had made as he entered into the light of
 this world, when he cried out, Some drink, some drink, some drink;
 whereupon he said in French, Que grand tu as et souple le gousier! that is
 to say, How great and nimble a throat thou hast. Which the company
 hearing, said that verily the child ought to be called Gargantua; because
 it was the first word that after his birth his father had spoke, in
 imitation, and at the example of the ancient Hebrews; whereunto he
 condescended, and his mother was very well pleased therewith. In the
 meanwhile, to quiet the child, they gave him to drink a tirelaregot, that
 is, till his throat was like to crack with it; then was he carried to the
 font, and there baptized, according to the manner of good Christians.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Immediately thereafter were appointed for him seventeen thousand, nine
 hundred, and thirteen cows of the towns of Pautille and Brehemond, to
 furnish him with milk in ordinary, for it was impossible to find a nurse
 sufficient for him in all the country, considering the great quantity of
 milk that was requisite for his nourishment; although there were not
 wanting some doctors of the opinion of Scotus, who affirmed that his own
 mother gave him suck, and that she could draw out of her breasts one
 thousand, four hundred, two pipes, and nine pails of milk at every time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Which indeed is not probable, and this point hath been found duggishly
 scandalous and offensive to tender ears, for that it savoured a little of
 heresy. Thus was he handled for one year and ten months; after which time,
 by the advice of physicians, they began to carry him, and then was made
 for him a fine little cart drawn with oxen, of the invention of Jan Denio,
 wherein they led him hither and thither with great joy; and he was worth
 the seeing, for he was a fine boy, had a burly physiognomy, and almost ten
 chins. He cried very little, but beshit himself every hour: for, to speak
 truly of him, he was wonderfully phlegmatic in his posteriors, both by
 reason of his natural complexion and the accidental disposition which had
 befallen him by his too much quaffing of the Septembral juice. Yet without
 a cause did not he sup one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry,
 displeased, or sorry, if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and
 what grievous quarter soever he kept, in bringing him some drink, he would
 be instantly pacified, reseated in his own temper, in a good humour again,
 and as still and quiet as ever. One of his governesses told me (swearing
 by her fig), how he was so accustomed to this kind of way, that, at the
 sound of pints and flagons, he would on a sudden fall into an ecstasy, as
 if he had then tasted of the joys of paradise; so that they, upon
 consideration of this, his divine complexion, would every morning, to
 cheer him up, play with a knife upon the glasses, on the bottles with
 their stopples, and on the pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the
 sound whereof he became gay, did leap for joy, would loll and rock himself
 in the cradle, then nod with his head, monochordizing with his fingers,
 and barytonizing with his tail.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.VIII.?How they apparelled Gargantua.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Being of this age, his father ordained to have clothes made to him in his
 own livery, which was white and blue. To work then went the tailors, and
 with great expedition were those clothes made, cut, and sewed, according
 to the fashion that was then in request. I find by the ancient records or
 pancarts, to be seen in the chamber of accounts, or court of the exchequer
 at Montsoreau, that he was accoutred in manner as followeth. To make him
 every shirt of his were taken up nine hundred ells of Chasteleraud linen,
 and two hundred for the gussets, in manner of cushions, which they put
 under his armpits. His shirt was not gathered nor plaited, for the
 plaiting of shirts was not found out till the seamstresses (when the point
 of their needle (Besongner du cul, Englished The eye of the needle.) was
 broken) began to work and occupy with the tail. There were taken up for
 his doublet, eight hundred and thirteen ells of white satin, and for his
 points fifteen hundred and nine dogs' skins and a half. Then was it that
 men began to tie their breeches to their doublets, and not their doublets
 to their breeches: for it is against nature, as hath most amply been
 showed by Ockham upon the exponibles of Master Haultechaussade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For his breeches were taken up eleven hundred and five ells and a third of
 white broadcloth. They were cut in the form of pillars, chamfered,
 channelled and pinked behind that they might not over-heat his reins: and
 were, within the panes, puffed out with the lining of as much blue damask
 as was needful: and remark, that he had very good leg-harness,
 proportionable to the rest of his stature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For his codpiece were used sixteen ells and a quarter of the same cloth,
 and it was fashioned on the top like unto a triumphant arch, most
 gallantly fastened with two enamelled clasps, in each of which was set a
 great emerald, as big as an orange; for, as says Orpheus, lib. de
 lapidibus, and Plinius, libro ultimo, it hath an erective virtue and
 comfortative of the natural member. The exiture, outjecting or
 outstanding, of his codpiece was of the length of a yard, jagged and
 pinked, and withal bagging, and strutting out with the blue damask lining,
 after the manner of his breeches. But had you seen the fair embroidery of
 the small needlework purl, and the curiously interlaced knots, by the
 goldsmith's art set out and trimmed with rich diamonds, precious rubies,
 fine turquoises, costly emeralds, and Persian pearls, you would have
 compared it to a fair cornucopia, or horn of abundance, such as you see in
 antiques, or as Rhea gave to the two nymphs, Amalthea and Ida, the nurses
 of Jupiter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And, like to that horn of abundance, it was still gallant, succulent,
 droppy, sappy, pithy, lively, always flourishing, always fructifying, full
 of juice, full of flower, full of fruit, and all manner of delight. I avow
 God, it would have done one good to have seen him, but I will tell you
 more of him in the book which I have made of the dignity of codpieces. One
 thing I will tell you, that as it was both long and large, so was it well
 furnished and victualled within, nothing like unto the hypocritical
 codpieces of some fond wooers and wench-courtiers, which are stuffed only
 with wind, to the great prejudice of the female sex.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For his shoes were taken up four hundred and six ells of blue
 crimson-velvet, and were very neatly cut by parallel lines, joined in
 uniform cylinders. For the soling of them were made use of eleven hundred
 hides of brown cows, shapen like the tail of a keeling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For his coat were taken up eighteen hundred ells of blue velvet, dyed in
 grain, embroidered in its borders with fair gilliflowers, in the middle
 decked with silver purl, intermixed with plates of gold and store of
 pearls, hereby showing that in his time he would prove an especial good
 fellow and singular whipcan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His girdle was made of three hundred ells and a half of silken serge, half
 white and half blue, if I mistake it not. His sword was not of Valentia,
 nor his dagger of Saragossa, for his father could not endure these
 hidalgos borrachos maranisados como diablos: but he had a fair sword made
 of wood, and the dagger of boiled leather, as well painted and gilded as
 any man could wish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His purse was made of the cod of an elephant, which was given him by Herr
 Pracontal, proconsul of Lybia.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For his gown were employed nine thousand six hundred ells, wanting
 two-thirds, of blue velvet, as before, all so diagonally purled, that by
 true perspective issued thence an unnamed colour, like that you see in the
 necks of turtle-doves or turkey-cocks, which wonderfully rejoiced the eyes
 of the beholders. For his bonnet or cap were taken up three hundred, two
 ells and a quarter of white velvet, and the form thereof was wide and
 round, of the bigness of his head; for his father said that the caps of
 the Marrabaise fashion, made like the cover of a pasty, would one time or
 other bring a mischief on those that wore them. For his plume, he wore a
 fair great blue feather, plucked from an onocrotal of the country of
 Hircania the wild, very prettily hanging down over his right ear. For the
 jewel or brooch which in his cap he carried, he had in a cake of gold,
 weighing three score and eight marks, a fair piece enamelled, wherein was
 portrayed a man's body with two heads, looking towards one another, four
 arms, four feet, two arses, such as Plato, in Symposio, says was the
 mystical beginning of man's nature; and about it was written in Ionic
 letters, Agame ou zetei ta eautes, or rather, Aner kai gune zugada
 anthrotos idiaitata, that is, Vir et mulier junctim propriissime homo. To
 wear about his neck, he had a golden chain, weighing twenty-five thousand
 and sixty-three marks of gold, the links thereof being made after the
 manner of great berries, amongst which were set in work green jaspers
 engraven and cut dragon-like, all environed with beams and sparks, as king
 Nicepsos of old was wont to wear them: and it reached down to the very
 bust of the rising of his belly, whereby he reaped great benefit all his
 life long, as the Greek physicians know well enough. For his gloves were
 put in work sixteen otters' skins, and three of the loupgarous, or
 men-eating wolves, for the bordering of them: and of this stuff were they
 made, by the appointment of the Cabalists of Sanlouand. As for the rings
 which his father would have him to wear, to renew the ancient mark of
 nobility, he had on the forefinger of his left hand a carbuncle as big as
 an ostrich's egg, enchased very daintily in gold of the fineness of a
 Turkey seraph. Upon the middle finger of the same hand he had a ring made
 of four metals together, of the strangest fashion that ever was seen; so
 that the steel did not crash against the gold, nor the silver crush the
 copper. All this was made by Captain Chappuys, and Alcofribas his good
 agent. On the medical finger of his right hand he had a ring made
 spire-wise, wherein was set a perfect Balas ruby, a pointed diamond, and a
 Physon emerald, of an inestimable value. For Hans Carvel, the king of
 Melinda's jeweller, esteemed them at the rate of threescore nine millions,
 eight hundred ninety-four thousand, and eighteen French crowns of Berry,
 and at so much did the Foucres of Augsburg prize them.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.IX.?The colours and liveries of Gargantua.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Gargantua's colours were white and blue, as I have showed you before, by
 which his father would give us to understand that his son to him was a
 heavenly joy; for the white did signify gladness, pleasure, delight, and
 rejoicing, and the blue, celestial things. I know well enough that, in
 reading this, you laugh at the old drinker, and hold this exposition of
 colours to be very extravagant, and utterly disagreeable to reason,
 because white is said to signify faith, and blue constancy. But without
 moving, vexing, heating, or putting you in a chafe (for the weather is
 dangerous), answer me, if it please you; for no other compulsory way of
 arguing will I use towards you, or any else; only now and then I will
 mention a word or two of my bottle. What is it that induceth you, what
 stirs you up to believe, or who told you that white signifieth faith, and
 blue constancy? An old paltry book, say you, sold by the hawking pedlars
 and balladmongers, entitled The Blason of Colours. Who made it? Whoever it
 was, he was wise in that he did not set his name to it. But, besides, I
 know not what I should rather admire in him, his presumption or his
 sottishness. His presumption and overweening, for that he should without
 reason, without cause, or without any appearance of truth, have dared to
 prescribe, by his private authority, what things should be denotated and
 signified by the colour: which is the custom of tyrants, who will have
 their will to bear sway in stead of equity, and not of the wise and
 learned, who with the evidence of reason satisfy their readers. His
 sottishness and want of spirit, in that he thought that, without any other
 demonstration or sufficient argument, the world would be pleased to make
 his blockish and ridiculous impositions the rule of their devices. In
 effect, according to the proverb, To a shitten tail fails never ordure, he
 hath found, it seems, some simple ninny in those rude times of old, when
 the wearing of high round bonnets was in fashion, who gave some trust to
 his writings, according to which they carved and engraved their
 apophthegms and mottoes, trapped and caparisoned their mules and
 sumpter-horses, apparelled their pages, quartered their breeches, bordered
 their gloves, fringed the curtains and valances of their beds, painted
 their ensigns, composed songs, and, which is worse, placed many deceitful
 jugglings and unworthy base tricks undiscoveredly amongst the very
 chastest matrons and most reverend sciences. In the like darkness and mist
 of ignorance are wrapped up these vain-glorious courtiers and
 name-transposers, who, going about in their impresas to signify esperance
 (that is, hope), have portrayed a sphere?and birds' pennes for pains?l'ancholie
 (which is the flower colombine) for melancholy?a waning moon or
 crescent, to show the increasing or rising of one's fortune?a bench
 rotten and broken, to signify bankrupt?non and a corslet for non dur
 habit (otherwise non durabit, it shall not last), un lit sans ciel, that
 is, a bed without a tester, for un licencie, a graduated person, as
 bachelor in divinity or utter barrister-at-law; which are equivocals so
 absurd and witless, so barbarous and clownish, that a fox's tail should be
 fastened to the neck-piece of, and a vizard made of a cowsherd given to
 everyone that henceforth should offer, after the restitution of learning,
 to make use of any such fopperies in France.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the same reasons (if reasons I should call them, and not ravings
 rather, and idle triflings about words), might I cause paint a pannier, to
 signify that I am in pain?a mustard-pot, that my heart tarries much
 for't?one pissing upwards for a bishop?the bottom of a pair of
 breeches for a vessel full of fart-hings?a codpiece for the office
 of the clerks of the sentences, decrees, or judgments, or rather, as the
 English bears it, for the tail of a codfish?and a dog's turd for the
 dainty turret wherein lies the love of my sweetheart. Far otherwise did
 heretofore the sages of Egypt, when they wrote by letters, which they
 called hieroglyphics, which none understood who were not skilled in the
 virtue, property, and nature of the things represented by them. Of which
 Orus Apollon hath in Greek composed two books, and Polyphilus, in his
 Dream of Love, set down more. In France you have a taste of them in the
 device or impresa of my Lord Admiral, which was carried before that time
 by Octavian Augustus. But my little skiff alongst these unpleasant gulfs
 and shoals will sail no further, therefore must I return to the port from
 whence I came. Yet do I hope one day to write more at large of these
 things, and to show both by philosophical arguments and authorities,
 received and approved of by and from all antiquity, what, and how many
 colours there are in nature, and what may be signified by every one of
 them, if God save the mould of my cap, which is my best wine-pot, as my
 grandam said.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.X.?Of that which is signified by the colours white and
 blue.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The white therefore signifieth joy, solace, and gladness, and that not at
 random, but upon just and very good grounds: which you may perceive to be
 true, if laying aside all prejudicate affections, you will but give ear to
 what presently I shall expound unto you.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Aristotle saith that, supposing two things contrary in their kind, as good
 and evil, virtue and vice, heat and cold, white and black, pleasure and
 pain, joy and grief,?and so of others,?if you couple them in
 such manner that the contrary of one kind may agree in reason with the
 contrary of the other, it must follow by consequence that the other
 contrary must answer to the remanent opposite to that wherewith it is
 conferred. As, for example, virtue and vice are contrary in one kind, so
 are good and evil. If one of the contraries of the first kind be consonant
 to one of those of the second, as virtue and goodness, for it is clear
 that virtue is good, so shall the other two contraries, which are evil and
 vice, have the same connection, for vice is evil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This logical rule being understood, take these two contraries, joy and
 sadness; then these other two, white and black, for they are physically
 contrary. If so be, then, that black do signify grief, by good reason then
 should white import joy. Nor is this signification instituted by human
 imposition, but by the universal consent of the world received, which
 philosophers call Jus Gentium, the Law of Nations, or an uncontrollable
 right of force in all countries whatsoever. For you know well enough that
 all people, and all languages and nations, except the ancient Syracusans
 and certain Argives, who had cross and thwarting souls, when they mean
 outwardly to give evidence of their sorrow, go in black; and all mourning
 is done with black. Which general consent is not without some argument and
 reason in nature, the which every man may by himself very suddenly
 comprehend, without the instruction of any?and this we call the law
 of nature. By virtue of the same natural instinct we know that by white
 all the world hath understood joy, gladness, mirth, pleasure, and delight.
 In former times the Thracians and Cretans did mark their good, propitious,
 and fortunate days with white stones, and their sad, dismal, and
 unfortunate ones with black. Is not the night mournful, sad, and
 melancholic? It is black and dark by the privation of light. Doth not the
 light comfort all the world? And it is more white than anything else.
 Which to prove, I could direct you to the book of Laurentius Valla against
 Bartolus; but an evangelical testimony I hope will content you. Matth. 17
 it is said that, at the transfiguration of our Lord, Vestimenta ejus facta
 sunt alba sicut lux, his apparel was made white like the light. By which
 lightsome whiteness he gave his three apostles to understand the idea and
 figure of the eternal joys; for by the light are all men comforted,
 according to the word of the old woman, who, although she had never a
 tooth in her head, was wont to say, Bona lux. And Tobit, chap.5, after he
 had lost his sight, when Raphael saluted him, answered, What joy can I
 have, that do not see the light of Heaven? In that colour did the angels
 testify the joy of the whole world at the resurrection of our Saviour,
 John 20, and at his ascension, Acts 1. With the like colour of vesture did
 St. John the Evangelist, Apoc. 4.7, see the faithful clothed in the
 heavenly and blessed Jerusalem.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Read the ancient, both Greek and Latin histories, and you shall find that
 the town of Alba (the first pattern of Rome) was founded and so named by
 reason of a white sow that was seen there. You shall likewise find in
 those stories, that when any man, after he had vanquished his enemies, was
 by decree of the senate to enter into Rome triumphantly, he usually rode
 in a chariot drawn by white horses: which in the ovation triumph was also
 the custom; for by no sign or colour would they so significantly express
 the joy of their coming as by the white. You shall there also find, how
 Pericles, the general of the Athenians, would needs have that part of his
 army unto whose lot befell the white beans, to spend the whole day in
 mirth, pleasure, and ease, whilst the rest were a-fighting. A thousand
 other examples and places could I allege to this purpose, but that it is
 not here where I should do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By understanding hereof, you may resolve one problem, which Alexander
 Aphrodiseus hath accounted unanswerable: why the lion, who with his only
 cry and roaring affrights all beasts, dreads and feareth only a white
 cock? For, as Proclus saith, Libro de Sacrificio et Magia, it is because
 the presence of the virtue of the sun, which is the organ and promptuary
 of all terrestrial and sidereal light, doth more symbolize and agree with
 a white cock, as well in regard of that colour, as of his property and
 specifical quality, than with a lion. He saith, furthermore, that devils
 have been often seen in the shape of lions, which at the sight of a white
 cock have presently vanished. This is the cause why Galli or Gallices (so
 are the Frenchmen called, because they are naturally white as milk, which
 the Greeks call Gala,) do willingly wear in their caps white feathers, for
 by nature they are of a candid disposition, merry, kind, gracious, and
 well-beloved, and for their cognizance and arms have the whitest flower of
 any, the Flower de luce or Lily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If you demand how, by white, nature would have us understand joy and
 gladness, I answer, that the analogy and uniformity is thus. For, as the
 white doth outwardly disperse and scatter the rays of the sight, whereby
 the optic spirits are manifestly dissolved, according to the opinion of
 Aristotle in his problems and perspective treatises; as you may likewise
 perceive by experience, when you pass over mountains covered with snow,
 how you will complain that you cannot see well; as Xenophon writes to have
 happened to his men, and as Galen very largely declareth, lib. 10, de usu
 partium: just so the heart with excessive joy is inwardly dilated, and
 suffereth a manifest resolution of the vital spirits, which may go so far
 on that it may thereby be deprived of its nourishment, and by consequence
 of life itself, by this perichary or extremity of gladness, as Galen
 saith, lib. 12, method, lib. 5, de locis affectis, and lib. 2, de
 symptomatum causis. And as it hath come to pass in former times, witness
 Marcus Tullius, lib. 1, Quaest. Tuscul., Verrius, Aristotle, Titus Livius,
 in his relation of the battle of Cannae, Plinius, lib. 7, cap. 32 and 34,
 A. Gellius, lib. 3, c. 15, and many other writers,?to Diagoras the
 Rhodian, Chilon, Sophocles, Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily, Philippides,
 Philemon, Polycrates, Philistion, M. Juventi, and others who died with
 joy. And as Avicen speaketh, in 2 canon et lib. de virib. cordis, of the
 saffron, that it doth so rejoice the heart that, if you take of it
 excessively, it will by a superfluous resolution and dilation deprive it
 altogether of life. Here peruse Alex. Aphrodiseus, lib. 1, Probl., cap.
 19, and that for a cause. But what? It seems I am entered further into
 this point than I intended at the first. Here, therefore, will I strike
 sail, referring the rest to that book of mine which handleth this matter
 to the full. Meanwhile, in a word I will tell you, that blue doth
 certainly signify heaven and heavenly things, by the same very tokens and
 symbols that white signifieth joy and pleasure.

 <!-- IMAGE END -->
 <p>
 Gargantua, from three years upwards unto five, was brought up and
 instructed in all convenient discipline by the commandment of his father;
 and spent that time like the other little children of the country, that
 is, in drinking, eating, and sleeping: in eating, sleeping, and drinking:
 and in sleeping, drinking, and eating. Still he wallowed and rolled up and
 down himself in the mire and dirt?he blurred and sullied his nose
 with filth?he blotted and smutched his face with any kind of scurvy
 stuff?he trod down his shoes in the heel?at the flies he did
 oftentimes yawn, and ran very heartily after the butterflies, the empire
 whereof belonged to his father. He pissed in his shoes, shit in his shirt,
 and wiped his nose on his sleeve?he did let his snot and snivel fall
 in his pottage, and dabbled, paddled, and slobbered everywhere?he
 would drink in his slipper, and ordinarily rub his belly against a
 pannier. He sharpened his teeth with a top, washed his hands with his
 broth, and combed his head with a bowl. He would sit down betwixt two
 stools, and his arse to the ground ?would cover himself with a wet
 sack, and drink in eating of his soup. He did eat his cake sometimes
 without bread, would bite in laughing, and laugh in biting. Oftentimes did
 he spit in the basin, and fart for fatness, piss against the sun, and hide
 himself in the water for fear of rain. He would strike out of the cold
 iron, be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle it. He would flay the
 fox, say the ape's paternoster, return to his sheep, and turn the hogs to
 the hay. He would beat the dogs before the lion, put the plough before the
 oxen, and claw where it did not itch. He would pump one to draw somewhat
 out of him, by griping all would hold fast nothing, and always eat his
 white bread first. He shoed the geese, kept a self-tickling to make
 himself laugh, and was very steadable in the kitchen: made a mock at the
 gods, would cause sing Magnificat at matins, and found it very convenient
 so to do. He would eat cabbage, and shite beets,?knew flies in a
 dish of milk, and would make them lose their feet. He would scrape paper,
 blur parchment, then run away as hard as he could. He would pull at the
 kid's leather, or vomit up his dinner, then reckon without his host. He
 would beat the bushes without catching the birds, thought the moon was
 made of green cheese, and that bladders are lanterns. Out of one sack he
 would take two moultures or fees for grinding; would act the ass's part to
 get some bran, and of his fist would make a mallet. He took the cranes at
 the first leap, and would have the mail-coats to be made link after link.
 He always looked a given horse in the mouth, leaped from the cock to the
 ass, and put one ripe between two green. By robbing Peter he paid Paul, he
 kept the moon from the wolves, and hoped to catch larks if ever the
 heavens should fall. He did make of necessity virtue, of such bread such
 pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven. Every
 morning he did cast up his gorge, and his father's little dogs eat out of
 the dish with him, and he with them. He would bite their ears, and they
 would scratch his nose?he would blow in their arses, and they would
 lick his chaps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But hearken, good fellows, the spigot ill betake you, and whirl round your
 brains, if you do not give ear! This little lecher was always groping his
 nurses and governesses, upside down, arsiversy, topsyturvy, harri
 bourriquet, with a Yacco haick, hyck gio! handling them very rudely in
 jumbling and tumbling them to keep them going; for he had already begun to
 exercise the tools, and put his codpiece in practice. Which codpiece, or
 braguette, his governesses did every day deck up and adorn with fair
 nosegays, curious rubies, sweet flowers, and fine silken tufts, and very
 pleasantly would pass their time in taking you know what between their
 fingers, and dandling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and
 stiffness of a suppository, or street magdaleon, which is a hard rolled-up
 salve spread upon leather. Then did they burst out in laughing, when they
 saw it lift up its ears, as if the sport had liked them. One of them would
 call it her little dille, her staff of love, her quillety, her faucetin,
 her dandilolly. Another, her peen, her jolly kyle, her bableret, her
 membretoon, her quickset imp: another again, her branch of coral, her
 female adamant, her placket-racket, her Cyprian sceptre, her jewel for
 ladies. And some of the other women would give it these names,?my
 bunguetee, my stopple too, my bush-rusher, my gallant wimble, my pretty
 borer, my coney-burrow-ferret, my little piercer, my augretine, my
 dangling hangers, down right to it, stiff and stout, in and to, my pusher,
 dresser, pouting stick, my honey pipe, my pretty pillicock, linky pinky,
 futilletie, my lusty andouille, and crimson chitterling, my little couille
 bredouille, my pretty rogue, and so forth. It belongs to me, said one. It
 is mine, said the other. What, quoth a third, shall I have no share in it?
 By my faith, I will cut it then. Ha, to cut it, said the other, would hurt
 him. Madam, do you cut little children's things? Were his cut off, he
 would be then Monsieur sans queue, the curtailed master. And that he might
 play and sport himself after the manner of the other little children of
 the country, they made him a fair weather whirl-jack of the wings of the
 windmill of Myrebalais.

 <p>
 Afterwards, that he might be all his lifetime a good rider, they made to
 him a fair great horse of wood, which he did make leap, curvet, jerk out
 behind, and skip forward, all at a time: to pace, trot, rack, gallop,
 amble, to play the hobby, the hackney-gelding: go the gait of the camel,
 and of the wild ass. He made him also change his colour of hair, as the
 monks of Coultibo (according to the variety of their holidays) use to do
 their clothes, from bay brown, to sorrel, dapple-grey, mouse-dun,
 deer-colour, roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skewed colour, piebald, and the
 colour of the savage elk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Himself of a huge big post made a hunting nag, and another for daily
 service of the beam of a vinepress: and of a great oak made up a mule,
 with a footcloth, for his chamber. Besides this, he had ten or twelve
 spare horses, and seven horses for post; and all these were lodged in his
 own chamber, close by his bedside. One day the Lord of Breadinbag
 (Painensac.) came to visit his father in great bravery, and with a gallant
 train: and, at the same time, to see him came likewise the Duke of
 Freemeal (Francrepas.) and the Earl of Wetgullet (Mouillevent.). The house
 truly for so many guests at once was somewhat narrow, but especially the
 stables; whereupon the steward and harbinger of the said Lord Breadinbag,
 to know if there were any other empty stable in the house, came to
 Gargantua, a little young lad, and secretly asked him where the stables of
 the great horses were, thinking that children would be ready to tell all.
 Then he led them up along the stairs of the castle, passing by the second
 hall unto a broad great gallery, by which they entered into a large tower,
 and as they were going up at another pair of stairs, said the harbinger to
 the steward, This child deceives us, for the stables are never on the top
 of the house. You may be mistaken, said the steward, for I know some
 places at Lyons, at the Basmette, at Chaisnon, and elsewhere, which have
 their stables at the very tops of the houses: so it may be that behind the
 house there is a way to come to this ascent. But I will question with him
 further. Then said he to Gargantua, My pretty little boy, whither do you
 lead us? To the stable, said he, of my great horses. We are almost come to
 it; we have but these stairs to go up at. Then leading them alongst
 another great hall, he brought them into his chamber, and, opening the
 door, said unto them, This is the stable you ask for; this is my jennet;
 this is my gelding; this is my courser, and this is my hackney, and laid
 on them with a great lever. I will bestow upon you, said he, this
 Friesland horse; I had him from Frankfort, yet will I give him you; for he
 is a pretty little nag, and will go very well, with a tessel of goshawks,
 half a dozen of spaniels, and a brace of greyhounds: thus are you king of
 the hares and partridges for all this winter. By St. John, said they, now
 we are paid, he hath gleeked us to some purpose, bobbed we are now for
 ever. I deny it, said he,?he was not here above three days. Judge
 you now, whether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for
 shame, or to laugh at the jest. As they were going down again thus amazed,
 he asked them, Will you have a whimwham (Aubeliere.)? What is that, said
 they? It is, said he, five turds to make you a muzzle. To-day, said the
 steward, though we happen to be roasted, we shall not be burnt, for we are
 pretty well quipped and larded, in my opinion. O my jolly dapper boy, thou
 hast given us a gudgeon; I hope to see thee Pope before I die. I think so,
 said he, myself; and then shall you be a puppy, and this gentle popinjay a
 perfect papelard, that is, dissembler. Well, well, said the harbinger.
 But, said Gargantua, guess how many stitches there are in my mother's
 smock. Sixteen, quoth the harbinger. You do not speak gospel, said
 Gargantua, for there is cent before, and cent behind, and you did not
 reckon them ill, considering the two under holes. When? said the
 harbinger. Even then, said Gargantua, when they made a shovel of your nose
 to take up a quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel, wherewith to
 put it into another vessel, because the bottom of the old one was out.
 Cocksbod, said the steward, we have met with a prater. Farewell, master
 tattler, God keep you, so goodly are the words which you come out with,
 and so fresh in your mouth, that it had need to be salted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus going down in great haste, under the arch of the stairs they let fall
 the great lever, which he had put upon their backs; whereupon Gargantua
 said, What a devil! you are, it seems, but bad horsemen, that suffer your
 bilder to fail you when you need him most. If you were to go from hence to
 Cahusac, whether had you rather, ride on a gosling or lead a sow in a
 leash? I had rather drink, said the harbinger. With this they entered into
 the lower hall, where the company was, and relating to them this new
 story, they made them laugh like a swarm of flies.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XIII.?How Gargantua's wonderful understanding became known
 to his father Grangousier, by the invention of a torchecul or wipebreech.
 </h2>
 <p>
 About the end of the fifth year, Grangousier returning from the conquest
 of the Canarians, went by the way to see his son Gargantua. There was he
 filled with joy, as such a father might be at the sight of such a child of
 his: and whilst he kissed and embraced him, he asked many childish
 questions of him about divers matters, and drank very freely with him and
 with his governesses, of whom in great earnest he asked, amongst other
 things, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and sweet. To this
 Gargantua answered, that he had taken such a course for that himself, that
 in all the country there was not to be found a cleanlier boy than he. How
 is that? said Grangousier. I have, answered Gargantua, by a long and
 curious experience, found out a means to wipe my bum, the most lordly, the
 most excellent, and the most convenient that ever was seen. What is that?
 said Grangousier, how is it? I will tell you by-and-by, said Gargantua.
 Once I did wipe me with a gentle-woman's velvet mask, and found it to be
 good; for the softness of the silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to my
 fundament. Another time with one of their hoods, and in like manner that
 was comfortable. At another time with a lady's neckerchief, and after that
 I wiped me with some ear-pieces of hers made of crimson satin, but there
 was such a number of golden spangles in them (turdy round things, a pox
 take them) that they fetched away all the skin of my tail with a
 vengeance. Now I wish St. Antony's fire burn the bum-gut of the goldsmith
 that made them, and of her that wore them! This hurt I cured by wiping
 myself with a page's cap, garnished with a feather after the Switzers'
 fashion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Afterwards, in dunging behind a bush, I found a March-cat, and with it I
 wiped my breech, but her claws were so sharp that they scratched and
 exulcerated all my perinee. Of this I recovered the next morning
 thereafter, by wiping myself with my mother's gloves, of a most excellent
 perfume and scent of the Arabian Benin. After that I wiped me with sage,
 with fennel, with anet, with marjoram, with roses, with gourd-leaves, with
 beets, with colewort, with leaves of the vine-tree, with mallows,
 wool-blade, which is a tail-scarlet, with lettuce, and with spinach
 leaves. All this did very great good to my leg. Then with mercury, with
 parsley, with nettles, with comfrey, but that gave me the bloody flux of
 Lombardy, which I healed by wiping me with my braguette. Then I wiped my
 tail in the sheets, in the coverlet, in the curtains, with a cushion, with
 arras hangings, with a green carpet, with a table-cloth, with a napkin,
 with a handkerchief, with a combing-cloth; in all which I found more
 pleasure than do the mangy dogs when you rub them. Yea, but, said
 Grangousier, which torchecul did you find to be the best? I was coming to
 it, said Gargantua, and by-and-by shall you hear the tu autem, and know
 the whole mystery and knot of the matter. I wiped myself with hay, with
 straw, with thatch-rushes, with flax, with wool, with paper, but,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> Who his foul tail with paper wipes,
 Shall at his ballocks leave some chips.
</pre>
 <p>
 What, said Grangousier, my little rogue, hast thou been at the pot, that
 thou dost rhyme already? Yes, yes, my lord the king, answered Gargantua, I
 can rhyme gallantly, and rhyme till I become hoarse with rheum. Hark, what
 our privy says to the skiters:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">Shittard,
Squirtard,
Crackard,
 Turdous,
Thy bung
Hath flung
Some dung
 On us:
Filthard,
Cackard,
Stinkard,
 St. Antony's fire seize on thy toane (bone?),
If thy
Dirty
Dounby
 Thou do not wipe, ere thou be gone.
</pre>
 <p>
 Will you have any more of it? Yes, yes, answered Grangousier. Then, said
 Gargantua,
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A Roundelay.
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve">In shitting yes'day I did know
The sess I to my arse did owe:
The smell was such came from that slunk,
That I was with it all bestunk:
O had but then some brave Signor
Brought her to me I waited for,
 In shitting!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">I would have cleft her watergap,
And join'd it close to my flipflap,
Whilst she had with her fingers guarded
My foul nockandrow, all bemerded
 In shitting.
</pre>
 <p>
 Now say that I can do nothing! By the Merdi, they are not of my making,
 but I heard them of this good old grandam, that you see here, and ever
 since have retained them in the budget of my memory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Let us return to our purpose, said Grangousier. What, said Gargantua, to
 skite? No, said Grangousier, but to wipe our tail. But, said Gargantua,
 will not you be content to pay a puncheon of Breton wine, if I do not
 blank and gravel you in this matter, and put you to a non-plus? Yes,
 truly, said Grangousier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There is no need of wiping one's tail, said Gargantua, but when it is
 foul; foul it cannot be, unless one have been a-skiting; skite then we
 must before we wipe our tails. O my pretty little waggish boy, said
 Grangousier, what an excellent wit thou hast? I will make thee very
 shortly proceed doctor in the jovial quirks of gay learning, and that, by
 G?, for thou hast more wit than age. Now, I prithee, go on in this
 torcheculative, or wipe-bummatory discourse, and by my beard I swear, for
 one puncheon, thou shalt have threescore pipes, I mean of the good Breton
 wine, not that which grows in Britain, but in the good country of Verron.
 Afterwards I wiped my bum, said Gargantua, with a kerchief, with a pillow,
 with a pantoufle, with a pouch, with a pannier, but that was a wicked and
 unpleasant torchecul; then with a hat. Of hats, note that some are shorn,
 and others shaggy, some velveted, others covered with taffeties, and
 others with satin. The best of all these is the shaggy hat, for it makes a
 very neat abstersion of the fecal matter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Afterwards I wiped my tail with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a
 calf's skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an
 attorney's bag, with a montero, with a coif, with a falconer's lure. But,
 to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps,
 bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipe-breeches, there is
 none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well downed,
 if you hold her head betwixt your legs. And believe me therein upon mine
 honour, for you will thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful
 pleasure, both in regard of the softness of the said down and of the
 temporate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut
 and the rest of the inwards, in so far as to come even to the regions of
 the heart and brains. And think not that the felicity of the heroes and
 demigods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their asphodel,
 ambrosia, or nectar, as our old women here used to say; but in this,
 according to my judgment, that they wipe their tails with the neck of a
 goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of
 Master John of Scotland, alias Scotus.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XIV.?How Gargantua was taught Latin by a Sophister.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The good man Grangousier having heard this discourse, was ravished with
 admiration, considering the high reach and marvellous understanding of his
 son Gargantua, and said to his governesses, Philip, king of Macedon, knew
 the great wit of his son Alexander by his skilful managing of a horse; for
 his horse Bucephalus was so fierce and unruly that none durst adventure to
 ride him, after that he had given to his riders such devilish falls,
 breaking the neck of this man, the other man's leg, braining one, and
 putting another out of his jawbone. This by Alexander being considered,
 one day in the hippodrome (which was a place appointed for the breaking
 and managing of great horses), he perceived that the fury of the horse
 proceeded merely from the fear he had of his own shadow, whereupon getting
 on his back, he run him against the sun, so that the shadow fell behind,
 and by that means tamed the horse and brought him to his hand. Whereby his
 father, knowing the divine judgment that was in him, caused him most
 carefully to be instructed by Aristotle, who at that time was highly
 renowned above all the philosophers of Greece. After the same manner I
 tell you, that by this only discourse, which now I have here had before
 you with my son Gargantua, I know that his understanding doth participate
 of some divinity, and that, if he be well taught, and have that education
 which is fitting, he will attain to a supreme degree of wisdom. Therefore
 will I commit him to some learned man, to have him indoctrinated according
 to his capacity, and will spare no cost. Presently they appointed him a
 great sophister-doctor, called Master Tubal Holofernes, who taught him his
 ABC so well, that he could say it by heart backwards; and about this he
 was five years and three months. Then read he to him Donat, Le Facet,
 Theodolet, and Alanus in parabolis. About this he was thirteen years, six
 months, and two weeks. But you must remark that in the mean time he did
 learn to write in Gothic characters, and that he wrote all his books?for
 the art of printing was not then in use?and did ordinarily carry a
 great pen and inkhorn, weighing about seven thousand quintals (that is,
 700,000 pound weight), the penner whereof was as big and as long as the
 great pillars of Enay, and the horn was hanging to it in great iron
 chains, it being of the wideness of a tun of merchant ware. After that he
 read unto him the book de modis significandi, with the commentaries of
 Hurtbise, of Fasquin, of Tropdieux, of Gualhaut, of John Calf, of
 Billonio, of Berlinguandus, and a rabble of others; and herein he spent
 more than eighteen years and eleven months, and was so well versed in it
 that, to try masteries in school disputes with his condisciples, he would
 recite it by heart backwards, and did sometimes prove on his finger-ends
 to his mother, quod de modis significandi non erat scientia. Then did he
 read to him the compost for knowing the age of the moon, the seasons of
 the year, and tides of the sea, on which he spent sixteen years and two
 months, and that justly at the time that his said preceptor died of the
 French pox, which was in the year one thousand four hundred and twenty.
 Afterwards he got an old coughing fellow to teach him, named Master
 Jobelin Bride, or muzzled dolt, who read unto him Hugutio, Hebrard('s)
 Grecism, the Doctrinal, the Parts, the Quid est, the Supplementum,
 Marmotretus, De moribus in mensa servandis, Seneca de quatuor virtutibus
 cardinalibus, Passavantus cum commento, and Dormi secure for the holidays,
 and some other of such like mealy stuff, by reading whereof he became as
 wise as any we ever since baked in an oven.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XV.?How Gargantua was put under other schoolmasters.
 </h2>
 <p>
 At the last his father perceived that indeed he studied hard, and that,
 although he spent all his time in it, he did nevertheless profit nothing,
 but which is worse, grew thereby foolish, simple, doted, and blockish,
 whereof making a heavy regret to Don Philip of Marays, Viceroy or Depute
 King of Papeligosse, he found that it were better for him to learn nothing
 at all, than to be taught such-like books, under such schoolmasters;
 because their knowledge was nothing but brutishness, and their wisdom but
 blunt foppish toys, serving only to bastardize good and noble spirits, and
 to corrupt all the flower of youth. That it is so, take, said he, any
 young boy of this time who hath only studied two years,?if he have
 not a better judgment, a better discourse, and that expressed in better
 terms than your son, with a completer carriage and civility to all manner
 of persons, account me for ever hereafter a very clounch and bacon-slicer
 of Brene. This pleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that it
 should be done. At night at supper, the said Des Marays brought in a young
 page of his, of Ville-gouges, called Eudemon, so neat, so trim, so
 handsome in his apparel, so spruce, with his hair in so good order, and so
 sweet and comely in his behaviour, that he had the resemblance of a little
 angel more than of a human creature. Then he said to Grangousier, Do you
 see this young boy? He is not as yet full twelve years old. Let us try, if
 it please you, what difference there is betwixt the knowledge of the
 doting Mateologians of old time and the young lads that are now. The trial
 pleased Grangousier, and he commanded the page to begin. Then Eudemon,
 asking leave of the vice-king his master so to do, with his cap in his
 hand, a clear and open countenance, beautiful and ruddy lips, his eyes
 steady, and his looks fixed upon Gargantua with a youthful modesty,
 standing up straight on his feet, began very gracefully to commend him;
 first, for his virtue and good manners; secondly, for his knowledge,
 thirdly, for his nobility; fourthly, for his bodily accomplishments; and,
 in the fifth place, most sweetly exhorted him to reverence his father with
 all due observancy, who was so careful to have him well brought up. In the
 end he prayed him, that he would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the
 least of his servants; for other favour at that time desired he none of
 heaven, but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable service. All
 this was by him delivered with such proper gestures, such distinct
 pronunciation, so pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine terms, and
 so good Latin, that he seemed rather a Gracchus, a Cicero, an Aemilius of
 the time past, than a youth of this age. But all the countenance that
 Gargantua kept was, that he fell to crying like a cow, and cast down his
 face, hiding it with his cap, nor could they possibly draw one word from
 him, no more than a fart from a dead ass. Whereat his father was so
 grievously vexed that he would have killed Master Jobelin, but the said
 Des Marays withheld him from it by fair persuasions, so that at length he
 pacified his wrath. Then Grangousier commanded he should be paid his
 wages, that they should whittle him up soundly, like a sophister, with
 good drink, and then give him leave to go to all the devils in hell. At
 least, said he, today shall it not cost his host much if by chance he
 should die as drunk as a Switzer. Master Jobelin being gone out of the
 house, Grangousier consulted with the Viceroy what schoolmaster they
 should choose for him, and it was betwixt them resolved that Ponocrates,
 the tutor of Eudemon, should have the charge, and that they should go
 altogether to Paris, to know what was the study of the young men of France
 at that time.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XVI.?How Gargantua was sent to Paris, and of the huge
 great mare that he rode on; how she destroyed the oxflies of the Beauce.
 </h2>
 <p>

 <p>
 In the same season Fayoles, the fourth King of Numidia, sent out of the
 country of Africa to Grangousier the most hideously great mare that ever
 was seen, and of the strangest form, for you know well enough how it is
 said that Africa always is productive of some new thing. She was as big as
 six elephants, and had her feet cloven into fingers, like Julius Caesar's
 horse, with slouch-hanging ears, like the goats in Languedoc, and a little
 horn on her buttock. She was of a burnt sorrel hue, with a little mixture
 of dapple-grey spots, but above all she had a horrible tail; for it was
 little more or less than every whit as great as the steeple-pillar of St.
 Mark beside Langes: and squared as that is, with tuffs and ennicroches or
 hair-plaits wrought within one another, no otherwise than as the beards
 are upon the ears of corn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If you wonder at this, wonder rather at the tails of the Scythian rams,
 which weighed above thirty pounds each; and of the Surian sheep, who need,
 if Tenaud say true, a little cart at their heels to bear up their tail, it
 is so long and heavy. You female lechers in the plain countries have no
 such tails. And she was brought by sea in three carricks and a brigantine
 unto the harbour of Olone in Thalmondois. When Grangousier saw her, Here
 is, said he, what is fit to carry my son to Paris. So now, in the name of
 God, all will be well. He will in times coming be a great scholar. If it
 were not, my masters, for the beasts, we should live like clerks. The next
 morning?after they had drunk, you must understand?they took
 their journey; Gargantua, his pedagogue Ponocrates, and his train, and
 with them Eudemon, the young page. And because the weather was fair and
 temperate, his father caused to be made for him a pair of dun boots,?Babin
 calls them buskins. Thus did they merrily pass their time in travelling on
 their high way, always making good cheer, and were very pleasant till they
 came a little above Orleans, in which place there was a forest of
 five-and-thirty leagues long, and seventeen in breadth, or thereabouts.
 This forest was most horribly fertile and copious in dorflies, hornets,
 and wasps, so that it was a very purgatory for the poor mares, asses, and
 horses. But Gargantua's mare did avenge herself handsomely of all the
 outrages therein committed upon beasts of her kind, and that by a trick
 whereof they had no suspicion. For as soon as ever they were entered into
 the said forest, and that the wasps had given the assault, she drew out
 and unsheathed her tail, and therewith skirmishing, did so sweep them that
 she overthrew all the wood alongst and athwart, here and there, this way
 and that way, longwise and sidewise, over and under, and felled everywhere
 the wood with as much ease as a mower doth the grass, in such sort that
 never since hath there been there neither wood nor dorflies: for all the
 country was thereby reduced to a plain champaign field. Which Gargantua
 took great pleasure to behold, and said to his company no more but this:
 Je trouve beau ce (I find this pretty); whereupon that country hath been
 ever since that time called Beauce. But all the breakfast the mare got
 that day was but a little yawning and gaping, in memory whereof the
 gentlemen of Beauce do as yet to this day break their fast with gaping,
 which they find to be very good, and do spit the better for it. At last
 they came to Paris, where Gargantua refreshed himself two or three days,
 making very merry with his folks, and inquiring what men of learning there
 were then in the city, and what wine they drunk there.

 Chapter 1.XVII.?How Gargantua paid his welcome to the Parisians, and
 how he took away the great bells of Our Lady's Church.
 </h2>
 <p>

 <!-- IMAGE END -->
 <p>
 Some few days after that they had refreshed themselves, he went to see the
 city, and was beheld of everybody there with great admiration; for the
 people of Paris are so sottish, so badot, so foolish and fond by nature,
 that a juggler, a carrier of indulgences, a sumpter-horse, or mule with
 cymbals or tinkling bells, a blind fiddler in the middle of a cross lane,
 shall draw a greater confluence of people together than an evangelical
 preacher. And they pressed so hard upon him that he was constrained to
 rest himself upon the towers of Our Lady's Church. At which place, seeing
 so many about him, he said with a loud voice, I believe that these
 buzzards will have me to pay them here my welcome hither, and my
 Proficiat. It is but good reason. I will now give them their wine, but it
 shall be only in sport. Then smiling, he untied his fair braguette, and
 drawing out his mentul into the open air, he so bitterly all-to-bepissed
 them, that he drowned two hundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and
 eighteen, besides the women and little children. Some, nevertheless, of
 the company escaped this piss-flood by mere speed of foot, who, when they
 were at the higher end of the university, sweating, coughing, spitting,
 and out of breath, they began to swear and curse, some in good hot
 earnest, and others in jest. Carimari, carimara: golynoly, golynolo. By my
 sweet Sanctess, we are washed in sport, a sport truly to laugh at;?in
 French, Par ris, for which that city hath been ever since called Paris;
 whose name formerly was Leucotia, as Strabo testifieth, lib. quarto, from
 the Greek word leukotes, whiteness,?because of the white thighs of
 the ladies of that place. And forasmuch as, at this imposition of a new
 name, all the people that were there swore everyone by the Sancts of his
 parish, the Parisians, which are patched up of all nations and all pieces
 of countries, are by nature both good jurors and good jurists, and
 somewhat overweening; whereupon Joanninus de Barrauco, libro de
 copiositate reverentiarum, thinks that they are called Parisians from the
 Greek word parresia, which signifies boldness and liberty in speech. This
 done, he considered the great bells, which were in the said towers, and
 made them sound very harmoniously. Which whilst he was doing, it came into
 his mind that they would serve very well for tingling tantans and ringing
 campanels to hang about his mare's neck when she should be sent back to
 his father, as he intended to do, loaded with Brie cheese and fresh
 herring. And indeed he forthwith carried them to his lodging. In the
 meanwhile there came a master beggar of the friars of St. Anthony to
 demand in his canting way the usual benevolence of some hoggish stuff,
 who, that he might be heard afar off, and to make the bacon he was in
 quest of shake in the very chimneys, made account to filch them away
 privily. Nevertheless, he left them behind very honestly, not for that
 they were too hot, but that they were somewhat too heavy for his carriage.
 This was not he of Bourg, for he was too good a friend of mine. All the
 city was risen up in sedition, they being, as you know, upon any slight
 occasion, so ready to uproars and insurrections, that foreign nations
 wonder at the patience of the kings of France, who do not by good justice
 restrain them from such tumultuous courses, seeing the manifold
 inconveniences which thence arise from day to day. Would to God I knew the
 shop wherein are forged these divisions and factious combinations, that I
 might bring them to light in the confraternities of my parish! Believe for
 a truth, that the place wherein the people gathered together, were thus
 sulphured, hopurymated, moiled, and bepissed, was called Nesle, where then
 was, but now is no more, the oracle of Leucotia. There was the case
 proposed, and the inconvenience showed of the transporting of the bells.
 After they had well ergoted pro and con, they concluded in baralipton,
 that they should send the oldest and most sufficient of the faculty unto
 Gargantua, to signify unto him the great and horrible prejudice they
 sustain by the want of those bells. And notwithstanding the good reasons
 given in by some of the university why this charge was fitter for an
 orator than a sophister, there was chosen for this purpose our Master
 Janotus de Bragmardo.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XVIII.?How Janotus de Bragmardo was sent to Gargantua to
 recover the great bells.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Master Janotus, with his hair cut round like a dish a la Caesarine, in his
 most antique accoutrement liripipionated with a graduate's hood, and
 having sufficiently antidoted his stomach with oven-marmalades, that is,
 bread and holy water of the cellar, transported himself to the lodging of
 Gargantua, driving before him three red-muzzled beadles, and dragging
 after him five or six artless masters, all thoroughly bedaggled with the
 mire of the streets. At their entry Ponocrates met them, who was afraid,
 seeing them so disguised, and thought they had been some masquers out of
 their wits, which moved him to inquire of one of the said artless masters
 of the company what this mummery meant. It was answered him, that they
 desired to have their bells restored to them. As soon as Ponocrates heard
 that, he ran in all haste to carry the news unto Gargantua, that he might
 be ready to answer them, and speedily resolve what was to be done.
 Gargantua being advertised hereof, called apart his schoolmaster
 Ponocrates, Philotimus, steward of his house, Gymnastes, his esquire, and
 Eudemon, and very summarily conferred with them, both of what he should do
 and what answer he should give. They were all of opinion that they should
 bring them unto the goblet-office, which is the buttery, and there make
 them drink like roysters and line their jackets soundly. And that this
 cougher might not be puffed up with vain-glory by thinking the bells were
 restored at his request, they sent, whilst he was chopining and plying the
 pot, for the mayor of the city, the rector of the faculty, and the vicar
 of the church, unto whom they resolved to deliver the bells before the
 sophister had propounded his commission. After that, in their hearing, he
 should pronounce his gallant oration, which was done; and they being come,
 the sophister was brought in full hall, and began as followeth, in
 coughing.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XIX.?The oration of Master Janotus de Bragmardo for
 recovery of the bells.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Hem, hem, gud-day, sirs, gud-day. Et vobis, my masters. It were but reason
 that you should restore to us our bells; for we have great need of them.
 Hem, hem, aihfuhash. We have oftentimes heretofore refused good money for
 them of those of London in Cahors, yea and those of Bourdeaux in Brie, who
 would have bought them for the substantific quality of the elementary
 complexion, which is intronificated in the terrestreity of their
 quidditative nature, to extraneize the blasting mists and whirlwinds upon
 our vines, indeed not ours, but these round about us. For if we lose the
 piot and liquor of the grape, we lose all, both sense and law. If you
 restore them unto us at my request, I shall gain by it six basketfuls of
 sausages and a fine pair of breeches, which will do my legs a great deal
 of good, or else they will not keep their promise to me. Ho by gob,
 Domine, a pair of breeches is good, et vir sapiens non abhorrebit eam. Ha,
 ha, a pair of breeches is not so easily got; I have experience of it
 myself. Consider, Domine, I have been these eighteen days in
 matagrabolizing this brave speech. Reddite quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari, et
 quae sunt Dei, Deo. Ibi jacet lepus. By my faith, Domine, if you will sup
 with me in cameris, by cox body, charitatis, nos faciemus bonum cherubin.
 Ego occiditunum porcum, et ego habet bonum vino: but of good wine we
 cannot make bad Latin. Well, de parte Dei date nobis bellas nostras. Hold,
 I give you in the name of the faculty a Sermones de Utino, that utinam you
 would give us our bells. Vultis etiam pardonos? Per diem vos habebitis, et
 nihil payabitis. O, sir, Domine, bellagivaminor nobis; verily, est bonum
 vobis. They are useful to everybody. If they fit your mare well, so do
 they do our faculty; quae comparata est jumentis insipientibus, et similis
 facta est eis, Psalmo nescio quo. Yet did I quote it in my note-book, et
 est unum bonum Achilles, a good defending argument. Hem, hem, hem,
 haikhash! For I prove unto you, that you should give me them. Ego sic
 argumentor. Omnis bella bellabilis in bellerio bellando, bellans,
 bellativo, bellare facit, bellabiliter bellantes. Parisius habet bellas.
 Ergo gluc, Ha, ha, ha. This is spoken to some purpose. It is in tertio
 primae, in Darii, or elsewhere. By my soul, I have seen the time that I
 could play the devil in arguing, but now I am much failed, and
 henceforward want nothing but a cup of good wine, a good bed, my back to
 the fire, my belly to the table, and a good deep dish. Hei, Domine, I
 beseech you, in nomine Patris, Filii, et Spiritus sancti, Amen, to restore

 qui vivit et regnat per omnia secula seculorum, Amen. Hem,

 Verum enim vero, quandoquidem, dubio procul. Edepol, quoniam, ita certe,
 medius fidius; a town without bells is like a blind man without a staff,
 an ass without a crupper, and a cow without cymbals. Therefore be assured,
 until you have restored them unto us, we will never leave crying after
 you, like a blind man that hath lost his staff, braying like an ass
 without a crupper, and making a noise like a cow without cymbals. A
 certain latinisator, dwelling near the hospital, said since, producing the
 authority of one Taponnus,?I lie, it was one Pontanus the secular
 poet, ?who wished those bells had been made of feathers, and the
 clapper of a foxtail, to the end they might have begot a chronicle in the
 bowels of his brain, when he was about the composing of his carminiformal
 lines. But nac petetin petetac, tic, torche lorgne, or rot kipipur kipipot
 put pantse malf, he was declared an heretic. We make them as of wax. And
 no more saith the deponent. Valete et plaudite. Calepinus recensui.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XX.?How the Sophister carried away his cloth, and how he
 had a suit in law against the other masters.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The sophister had no sooner ended, but Ponocrates and Eudemon burst out in
 a laughing so heartily, that they had almost split with it, and given up
 the ghost, in rendering their souls to God: even just as Crassus did,
 seeing a lubberly ass eat thistles; and as Philemon, who, for seeing an
 ass eat those figs which were provided for his own dinner, died with force
 of laughing. Together with them Master Janotus fell a-laughing too as fast
 as he could, in which mood of laughing they continued so long, that their
 eyes did water by the vehement concussion of the substance of the brain,
 by which these lachrymal humidities, being pressed out, glided through the
 optic nerves, and so to the full represented Democritus Heraclitizing and
 Heraclitus Democritizing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When they had done laughing, Gargantua consulted with the prime of his
 retinue what should be done. There Ponocrates was of opinion that they
 should make this fair orator drink again; and seeing he had showed them
 more pastime, and made them laugh more than a natural soul could have
 done, that they should give him ten baskets full of sausages, mentioned in
 his pleasant speech, with a pair of hose, three hundred great billets of
 logwood, five-and-twenty hogsheads of wine, a good large down-bed, and a
 deep capacious dish, which he said were necessary for his old age. All
 this was done as they did appoint: only Gargantua, doubting that they
 could not quickly find out breeches fit for his wearing, because he knew
 not what fashion would best become the said orator, whether the martingale
 fashion of breeches, wherein is a spunghole with a drawbridge for the more
 easy caguing: or the fashion of the mariners, for the greater solace and
 comfort of his kidneys: or that of the Switzers, which keeps warm the
 bedondaine or belly-tabret: or round breeches with straight cannions,
 having in the seat a piece like a cod's tail, for fear of over-heating his
 reins:?all which considered, he caused to be given him seven ells of
 white cloth for the linings. The wood was carried by the porters, the
 masters of arts carried the sausages and the dishes, and Master Janotus
 himself would carry the cloth. One of the said masters, called Jousse
 Bandouille, showed him that it was not seemly nor decent for one of his
 condition to do so, and that therefore he should deliver it to one of
 them. Ha, said Janotus, baudet, baudet, or blockhead, blockhead, thou dost
 not conclude in modo et figura. For lo, to this end serve the suppositions
 and parva logicalia. Pannus, pro quo supponit? Confuse, said Bandouille,
 et distributive. I do not ask thee, said Janotus, blockhead, quomodo
 supponit, but pro quo? It is, blockhead, pro tibiis meis, and therefore I
 will carry it, Egomet, sicut suppositum portat appositum. So did he carry
 it away very close and covertly, as Patelin the buffoon did his cloth. The
 best was, that when this cougher, in a full act or assembly held at the
 Mathurins, had with great confidence required his breeches and sausages,
 and that they were flatly denied him, because he had them of Gargantua,
 according to the informations thereupon made, he showed them that this was
 gratis, and out of his liberality, by which they were not in any sort quit
 of their promises. Notwithstanding this, it was answered him that he
 should be content with reason, without expectation of any other bribe
 there. Reason? said Janotus. We use none of it here. Unlucky traitors, you
 are not worth the hanging. The earth beareth not more arrant villains than
 you are. I know it well enough; halt not before the lame. I have practised
 wickedness with you. By God's rattle, I will inform the king of the
 enormous abuses that are forged here and carried underhand by you, and let
 me be a leper, if he do not burn you alive like sodomites, traitors,
 heretics and seducers, enemies to God and virtue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon these words they framed articles against him: he on the other side
 warned them to appear. In sum, the process was retained by the court, and
 is there as yet. Hereupon the magisters made a vow never to decrott
 themselves in rubbing off the dirt of either their shoes or clothes:
 Master Janotus with his adherents vowed never to blow or snuff their
 noses, until judgment were given by a definitive sentence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By these vows do they continue unto this time both dirty and snotty; for
 the court hath not garbled, sifted, and fully looked into all the pieces
 as yet. The judgment or decree shall be given out and pronounced at the
 next Greek kalends, that is, never. As you know that they do more than
 nature, and contrary to their own articles. The articles of Paris maintain
 that to God alone belongs infinity, and nature produceth nothing that is
 immortal; for she putteth an end and period to all things by her
 engendered, according to the saying, Omnia orta cadunt, &amp;c. But these
 thick mist-swallowers make the suits in law depending before them both
 infinite and immortal. In doing whereof, they have given occasion to, and
 verified the saying of Chilo the Lacedaemonian, consecrated to the oracle
 at Delphos, that misery is the inseparable companion of law-debates; and
 that pleaders are miserable; for sooner shall they attain to the end of
 their lives, than to the final decision of their pretended rights.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXI.?The study of Gargantua, according to the discipline
 of his schoolmasters the Sophisters.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The first day being thus spent, and the bells put up again in their own
 place, the citizens of Paris, in acknowledgment of this courtesy, offered
 to maintain and feed his mare as long as he pleased, which Gargantua took
 in good part, and they sent her to graze in the forest of Biere. I think
 she is not there now. This done, he with all his heart submitted his study
 to the discretion of Ponocrates; who for the beginning appointed that he
 should do as he was accustomed, to the end he might understand by what
 means, in so long time, his old masters had made him so sottish and
 ignorant. He disposed therefore of his time in such fashion, that
 ordinarily he did awake betwixt eight and nine o'clock, whether it was day
 or not, for so had his ancient governors ordained, alleging that which
 David saith, Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere. Then did he tumble and
 toss, wag his legs, and wallow in the bed some time, the better to stir up
 and rouse his vital spirits, and apparelled himself according to the
 season: but willingly he would wear a great long gown of thick frieze,
 furred with fox-skins. Afterwards he combed his head with an Almain comb,
 which is the four fingers and the thumb. For his preceptor said that to
 comb himself otherwise, to wash and make himself neat, was to lose time in
 this world. Then he dunged, pissed, spewed, belched, cracked, yawned,
 spitted, coughed, yexed, sneezed and snotted himself like an archdeacon,
 and, to suppress the dew and bad air, went to breakfast, having some good
 fried tripes, fair rashers on the coals, excellent gammons of bacon, store
 of fine minced meat, and a great deal of sippet brewis, made up of the fat
 of the beef-pot, laid upon bread, cheese, and chopped parsley strewed
 together. Ponocrates showed him that he ought not to eat so soon after
 rising out of his bed, unless he had performed some exercise beforehand.
 Gargantua answered, What! have not I sufficiently well exercised myself? I
 have wallowed and rolled myself six or seven turns in my bed before I
 rose. Is not that enough? Pope Alexander did so, by the advice of a Jew
 his physician, and lived till his dying day in despite of his enemies. My
 first masters have used me to it, saying that to breakfast made a good
 memory, and therefore they drank first. I am very well after it, and dine
 but the better. And Master Tubal, who was the first licenciate at Paris,
 told me that it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes: so
 doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon perpetual drinking
 in a ribble rabble, like ducks, but on drinking early in the morning; unde
 versus,
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> To rise betimes is no good hour,
 To drink betimes is better sure.
</pre>
 <p>
 After that he had thoroughly broke his fast, he went to church, and they
 carried to him, in a great basket, a huge impantoufled or thick-covered
 breviary, weighing, what in grease, clasps, parchment and cover, little
 more or less than eleven hundred and six pounds. There he heard
 six-and-twenty or thirty masses. This while, to the same place came his
 orison-mutterer impaletocked, or lapped up about the chin like a tufted
 whoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with store of the
 vine-tree-syrup. With him he mumbled all his kiriels and dunsical
 breborions, which he so curiously thumbed and fingered, that there fell
 not so much as one grain to the ground. As he went from the church, they
 brought him, upon a dray drawn with oxen, a confused heap of paternosters
 and aves of St. Claude, every one of them being of the bigness of a
 hat-block; and thus walking through the cloisters, galleries, or garden,
 he said more in turning them over than sixteen hermits would have done.
 Then did he study some paltry half-hour with his eyes fixed upon his book;
 but, as the comic saith, his mind was in the kitchen. Pissing then a full
 urinal, he sat down at table; and because he was naturally phlegmatic, he
 began his meal with some dozens of gammons, dried neat's tongues, hard
 roes of mullet, called botargos, andouilles or sausages, and such other
 forerunners of wine. In the meanwhile, four of his folks did cast into his
 mouth one after another continually mustard by whole shovelfuls.
 Immediately after that, he drank a horrible draught of white wine for the
 ease of his kidneys. When that was done, he ate according to the season
 meat agreeable to his appetite, and then left off eating when his belly
 began to strout, and was like to crack for fulness. As for his drinking,
 he had in that neither end nor rule. For he was wont to say, That the
 limits and bounds of drinking were, when the cork of the shoes of him that
 drinketh swelleth up half a foot high.

 Then blockishly mumbling with a set on countenance a piece of scurvy
 grace, he washed his hands in fresh wine, picked his teeth with the foot
 of a hog, and talked jovially with his attendants. Then the carpet being

 After he had thus well played, revelled, past and spent his time, it was
 thought fit to drink a little, and that was eleven glassfuls the man, and,
 immediately after making good cheer again, he would stretch himself upon a
 fair bench, or a good large bed, and there sleep two or three hours
 together, without thinking or speaking any hurt. After he was awakened he
 would shake his ears a little. In the mean time they brought him fresh
 wine. There he drank better than ever. Ponocrates showed him that it was
 an ill diet to drink so after sleeping. It is, answered Gargantua, the
 very life of the patriarchs and holy fathers; for naturally I sleep salt,
 and my sleep hath been to me in stead of so many gammons of bacon. Then
 began he to study a little, and out came the paternosters or rosary of
 beads, which the better and more formally to despatch, he got upon an old
 mule, which had served nine kings, and so mumbling with his mouth, nodding
 and doddling his head, would go see a coney ferreted or caught in a gin.
 At his return he went into the kitchen to know what roast meat was on the
 spit, and what otherwise was to be dressed for supper. And supped very
 well, upon my conscience, and commonly did invite some of his neighbours
 that were good drinkers, with whom carousing and drinking merrily, they
 told stories of all sorts from the old to the new. Amongst others he had
 for domestics the Lords of Fou, of Gourville, of Griniot, and of Marigny.
 After supper were brought in upon the place the fair wooden gospels and
 the books of the four kings, that is to say, many pairs of tables and
 cards?or the fair flush, one, two, three?or at all, to make
 short work; or else they went to see the wenches thereabouts, with little
 small banquets, intermixed with collations and rear-suppers. Then did he
 sleep, without unbridling, until eight o'clock in the next morning.

 Chapter 1.XXIII.?How Gargantua was instructed by Ponocrates, and in
 such sort disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the day.
 </h2>
 <p>

 <!-- IMAGE END -->
 <p>
 When Ponocrates knew Gargantua's vicious manner of living, he resolved to
 bring him up in another kind; but for a while he bore with him,
 considering that nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great
 violence. Therefore, to begin his work the better, he requested a learned
 physician of that time, called Master Theodorus, seriously to perpend, if
 it were possible, how to bring Gargantua into a better course. The said
 physician purged him canonically with Anticyrian hellebore, by which
 medicine he cleansed all the alteration and perverse habitude of his
 brain. By this means also Ponocrates made him forget all that he had
 learned under his ancient preceptors, as Timotheus did to his disciples,
 who had been instructed under other musicians. To do this the better, they
 brought him into the company of learned men, which were there, in whose
 imitation he had a great desire and affection to study otherwise, and to
 improve his parts. Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of
 studying, that he lost not any one hour in the day, but employed all his
 time in learning and honest knowledge. Gargantua awaked, then, about four
 o'clock in the morning. Whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read
 unto him some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a
 pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page
 born in Basche, named Anagnostes. According to the purpose and argument of
 that lesson, he oftentimes gave himself to worship, adore, pray, and send
 up his supplications to that good God, whose Word did show his majesty and
 marvellous judgment. Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion
 of his natural digestions. There his master repeated what had been read,
 expounding unto him the most obscure and difficult points. In returning,
 they considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed
 it the night before, and into what signs the sun was entering, as also the
 moon for that day. This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed,
 and perfumed, during which time they repeated to him the lessons of the
 day before. He himself said them by heart, and upon them would ground some
 practical cases concerning the estate of man, which he would prosecute
 sometimes two or three hours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was
 fully clothed. Then for three good hours he had a lecture read unto him.
 This done they went forth, still conferring of the substance of the
 lecture, either unto a field near the university called the Brack, or unto
 the meadows, where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and at the
 piletrigone (which is a play wherein we throw a triangular piece of iron
 at a ring, to pass it), most gallantly exercising their bodies, as
 formerly they had done their minds. All their play was but in liberty, for
 they left off when they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat
 over all their body, or were otherwise weary. Then were they very well
 wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see
 if dinner was ready. Whilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and
 eloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the lecture.
 In the meantime Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sat they down
 at table. At the beginning of the meal there was read some pleasant
 history of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glass
 of wine. Then, if they thought good, they continued reading, or began to
 discourse merrily together; speaking first of the virtue, propriety,
 efficacy, and nature of all that was served in at the table; of bread, of
 wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of
 their dressing. By means whereof he learned in a little time all the
 passages competent for this that were to be found in Pliny, Athenaeus,
 Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore,
 Aristotle, Aelian, and others. Whilst they talked of these things, many
 times, to be the more certain, they caused the very books to be brought to
 the table, and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the
 things above said, that in that time there was not a physician that knew
 half so much as he did. Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read in
 the morning, and, ending their repast with some conserve or marmalade of
 quinces, he picked his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers, washed his hands
 and eyes with fair fresh water, and gave thanks unto God in some fine
 cantiques, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence. This done,
 they brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks
 and new inventions, which were all grounded upon arithmetic. By this means
 he fell in love with that numerical science, and every day after dinner
 and supper he passed his time in it as pleasantly as he was wont to do at
 cards and dice; so that at last he understood so well both the theory and
 practical part thereof, that Tunstall the Englishman, who had written very
 largely of that purpose, confessed that verily in comparison of him he had
 no skill at all. And not only in that, but in the other mathematical
 sciences, as geometry, astronomy, music, &amp;c. For in waiting on the
 concoction and attending the digestion of his food, they made a thousand
 pretty instruments and geometrical figures, and did in some measure
 practise the astronomical canons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After this they recreated themselves with singing musically, in four or
 five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased
 them. In matter of musical instruments, he learned to play upon the lute,
 the virginals, the harp, the Almain flute with nine holes, the viol, and
 the sackbut. This hour thus spent, and digestion finished, he did purge
 his body of natural excrements, then betook himself to his principal study
 for three hours together, or more, as well to repeat his matutinal
 lectures as to proceed in the book wherein he was, as also to write
 handsomely, to draw and form the antique and Roman letters. This being
 done, they went out of their house, and with them a young gentleman of
 Touraine, named the Esquire Gymnast, who taught him the art of riding.
 Changing then his clothes, he rode a Naples courser, a Dutch roussin, a
 Spanish jennet, a barded or trapped steed, then a light fleet horse, unto
 whom he gave a hundred carieres, made him go the high saults, bounding in
 the air, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale, turn short
 in a ring both to the right and left hand. There he broke not his lance;
 for it is the greatest foolery in the world to say, I have broken ten
 lances at tilts or in fight. A carpenter can do even as much. But it is a
 glorious and praise-worthy action with one lance to break and overthrow
 ten enemies. Therefore, with a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeled
 lance would he usually force up a door, pierce a harness, beat down a
 tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirassier saddle, with the mail-coat
 and gauntlet. All this he did in complete arms from head to foot. As for
 the prancing flourishes and smacking popisms for the better cherishing of
 the horse, commonly used in riding, none did them better than he. The
 cavallerize of Ferrara was but as an ape compared to him. He was
 singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another without
 putting foot to ground, and these horses were called desultories. He could
 likewise from either side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback
 without stirrups, and rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for
 such things are useful in military engagements. Another day he exercised
 the battle-axe, which he so dexterously wielded, both in the nimble,
 strong, and smooth management of that weapon, and that in all the feats
 practicable by it, that he passed knight of arms in the field, and at all
 essays.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then tossed he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the
 backsword, with the Spanish tuck, the dagger, poniard, armed, unarmed,
 with a buckler, with a cloak, with a target. Then would he hunt the hart,
 the roebuck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, the hare, the
 pheasant, the partridge, and the bustard. He played at the balloon, and
 made it bound in the air, both with fist and foot. He wrestled, ran,
 jumped?not at three steps and a leap, called the hops, nor at
 clochepied, called the hare's leap, nor yet at the Almains; for, said
 Gymnast, these jumps are for the wars altogether unprofitable, and of no
 use?but at one leap he would skip over a ditch, spring over a hedge,
 mount six paces upon a wall, ramp and grapple after this fashion up
 against a window of the full height of a lance. He did swim in deep waters
 on his belly, on his back, sideways, with all his body, with his feet
 only, with one hand in the air, wherein he held a book, crossing thus the
 breadth of the river of Seine without wetting it, and dragged along his
 cloak with his teeth, as did Julius Caesar; then with the help of one hand
 he entered forcibly into a boat, from whence he cast himself again
 headlong into the water, sounded the depths, hollowed the rocks, and
 plunged into the pits and gulfs. Then turned he the boat about, governed
 it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream and against the stream,
 stopped it in his course, guided it with one hand, and with the other laid
 hard about him with a huge great oar, hoisted the sail, hied up along the
 mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, set the compass in
 order, tackled the bowlines, and steered the helm. Coming out of the
 water, he ran furiously up against a hill, and with the same alacrity and
 swiftness ran down again. He climbed up at trees like a cat, and leaped
 from the one to the other like a squirrel. He did pull down the great
 boughs and branches like another Milo; then with two sharp well-steeled
 daggers and two tried bodkins would he run up by the wall to the very top
 of a house like a rat; then suddenly came down from the top to the bottom,
 with such an even composition of members that by the fall he would catch
 no harm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practise the javelin,
 the boar-spear or partisan, and the halbert. He broke the strongest bows
 in drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crossbows of steel,
 took his aim by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and
 planted the cannon, shot at butt-marks, at the papgay from below upwards,
 or to a height from above downwards, or to a descent; then before him,
 sideways, and behind him, like the Parthians. They tied a cable-rope to
 the top of a high tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground he
 wrought himself with his hands to the very top; then upon the same track
 came down so sturdily and firm that you could not on a plain meadow have
 run with more assurance. They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees.
 There would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching
 at nothing, would go back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great
 swiftness that hardly could one overtake him with running; and then, to
 exercise his breast and lungs, he would shout like all the devils in hell.
 I heard him once call Eudemon from St. Victor's gate to Montmartre.
 Stentor had never such a voice at the siege of Troy. Then for the
 strengthening of his nerves or sinews they made him two great sows of
 lead, each of them weighing eight thousand and seven hundred quintals,
 which they called alteres. Those he took up from the ground, in each hand
 one, then lifted them up over his head, and held them so without stirring
 three quarters of an hour and more, which was an inimitable force. He
 fought at barriers with the stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when
 it came to the cope, he stood so sturdily on his feet that he abandoned
 himself unto the strongest, in case they could remove him from his place,
 as Milo was wont to do of old. In whose imitation, likewise, he held a
 pomegranate in his hand, to give it unto him that could take it from him.
 The time being thus bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, and
 refreshed with other clothes, he returned fair and softly; and passing
 through certain meadows, or other grassy places, beheld the trees and
 plants, comparing them with what is written of them in the books of the
 ancients, such as Theophrast, Dioscorides, Marinus, Pliny, Nicander,
 Macer, and Galen, and carried home to the house great handfuls of them,
 whereof a young page called Rizotomos had charge; together with little
 mattocks, pickaxes, grubbing-hooks, cabbies, pruning-knives, and other
 instruments requisite for herborizing. Being come to their lodging, whilst
 supper was making ready, they repeated certain passages of that which hath
 been read, and sat down to table. Here remark, that his dinner was sober
 and thrifty, for he did then eat only to prevent the gnawings of his
 stomach, but his supper was copious and large, for he took then as much as
 was fit to maintain and nourish him; which, indeed, is the true diet
 prescribed by the art of good and sound physic, although a rabble of
 loggerheaded physicians, nuzzeled in the brabbling shop of sophisters,
 counsel the contrary. During that repast was continued the lesson read at
 dinner as long as they thought good; the rest was spent in good discourse,
 learned and profitable. After that they had given thanks, he set himself
 to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious instruments, or otherwise passed
 his time at some pretty sports, made with cards or dice, or in practising
 the feats of legerdemain with cups and balls. There they stayed some
 nights in frolicking thus, and making themselves merry till it was time to
 go to bed; and on other nights they would go make visits unto learned men,
 or to such as had been travellers in strange and remote countries. When it
 was full night before they retired themselves, they went unto the most
 open place of the house to see the face of the sky, and there beheld the
 comets, if any were, as likewise the figures, situations, aspects,
 oppositions, and conjunctions of both the fixed stars and planets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then with his master did he briefly recapitulate, after the manner of the
 Pythagoreans, that which he had read, seen, learned, done, and understood
 in the whole course of that day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then prayed they unto God the Creator, in falling down before him, and
 strengthening their faith towards him, and glorifying him for his
 boundless bounty; and, giving thanks unto him for the time that was past,
 they recommended themselves to his divine clemency for the future. Which
 being done, they went to bed, and betook themselves to their repose and
 rest.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXIV.?How Gargantua spent his time in rainy weather.
 </h2>
 <p>
 If it happened that the weather were anything cloudy, foul, and rainy, all
 the forenoon was employed, as before specified, according to custom, with
 this difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted to correct
 the distempers of the air. But after dinner, instead of their wonted
 exercitations, they did abide within, and, by way of apotherapy (that is,
 a making the body healthful by exercise), did recreate themselves in
 bottling up of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood, and in threshing
 sheaves of corn at the barn. Then they studied the art of painting or
 carving; or brought into use the antique play of tables, as Leonicus hath
 written of it, and as our good friend Lascaris playeth at it. In playing
 they examined the passages of ancient authors wherein the said play is
 mentioned or any metaphor drawn from it. They went likewise to see the
 drawing of metals, or the casting of great ordnance; how the lapidaries
 did work; as also the goldsmiths and cutters of precious stones. Nor did
 they omit to visit the alchemists, money-coiners, upholsterers, weavers,
 velvet-workers, watchmakers, looking-glass framers, printers, organists,
 and other such kind of artificers, and, everywhere giving them somewhat to
 drink, did learn and consider the industry and invention of the trades.
 They went also to hear the public lectures, the solemn commencements, the
 repetitions, the acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle lawyers, and
 sermons of evangelical preachers. He went through the halls and places
 appointed for fencing, and there played against the masters themselves at
 all weapons, and showed them by experience that he knew as much in it as,
 yea, more than, they. And, instead of herborizing, they visited the shops
 of druggists, herbalists, and apothecaries, and diligently considered the
 fruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds, the grease and ointments of some
 foreign parts, as also how they did adulterate them. He went to see the
 jugglers, tumblers, mountebanks, and quacksalvers, and considered their
 cunning, their shifts, their somersaults and smooth tongue, especially of
 those of Chauny in Picardy, who are naturally great praters, and brave
 givers of fibs, in matter of green apes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At their return they did eat more soberly at supper than at other times,
 and meats more desiccative and extenuating; to the end that the
 intemperate moisture of the air, communicated to the body by a necessary
 confinitive, might by this means be corrected, and that they might not
 receive any prejudice for want of their ordinary bodily exercise. Thus was
 Gargantua governed, and kept on in this course of education, from day to
 day profiting, as you may understand such a young man of his age may, of a
 pregnant judgment, with good discipline well continued. Which, although at
 the beginning it seemed difficult, became a little after so sweet, so
 easy, and so delightful, that it seemed rather the recreation of a king
 than the study of a scholar. Nevertheless Ponocrates, to divert him from
 this vehement intension of the spirits, thought fit, once in a month, upon
 some fair and clear day, to go out of the city betimes in the morning,
 either towards Gentilly, or Boulogne, or to Montrouge, or Charanton
 bridge, or to Vanves, or St. Clou, and there spend all the day long in
 making the greatest cheer that could be devised, sporting, making merry,
 drinking healths, playing, singing, dancing, tumbling in some fair meadow,
 unnestling of sparrows, taking of quails, and fishing for frogs and crabs.
 But although that day was passed without books or lecture, yet was it not
 spent without profit; for in the said meadows they usually repeated
 certain pleasant verses of Virgil's agriculture, of Hesiod and of
 Politian's husbandry, would set a-broach some witty Latin epigrams, then
 immediately turned them into roundelays and songs for dancing in the
 French language. In their feasting they would sometimes separate the water
 from the wine that was therewith mixed, as Cato teacheth, De re rustica,
 and Pliny with an ivy cup would wash the wine in a basinful of water, then
 take it out again with a funnel as pure as ever. They made the water go
 from one glass to another, and contrived a thousand little automatory
 engines, that is to say, moving of themselves.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXV.?How there was great strife and debate raised betwixt
 the cake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gargantua's country, whereupon were
 waged great wars.
 </h2>
 <p>
 At that time, which was the season of vintage, in the beginning of
 harvest, when the country shepherds were set to keep the vines, and hinder
 the starlings from eating up the grapes, as some cake-bakers of Lerne
 happened to pass along in the broad highway, driving into the city ten or
 twelve horses loaded with cakes, the said shepherds courteously entreated
 them to give them some for their money, as the price then ruled in the
 market. For here it is to be remarked, that it is a celestial food to eat
 for breakfast hot fresh cakes with grapes, especially the frail clusters,
 the great red grapes, the muscadine, the verjuice grape, and the laskard,
 for those that are costive in their belly, because it will make them gush
 out, and squirt the length of a hunter's staff, like the very tap of a
 barrel; and oftentimes, thinking to let a squib, they did
 all-to-besquatter and conskite themselves, whereupon they are commonly
 called the vintage thinkers. The bun-sellers or cake-makers were in
 nothing inclinable to their request; but, which was worse, did injure them
 most outrageously, calling them prattling gabblers, lickorous gluttons,
 freckled bittors, mangy rascals, shite-a-bed scoundrels, drunken roysters,
 sly knaves, drowsy loiterers, slapsauce fellows, slabberdegullion
 druggels, lubberly louts, cozening foxes, ruffian rogues, paltry
 customers, sycophant-varlets, drawlatch hoydens, flouting milksops,
 jeering companions, staring clowns, forlorn snakes, ninny lobcocks, scurvy
 sneaksbies, fondling fops, base loons, saucy coxcombs, idle lusks,
 scoffing braggarts, noddy meacocks, blockish grutnols, doddipol-joltheads,
 jobbernol goosecaps, foolish loggerheads, flutch calf-lollies, grouthead
 gnat-snappers, lob-dotterels, gaping changelings, codshead loobies,
 woodcock slangams, ninny-hammer flycatchers, noddypeak simpletons, turdy
 gut, shitten shepherds, and other suchlike defamatory epithets; saying
 further, that it was not for them to eat of these dainty cakes, but might
 very well content themselves with the coarse unranged bread, or to eat of
 the great brown household loaf. To which provoking words, one amongst
 them, called Forgier, an honest fellow of his person and a notable
 springal, made answer very calmly thus: How long is it since you have got
 horns, that you are become so proud? Indeed formerly you were wont to give
 us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money? This
 is not the part of good neighbours, neither do we serve you thus when you
 come hither to buy our good corn, whereof you make your cakes and buns.
 Besides that, we would have given you to the bargain some of our grapes,
 but, by his zounds, you may chance to repent it, and possibly have need of
 us at another time, when we shall use you after the like manner, and
 therefore remember it. Then Marquet, a prime man in the confraternity of
 the cake-bakers, said unto him, Yea, sir, thou art pretty well crest-risen
 this morning, thou didst eat yesternight too much millet and bolymong.
 Come hither, sirrah, come hither, I will give thee some cakes. Whereupon
 Forgier, dreading no harm, in all simplicity went towards him, and drew a
 sixpence out of his leather satchel, thinking that Marquet would have sold
 him some of his cakes. But, instead of cakes, he gave him with his whip
 such a rude lash overthwart the legs, that the marks of the whipcord knots
 were apparent in them, then would have fled away; but Forgier cried out as
 loud as he could, O, murder, murder, help, help, help! and in the meantime
 threw a great cudgel after him, which he carried under his arm, wherewith
 he hit him in the coronal joint of his head, upon the crotaphic artery of
 the right side thereof, so forcibly, that Marquet fell down from his mare
 more like a dead than living man. Meanwhile the farmers and country
 swains, that were watching their walnuts near to that place, came running
 with their great poles and long staves, and laid such load on these
 cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh upon green rye. The other
 shepherds and shepherdesses, hearing the lamentable shout of Forgier, came
 with their slings and slackies following them, and throwing great stones
 at them, as thick as if it had been hail. At last they overtook them, and
 took from them about four or five dozen of their cakes. Nevertheless they
 paid for them the ordinary price, and gave them over and above one hundred
 eggs and three baskets full of mulberries. Then did the cake-bakers help
 to get up to his mare Marquet, who was most shrewdly wounded, and
 forthwith returned to Lerne, changing the resolution they had to go to
 Pareille, threatening very sharp and boisterously the cowherds, shepherds,
 and farmers of Seville and Sinays. This done, the shepherds and
 shepherdesses made merry with these cakes and fine grapes, and sported
 themselves together at the sound of the pretty small pipe, scoffing and
 laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day met with a
 mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning.
 Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fair great red
 medicinal grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was
 quickly cured.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXVI.?How the inhabitants of Lerne, by the commandment of
 Picrochole their king, assaulted the shepherds of Gargantua unexpectedly
 and on a sudden.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The cake-bakers, being returned to Lerne, went presently, before they did
 either eat or drink, to the Capitol, and there before their king, called
 Picrochole, the third of that name, made their complaint, showing their
 panniers broken, their caps all crumpled, their coats torn, their cakes
 taken away, but, above all, Marquet most enormously wounded, saying that
 all that mischief was done by the shepherds and herdsmen of Grangousier,
 near the broad highway beyond Seville. Picrochole incontinent grew angry
 and furious; and, without asking any further what, how, why, or wherefore,
 commanded the ban and arriere ban to be sounded throughout all his
 country, that all his vassals of what condition soever should, upon pain
 of the halter, come, in the best arms they could, unto the great place
 before the castle, at the hour of noon, and, the better to strengthen his
 design, he caused the drum to be beat about the town. Himself, whilst his
 dinner was making ready, went to see his artillery mounted upon the
 carriage, to display his colours, and set up the great royal standard, and
 loaded wains with store of ammunition both for the field and the belly,
 arms and victuals. At dinner he despatched his commissions, and by his
 express edict my Lord Shagrag was appointed to command the vanguard,
 wherein were numbered sixteen thousand and fourteen arquebusiers or
 firelocks, together with thirty thousand and eleven volunteer adventurers.
 The great Touquedillon, master of the horse, had the charge of the
 ordnance, wherein were reckoned nine hundred and fourteen brazen pieces,
 in cannons, double cannons, basilisks, serpentines, culverins, bombards or
 murderers, falcons, bases or passevolins, spirols, and other sorts of
 great guns. The rearguard was committed to the Duke of Scrapegood. In the
 main battle was the king and the princes of his kingdom. Thus being
 hastily furnished, before they would set forward, they sent three hundred
 light horsemen, under the conduct of Captain Swillwind, to discover the
 country, clear the avenues, and see whether there was any ambush laid for
 them. But, after they had made diligent search, they found all the land
 round about in peace and quiet, without any meeting or convention at all;
 which Picrochole understanding, commanded that everyone should march
 speedily under his colours. Then immediately in all disorder, without
 keeping either rank or file, they took the fields one amongst another,
 wasting, spoiling, destroying, and making havoc of all wherever they went,
 not sparing poor nor rich, privileged or unprivileged places, church nor
 laity, drove away oxen and cows, bulls, calves, heifers, wethers, ewes,
 lambs, goats, kids, hens, capons, chickens, geese, ganders, goslings,
 hogs, swine, pigs, and such like; beating down the walnuts, plucking the
 grapes, tearing the hedges, shaking the fruit-trees, and committing such
 incomparable abuses, that the like abomination was never heard of.
 Nevertheless, they met with none to resist them, for everyone submitted to
 their mercy, beseeching them that they might be dealt with courteously in
 regard that they had always carried themselves as became good and loving
 neighbours, and that they had never been guilty of any wrong or outrage
 done upon them, to be thus suddenly surprised, troubled, and disquieted,
 and that, if they would not desist, God would punish them very shortly. To
 which expostulations and remonstrances no other answer was made, but that
 they would teach them to eat cakes.

 Chapter 1.XXVII.?How a monk of Seville saved the close of the abbey
 from being ransacked by the enemy.
 </h2>
 <p>

 <p>
 So much they did, and so far they went pillaging and stealing, that at
 last they came to Seville, where they robbed both men and women, and took
 all they could catch: nothing was either too hot or too heavy for them.
 Although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses, they
 nevertheless entered everywhere, then plundered and carried away all that
 was within, and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a
 most wonderful case. For the curates, vicars, preachers, physicians,
 chirurgeons, and apothecaries, who went to visit, to dress, to cure, to
 heal, to preach unto and admonish those that were sick, were all dead of
 the infection, and these devilish robbers and murderers caught never any
 harm at all. Whence comes this to pass, my masters? I beseech you think
 upon it. The town being thus pillaged, they went unto the abbey with a
 horrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against
 them. Whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a pass or
 ford called the Gue de Vede, except seven companies of foot and two
 hundred lancers, who, staying there, broke down the walls of the close, to
 waste, spoil, and make havoc of all the vines and vintage within that
 place. The monks (poor devils) knew not in that extremity to which of all
 their sancts they should vow themselves. Nevertheless, at all adventures
 they rang the bells ad capitulum capitulantes. There it was decreed that
 they should make a fair procession, stuffed with good lectures, prayers,
 and litanies contra hostium insidias, and jolly responses pro pace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was then in the abbey a claustral monk, called Friar John of the
 funnels and gobbets, in French des entoumeures, young, gallant, frisk,
 lusty, nimble, quick, active, bold, adventurous, resolute, tall, lean,
 wide-mouthed, long-nosed, a fair despatcher of morning prayers, unbridler
 of masses, and runner over of vigils; and, to conclude summarily in a
 word, a right monk, if ever there was any, since the monking world monked
 a monkery: for the rest, a clerk even to the teeth in matter of breviary.
 This monk, hearing the noise that the enemy made within the enclosure of
 the vineyard, went out to see what they were doing; and perceiving that
 they were cutting and gathering the grapes, whereon was grounded the
 foundation of all their next year's wine, returned unto the choir of the
 church where the other monks were, all amazed and astonished like so many
 bell-melters. Whom when he heard sing, im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nene,
 tum, ne, num, num, ini, i mi, co, o, no, o, o, neno, ne, no, no, no, rum,
 nenum, num: It is well shit, well sung, said he. By the virtue of God, why
 do not you sing, Panniers, farewell, vintage is done? The devil snatch me,
 if they be not already within the middle of our close, and cut so well
 both vines and grapes, that, by Cod's body, there will not be found for
 these four years to come so much as a gleaning in it. By the belly of
 Sanct James, what shall we poor devils drink the while? Lord God! da mihi
 potum. Then said the prior of the convent: What should this drunken fellow
 do here? let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service.
 Nay, said the monk, the wine service, let us behave ourselves so that it
 be not troubled; for you yourself, my lord prior, love to drink of the
 best, and so doth every honest man. Never yet did a man of worth dislike
 good wine, it is a monastical apophthegm. But these responses that you
 chant here, by G?, are not in season. Wherefore is it, that our
 devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage,
 and long in the advent, and all the winter? The late friar, Massepelosse,
 of good memory, a true zealous man, or else I give myself to the devil, of
 our religion, told me, and I remember it well, how the reason was, that in
 this season we might press and make the wine, and in winter whiff it up.
 Hark you, my masters, you that love the wine, Cop's body, follow me; for
 Sanct Anthony burn me as freely as a faggot, if they get leave to taste
 one drop of the liquor that will not now come and fight for relief of the
 vine. Hog's belly, the goods of the church! Ha, no, no. What the devil,
 Sanct Thomas of England was well content to die for them; if I died in the
 same cause, should not I be a sanct likewise? Yes. Yet shall not I die
 there for all this, for it is I that must do it to others and send them
 a-packing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he spake this he threw off his great monk's habit, and laid hold upon
 the staff of the cross, which was made of the heart of a sorbapple-tree,
 it being of the length of a lance, round, of a full grip, and a little
 powdered with lilies called flower de luce, the workmanship whereof was
 almost all defaced and worn out. Thus went he out in a fair long-skirted
 jacket, putting his frock scarfwise athwart his breast, and in this
 equipage, with his staff, shaft or truncheon of the cross, laid on so
 lustily, brisk, and fiercely upon his enemies, who, without any order, or
 ensign, or trumpet, or drum, were busied in gathering the grapes of the
 vineyard. For the cornets, guidons, and ensign-bearers had laid down their
 standards, banners, and colours by the wall sides: the drummers had
 knocked out the heads of their drums on one end to fill them with grapes:
 the trumpeters were loaded with great bundles of bunches and huge knots of
 clusters: in sum, everyone of them was out of array, and all in disorder.
 He hurried, therefore, upon them so rudely, without crying gare or beware,
 that he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled them over like swine, striking
 athwart and alongst, and by one means or other laid so about him, after
 the old fashion of fencing, that to some he beat out their brains, to
 others he crushed their arms, battered their legs, and bethwacked their
 sides till their ribs cracked with it. To others again he unjointed the
 spondyles or knuckles of the neck, disfigured their chaps, gashed their
 faces, made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and so swinged and
 balammed them that they fell down before him like hay before a mower. To
 some others he spoiled the frame of their kidneys, marred their backs,
 broke their thigh-bones, pashed in their noses, poached out their eyes,
 cleft their mandibles, tore their jaws, dung in their teeth into their
 throat, shook asunder their omoplates or shoulder-blades, sphacelated
 their shins, mortified their shanks, inflamed their ankles, heaved off of
 the hinges their ishies, their sciatica or hip-gout, dislocated the joints
 of their knees, squattered into pieces the boughts or pestles of their
 thighs, and so thumped, mauled and belaboured them everywhere, that never
 was corn so thick and threefold threshed upon by ploughmen's flails as
 were the pitifully disjointed members of their mangled bodies under the
 merciless baton of the cross. If any offered to hide himself amongst the
 thickest of the vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge
 of his back, and dashed his reins like a dog. If any thought by flight to
 escape, he made his head to fly in pieces by the lamboidal commissure,
 which is a seam in the hinder part of the skull. If anyone did scramble up
 into a tree, thinking there to be safe, he rent up his perinee, and
 impaled him in at the fundament. If any of his old acquaintance happened
 to cry out, Ha, Friar John, my friend Friar John, quarter, quarter, I
 yield myself to you, to you I render myself! So thou shalt, said he, and
 must, whether thou wouldst or no, and withal render and yield up thy soul
 to all the devils in hell; then suddenly gave them dronos, that is, so
 many knocks, thumps, raps, dints, thwacks, and bangs, as sufficed to warn
 Pluto of their coming and despatch them a-going. If any was so rash and
 full of temerity as to resist him to his face, then was it he did show the
 strength of his muscles, for without more ado he did transpierce him, by
 running him in at the breast, through the mediastine and the heart.
 Others, again, he so quashed and bebumped, that, with a sound bounce under
 the hollow of their short ribs, he overturned their stomachs so that they
 died immediately. To some, with a smart souse on the epigaster, he would
 make their midriff swag, then, redoubling the blow, gave them such a
 homepush on the navel that he made their puddings to gush out. To others
 through their ballocks he pierced their bumgut, and left not bowel, tripe,
 nor entrail in their body that had not felt the impetuosity, fierceness,
 and fury of his violence. Believe, that it was the most horrible spectacle
 that ever one saw. Some cried unto Sanct Barbe, others to St. George. O
 the holy Lady Nytouch, said one, the good Sanctess; O our Lady of
 Succours, said another, help, help! Others cried, Our Lady of Cunaut, of
 Loretto, of Good Tidings, on the other side of the water St. Mary Over.
 Some vowed a pilgrimage to St. James, and others to the holy handkerchief
 at Chamberry, which three months after that burnt so well in the fire that
 they could not get one thread of it saved. Others sent up their vows to
 St. Cadouin, others to St. John d'Angely, and to St. Eutropius of Xaintes.
 Others again invoked St. Mesmes of Chinon, St. Martin of Candes, St.
 Clouaud of Sinays, the holy relics of Laurezay, with a thousand other
 jolly little sancts and santrels. Some died without speaking, others spoke
 without dying; some died in speaking, others spoke in dying. Others
 shouted as loud as they could Confession, Confession, Confiteor, Miserere,
 In manus! So great was the cry of the wounded, that the prior of the abbey
 with all his monks came forth, who, when they saw these poor wretches so
 slain amongst the vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them. But
 whilst the priests were busied in confessing them, the little monkies ran
 all to the place where Friar John was, and asked him wherein he would be
 pleased to require their assistance. To which he answered that they should
 cut the throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground. They
 presently, leaving their outer habits and cowls upon the rails, began to
 throttle and make an end of those whom he had already crushed. Can you
 tell with what instruments they did it? With fair gullies, which are
 little hulchbacked demi-knives, the iron tool whereof is two inches long,
 and the wooden handle one inch thick, and three inches in length,
 wherewith the little boys in our country cut ripe walnuts in two while
 they are yet in the shell, and pick out the kernel, and they found them
 very fit for the expediting of that weasand-slitting exploit. In the
 meantime Friar John, with his formidable baton of the cross, got to the
 breach which the enemies had made, and there stood to snatch up those that
 endeavoured to escape. Some of the monkitos carried the standards,
 banners, ensigns, guidons, and colours into their cells and chambers to
 make garters of them. But when those that had been shriven would have gone
 out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy monk quashed and felled them
 down with blows, saying, These men have had confession and are penitent
 souls; they have got their absolution and gained the pardons; they go into
 paradise as straight as a sickle, or as the way is to Faye (like
 Crooked-Lane at Eastcheap). Thus by his prowess and valour were
 discomfited all those of the army that entered into the close of the
 abbey, unto the number of thirteen thousand, six hundred, twenty and two,
 besides the women and little children, which is always to be understood.
 Never did Maugis the Hermit bear himself more valiantly with his bourdon
 or pilgrim's staff against the Saracens, of whom is written in the Acts of
 the four sons of Aymon, than did this monk against his enemies with the
 staff of the cross.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXVIII.?How Picrochole stormed and took by assault the
 rock Clermond, and of Grangousier's unwillingness and aversion from the
 undertaking of war.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Whilst the monk did thus skirmish, as we have said, against those which
 were entered within the close, Picrochole in great haste passed the ford
 of Vede?a very especial pass?with all his soldiers, and set
 upon the rock Clermond, where there was made him no resistance at all;
 and, because it was already night, he resolved to quarter himself and his
 army in that town, and to refresh himself of his pugnative choler. In the
 morning he stormed and took the bulwarks and castle, which afterwards he
 fortified with rampiers, and furnished with all ammunition requisite,
 intending to make his retreat there, if he should happen to be otherwise
 worsted; for it was a strong place, both by art and nature, in regard of
 the stance and situation of it. But let us leave them there, and return to
 our good Gargantua, who is at Paris very assiduous and earnest at the
 study of good letters and athletical exercitations, and to the good old
 man Grangousier his father, who after supper warmeth his ballocks by a
 good, clear, great fire, and, waiting upon the broiling of some chestnuts,
 is very serious in drawing scratches on the hearth, with a stick burnt at
 the one end, wherewith they did stir up the fire, telling to his wife and
 the rest of the family pleasant old stories and tales of former times.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst he was thus employed, one of the shepherds which did keep the
 vines, named Pillot, came towards him, and to the full related the
 enormous abuses which were committed, and the excessive spoil that was
 made by Picrochole, King of Lerne, upon his lands and territories, and how
 he had pillaged, wasted, and ransacked all the country, except the
 enclosure at Seville, which Friar John des Entoumeures to his great honour
 had preserved; and that at the same present time the said king was in the
 rock Clermond, and there, with great industry and circumspection, was
 strengthening himself and his whole army. Halas, halas, alas! said
 Grangousier, what is this, good people? Do I dream, or is it true that
 they tell me? Picrochole, my ancient friend of old time, of my own kindred
 and alliance, comes he to invade me? What moves him? What provokes him?
 What sets him on? What drives him to it? Who hath given him this counsel?
 Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, my God, my Saviour, help me, inspire me, and advise me
 what I shall do! I protest, I swear before thee, so be thou favourable to
 me, if ever I did him or his subjects any damage or displeasure, or
 committed any the least robbery in his country; but, on the contrary, I
 have succoured and supplied him with men, money, friendship, and counsel,
 upon any occasion wherein I could be steadable for the improvement of his
 good. That he hath therefore at this nick of time so outraged and wronged
 me, it cannot be but by the malevolent and wicked spirit. Good God, thou
 knowest my courage, for nothing can be hidden from thee. If perhaps he be
 grown mad, and that thou hast sent him hither to me for the better
 recovery and re-establishment of his brain, grant me power and wisdom to
 bring him to the yoke of thy holy will by good discipline. Ho, ho, ho, ho,
 my good people, my friends and my faithful servants, must I hinder you
 from helping me? Alas, my old age required hence-forward nothing else but
 rest, and all the days of my life I have laboured for nothing so much as
 peace; but now I must, I see it well, load with arms my poor, weary, and
 feeble shoulders, and take in my trembling hand the lance and horseman's
 mace, to succour and protect my honest subjects. Reason will have it so;
 for by their labour am I entertained, and with their sweat am I nourished,
 I, my children and my family. This notwithstanding, I will not undertake
 war, until I have first tried all the ways and means of peace: that I
 resolve upon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then assembled he his council, and proposed the matter as it was indeed.
 Whereupon it was concluded that they should send some discreet man unto
 Picrochole, to know wherefore he had thus suddenly broken the peace and
 invaded those lands unto which he had no right nor title. Furthermore,
 that they should send for Gargantua, and those under his command, for the
 preservation of the country, and defence thereof now at need. All this
 pleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that so it should be done.
 Presently therefore he sent the Basque his lackey to fetch Gargantua with
 all diligence, and wrote him as followeth.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXIX.?The tenour of the letter which Grangousier wrote to
 his son Gargantua.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The fervency of thy studies did require that I should not in a long time
 recall thee from that philosophical rest thou now enjoyest, if the
 confidence reposed in our friends and ancient confederates had not at this
 present disappointed the assurance of my old age. But seeing such is my
 fatal destiny, that I should be now disquieted by those in whom I trusted
 most, I am forced to call thee back to help the people and goods which by
 the right of nature belong unto thee. For even as arms are weak abroad, if
 there be not counsel at home, so is that study vain and counsel
 unprofitable which in a due and convenient time is not by virtue executed
 and put in effect. My deliberation is not to provoke, but to appease?not
 to assault, but to defend?not to conquer, but to preserve my
 faithful subjects and hereditary dominions, into which Picrochole is
 entered in a hostile manner without any ground or cause, and from day to
 day pursueth his furious enterprise with that height of insolence that is
 intolerable to freeborn spirits. I have endeavoured to moderate his
 tyrannical choler, offering him all that which I thought might give him
 satisfaction; and oftentimes have I sent lovingly unto him to understand
 wherein, by whom, and how he found himself to be wronged. But of him could
 I obtain no other answer but a mere defiance, and that in my lands he did
 pretend only to the right of a civil correspondency and good behaviour,
 whereby I knew that the eternal God hath left him to the disposure of his
 own free will and sensual appetite?which cannot choose but be
 wicked, if by divine grace it be not continually guided?and to
 contain him within his duty, and bring him to know himself, hath sent him
 hither to me by a grievous token. Therefore, my beloved son, as soon as
 thou canst, upon sight of these letters, repair hither with all diligence,
 to succour not me so much, which nevertheless by natural piety thou
 oughtest to do, as thine own people, which by reason thou mayest save and
 preserve. The exploit shall be done with as little effusion of blood as
 may be. And, if possible, by means far more expedient, such as military
 policy, devices, and stratagems of war, we shall save all the souls, and
 send them home as merry as crickets unto their own houses. My dearest son,
 the peace of Jesus Christ our Redeemer be with thee. Salute from me
 Ponocrates, Gymnastes, and Eudemon. The twentieth of September. Thy Father
 Grangousier.

 Chapter 1.XXX.?How Ulric Gallet was sent unto Picrochole.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The letters being dictated, signed, and sealed, Grangousier ordained that
 Ulric Gallet, master of the requests, a very wise and discreet man, of
 whose prudence and sound judgment he had made trial in several difficult
 and debateful matters, (should) go unto Picrochole, to show what had been
 decreed amongst them. At the same hour departed the good man Gallet, and
 having passed the ford, asked at the miller that dwelt there in what
 condition Picrochole was: who answered him that his soldiers had left him
 neither cock nor hen, that they were retired and shut up into the rock
 Clermond, and that he would not advise him to go any further for fear of
 the scouts, because they were enormously furious. Which he easily
 believed, and therefore lodged that night with the miller.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next morning he went with a trumpeter to the gate of the castle, and
 required the guards he might be admitted to speak with the king of
 somewhat that concerned him. These words being told unto the king, he
 would by no means consent that they should open the gate; but, getting
 upon the top of the bulwark, said unto the ambassador, What is the news,
 what have you to say? Then the ambassador began to speak as followeth.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXI.?The speech made by Gallet to Picrochole.
 </h2>
 <p>
 There cannot arise amongst men a juster cause of grief than when they
 receive hurt and damage where they may justly expect for favour and good
 will; and not without cause, though without reason, have many, after they
 had fallen into such a calamitous accident, esteemed this indignity less
 supportable than the loss of their own lives, in such sort that, if they
 have not been able by force of arms nor any other means, by reach of wit
 or subtlety, to stop them in their course and restrain their fury, they
 have fallen into desperation, and utterly deprived themselves of this
 light. It is therefore no wonder if King Grangousier, my master, be full
 of high displeasure and much disquieted in mind upon thy outrageous and
 hostile coming; but truly it would be a marvel if he were not sensible of
 and moved with the incomparable abuses and injuries perpetrated by thee
 and thine upon those of his country, towards whom there hath been no
 example of inhumanity omitted. Which in itself is to him so grievous, for
 the cordial affection wherewith he hath always cherished his subjects,
 that more it cannot be to any mortal man; yet in this, above human
 apprehension, is it to him the more grievous that these wrongs and sad
 offences have been committed by thee and thine, who, time out of mind,
 from all antiquity, thou and thy predecessors have been in a continual
 league and amity with him and all his ancestors; which, even until this
 time, you have as sacred together inviolably preserved, kept, and
 entertained, so well, that not he and his only, but the very barbarous
 nations of the Poictevins, Bretons, Manceaux, and those that dwell beyond
 the isles of the Canaries, and that of Isabella, have thought it as easy
 to pull down the firmament, and to set up the depths above the clouds, as
 to make a breach in your alliance; and have been so afraid of it in their
 enterprises that they have never dared to provoke, incense, or endamage
 the one for fear of the other. Nay, which is more, this sacred league hath
 so filled the world, that there are few nations at this day inhabiting
 throughout all the continent and isles of the ocean, who have not
 ambitiously aspired to be received into it, upon your own covenants and
 conditions, holding your joint confederacy in as high esteem as their own
 territories and dominions, in such sort, that from the memory of man there
 hath not been either prince or league so wild and proud that durst have
 offered to invade, I say not your countries, but not so much as those of
 your confederates. And if, by rash and heady counsel, they have attempted
 any new design against them, as soon as they heard the name and title of
 your alliance, they have suddenly desisted from their enterprises. What
 rage and madness, therefore, doth now incite thee, all old alliance
 infringed, all amity trod under foot, and all right violated, thus in a
 hostile manner to invade his country, without having been by him or his in
 anything prejudiced, wronged, or provoked? Where is faith? Where is law?
 Where is reason? Where is humanity? Where is the fear of God? Dost thou
 think that these atrocious abuses are hidden from the eternal spirit and
 the supreme God who is the just rewarder of all our undertakings? If thou
 so think, thou deceivest thyself; for all things shall come to pass as in
 his incomprehensible judgment he hath appointed. Is it thy fatal destiny,
 or influences of the stars, that would put an end to thy so long enjoyed
 ease and rest? For that all things have their end and period, so as that,
 when they are come to the superlative point of their greatest height, they
 are in a trice tumbled down again, as not being able to abide long in that
 state. This is the conclusion and end of those who cannot by reason and
 temperance moderate their fortunes and prosperities. But if it be
 predestinated that thy happiness and ease must now come to an end, must it
 needs be by wronging my king,?him by whom thou wert established? If
 thy house must come to ruin, should it therefore in its fall crush the
 heels of him that set it up? The matter is so unreasonable, and so
 dissonant from common sense, that hardly can it be conceived by human
 understanding, and altogether incredible unto strangers, till by the
 certain and undoubted effects thereof it be made apparent that nothing is
 either sacred or holy to those who, having emancipated themselves from God
 and reason, do merely follow the perverse affections of their own depraved
 nature. If any wrong had been done by us to thy subjects and dominions?if
 we had favoured thy ill-willers?if we had not assisted thee in thy
 need?if thy name and reputation had been wounded by us?or, to
 speak more truly, if the calumniating spirit, tempting to induce thee to
 evil, had, by false illusions and deceitful fantasies, put into thy
 conceit the impression of a thought that we had done unto thee anything
 unworthy of our ancient correspondence and friendship, thou oughtest first
 to have inquired out the truth, and afterwards by a seasonable warning to
 admonish us thereof; and we should have so satisfied thee, according to
 thine own heart's desire, that thou shouldst have had occasion to be
 contented. But, O eternal God, what is thy enterprise? Wouldst thou, like
 a perfidious tyrant, thus spoil and lay waste my master's kingdom? Hast
 thou found him so silly and blockish, that he would not?or so
 destitute of men and money, of counsel and skill in military discipline,
 that he cannot withstand thy unjust invasion? March hence presently, and
 to-morrow, some time of the day, retreat unto thine own country, without
 doing any kind of violence or disorderly act by the way; and pay withal a
 thousand besans of gold (which, in English money, amounteth to five
 thousand pounds), for reparation of the damages thou hast done in this
 country. Half thou shalt pay to-morrow, and the other half at the ides of
 May next coming, leaving with us in the mean time, for hostages, the Dukes
 of Turnbank, Lowbuttock, and Smalltrash, together with the Prince of
 Itches and Viscount of Snatchbit (Tournemoule, Bas-de-fesses, Menuail,
 Gratelles, Morpiaille.).

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXII.?How Grangousier, to buy peace, caused the cakes to
 be restored.
 </h2>
 <p>
 With that the good man Gallet held his peace, but Picrochole to all his
 discourse answered nothing but Come and fetch them, come and fetch them,
 ?they have ballocks fair and soft,?they will knead and provide
 some cakes for you. Then returned he to Grangousier, whom he found upon
 his knees bareheaded, crouching in a little corner of his cabinet, and
 humbly praying unto God that he would vouchsafe to assuage the choler of
 Picrochole, and bring him to the rule of reason without proceeding by
 force. When the good man came back, he asked him, Ha, my friend, what news
 do you bring me? There is neither hope nor remedy, said Gallet; the man is
 quite out of his wits, and forsaken of God. Yea, but, said Grangousier, my
 friend, what cause doth he pretend for his outrages? He did not show me
 any cause at all, said Gallet, only that in a great anger he spoke some
 words of cakes. I cannot tell if they have done any wrong to his
 cake-bakers. I will know, said Grangousier, the matter thoroughly, before
 I resolve any more upon what is to be done. Then sent he to learn
 concerning that business, and found by true information that his men had
 taken violently some cakes from Picrochole's people, and that Marquet's
 head was broken with a slacky or short cudgel; that, nevertheless, all was
 well paid, and that the said Marquet had first hurt Forgier with a stroke
 of his whip athwart the legs. And it seemed good to his whole council,
 that he should defend himself with all his might. Notwithstanding all
 this, said Grangousier, seeing the question is but about a few cakes, I
 will labour to content him; for I am very unwilling to wage war against
 him. He inquired then what quantity of cakes they had taken away, and
 understanding that it was but some four or five dozen, he commanded five
 cartloads of them to be baked that same night; and that there should be
 one full of cakes made with fine butter, fine yolks of eggs, fine saffron,
 and fine spice, to be bestowed upon Marquet, unto whom likewise he
 directed to be given seven hundred thousand and three Philips (that is, at
 three shillings the piece, one hundred five thousand pounds and nine
 shillings of English money), for reparation of his losses and hindrances,
 and for satisfaction of the chirurgeon that had dressed his wound; and
 furthermore settled upon him and his for ever in freehold the
 apple-orchard called La Pomardiere. For the conveyance and passing of all
 which was sent Gallet, who by the way as they went made them gather near
 the willow-trees great store of boughs, canes, and reeds, wherewith all
 the carriers were enjoined to garnish and deck their carts, and each of
 them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby to give
 all men to understand that they demanded but peace, and that they came to
 buy it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Being come to the gate, they required to speak with Picrochole from
 Grangousier. Picrochole would not so much as let them in, nor go to speak
 with them, but sent them word that he was busy, and that they should
 deliver their mind to Captain Touquedillon, who was then planting a piece
 of ordnance upon the wall. Then said the good man unto him, My lord, to
 ease you of all this labour, and to take away all excuses why you may not
 return unto our former alliance, we do here presently restore unto you the
 cakes upon which the quarrel arose. Five dozen did our people take away:
 they were well paid for: we love peace so well that we restore unto you
 five cartloads, of which this cart shall be for Marquet, who doth most
 complain. Besides, to content him entirely, here are seven hundred
 thousand and three Philips, which I deliver to him, and, for the losses he
 may pretend to have sustained, I resign for ever the farm of the
 Pomardiere, to be possessed in fee-simple by him and his for ever, without
 the payment of any duty, or acknowledgement of homage, fealty, fine, or
 service whatsoever, and here is the tenour of the deed. And, for God's
 sake, let us live henceforward in peace, and withdraw yourselves merrily
 into your own country from within this place, unto which you have no right
 at all, as yourselves must needs confess, and let us be good friends as
 before. Touquedillon related all this to Picrochole, and more and more
 exasperated his courage, saying to him, These clowns are afraid to some
 purpose. By G?, Grangousier conskites himself for fear, the poor
 drinker. He is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he any stomach for it. He
 knows better how to empty the flagons,?that is his art. I am of
 opinion that it is fit we send back the carts and the money, and, for the
 rest, that very speedily we fortify ourselves here, then prosecute our
 fortune. But what! Do they think to have to do with a ninnywhoop, to feed
 you thus with cakes? You may see what it is. The good usage and great
 familiarity which you have had with them heretofore hath made you
 contemptible in their eyes. Anoint a villain, he will prick you: prick a
 villain, and he will anoint you (Ungentem pungit, pungentem rusticus
 ungit.).
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sa, sa, sa, said Picrochole, by St. James you have given a true character
 of them. One thing I will advise you, said Touquedillon. We are here but
 badly victualled, and furnished with mouth-harness very slenderly. If
 Grangousier should come to besiege us, I would go presently, and pluck out
 of all your soldiers' heads and mine own all the teeth, except three to
 each of us, and with them alone we should make an end of our provision but
 too soon. We shall have, said Picrochole, but too much sustenance and
 feeding-stuff. Came we hither to eat or to fight? To fight, indeed, said
 Touquedillon; yet from the paunch comes the dance, and where famine rules
 force is exiled. Leave off your prating, said Picrochole, and forthwith
 seize upon what they have brought. Then took they money and cakes, oxen
 and carts, and sent them away without speaking one word, only that they
 would come no more so near, for a reason that they would give them the
 morrow after. Thus, without doing anything, returned they to Grangousier,
 and related the whole matter unto him, subjoining that there was no hope
 left to draw them to peace but by sharp and fierce wars.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXIII.?How some statesmen of Picrochole, by hairbrained
 counsel, put him in extreme danger.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The carts being unloaded, and the money and cakes secured, there came
 before Picrochole the Duke of Smalltrash, the Earl Swashbuckler, and
 Captain Dirt-tail (Menuail, Spadassin, Merdaille.), who said unto him,
 Sir, this day we make you the happiest, the most warlike and chivalrous
 prince that ever was since the death of Alexander of Macedonia. Be
 covered, be covered, said Picrochole. Gramercy, said they, we do but our
 duty. The manner is thus. You shall leave some captain here to have the
 charge of this garrison, with a party competent for keeping of the place,
 which, besides its natural strength, is made stronger by the rampiers and
 fortresses of your devising. Your army you are to divide into two parts,
 as you know very well how to do. One part thereof shall fall upon
 Grangousier and his forces. By it shall he be easily at the very first
 shock routed, and then shall you get money by heaps, for the clown hath
 store of ready coin. Clown we call him, because a noble and generous
 prince hath never a penny, and that to hoard up treasure is but a clownish
 trick. The other part of the army, in the meantime, shall draw towards
 Onys, Xaintonge, Angomois, and Gascony. Then march to Perigot, Medoc, and
 Elanes, taking wherever you come, without resistance, towns, castles, and
 forts; afterwards to Bayonne, St. John de Luc, to Fontarabia, where you
 shall seize upon all the ships, and coasting along Galicia and Portugal,
 shall pillage all the maritime places, even unto Lisbon, where you shall
 be supplied with all necessaries befitting a conqueror. By copsody, Spain
 will yield, for they are but a race of loobies. Then are you to pass by
 the Straits of Gibraltar, where you shall erect two pillars more stately
 than those of Hercules, to the perpetual memory of your name, and the
 narrow entrance there shall be called the Picrocholinal sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Having passed the Picrocholinal sea, behold, Barbarossa yields himself
 your slave. I will, said Picrochole, give him fair quarter and spare his
 life. Yea, said they, so that he be content to be christened. And you
 shall conquer the kingdoms of Tunis, of Hippo, Argier, Bomine (Bona),
 Corone, yea, all Barbary. Furthermore, you shall take into your hands
 Majorca, Minorca, Sardinia, Corsica, with the other islands of the
 Ligustic and Balearian seas. Going alongst on the left hand, you shall
 rule all Gallia Narbonensis, Provence, the Allobrogians, Genoa, Florence,
 Lucca, and then God b'w'ye, Rome. (Our poor Monsieur the Pope dies now for
 fear.) By my faith, said Picrochole, I will not then kiss his pantoufle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Italy being thus taken, behold Naples, Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily, all
 ransacked, and Malta too. I wish the pleasant Knights of the Rhodes
 heretofore would but come to resist you, that we might see their urine. I
 would, said Picrochole, very willingly go to Loretto. No, no, said they,
 that shall be at our return. From thence we will sail eastwards, and take
 Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and the Cyclade Islands, and set upon (the) Morea.
 It is ours, by St. Trenian. The Lord preserve Jerusalem; for the great
 Soldan is not comparable to you in power. I will then, said he, cause
 Solomon's temple to be built. No, said they, not yet, have a little
 patience, stay awhile, be never too sudden in your enterprises. Can you
 tell what Octavian Augustus said? Festina lente. It is requisite that you
 first have the Lesser Asia, Caria, Lycia, Pamphilia, Cilicia, Lydia,
 Phrygia, Mysia, Bithynia, Carazia, Satalia, Samagaria, Castamena, Luga,
 Savasta, even unto Euphrates. Shall we see, said Picrochole, Babylon and
 Mount Sinai? There is no need, said they, at this time. Have we not
 hurried up and down, travelled and toiled enough, in having transfretted
 and passed over the Hircanian sea, marched alongst the two Armenias and
 the three Arabias? Ay, by my faith, said he, we have played the fools, and
 are undone. Ha, poor souls! What's the matter? said they. What shall we
 have, said he, to drink in these deserts? For Julian Augustus with his
 whole army died there for thirst, as they say. We have already, said they,
 given order for that. In the Syriac sea you have nine thousand and
 fourteen great ships laden with the best wines in the world. They arrived
 at Port Joppa. There they found two-and-twenty thousand camels and sixteen
 hundred elephants, which you shall have taken at one hunting about
 Sigelmes, when you entered into Lybia; and, besides this, you had all the
 Mecca caravan. Did not they furnish you sufficiently with wine? Yes, but,
 said he, we did not drink it fresh. By the virtue, said they, not of a
 fish, a valiant man, a conqueror, who pretends and aspires to the monarchy
 of the world, cannot always have his ease. God be thanked that you and
 your men are come safe and sound unto the banks of the river Tigris. But,
 said he, what doth that part of our army in the meantime which overthrows
 that unworthy swillpot Grangousier? They are not idle, said they. We shall
 meet with them by-and-by. They shall have won you Brittany, Normandy,
 Flanders, Hainault, Brabant, Artois, Holland, Zealand; they have passed
 the Rhine over the bellies of the Switzers and lansquenets, and a party of
 these hath subdued Luxembourg, Lorraine, Champagne, and Savoy, even to
 Lyons, in which place they have met with your forces returning from the
 naval conquests of the Mediterranean sea; and have rallied again in
 Bohemia, after they had plundered and sacked Suevia, Wittemberg, Bavaria,
 Austria, Moravia, and Styria. Then they set fiercely together upon Lubeck,
 Norway, Swedeland, Rie, Denmark, Gitland, Greenland, the Sterlins, even
 unto the frozen sea. This done, they conquered the Isles of Orkney and
 subdued Scotland, England, and Ireland. From thence sailing through the
 sandy sea and by the Sarmates, they have vanquished and overcome Prussia,
 Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Wallachia, Transylvania, Hungary, Bulgaria,
 Turkeyland, and are now at Constantinople. Come, said Picrochole, let us
 go join with them quickly, for I will be Emperor of Trebizond also. Shall
 we not kill all these dogs, Turks and Mahometans? What a devil should we
 do else? said they. And you shall give their goods and lands to such as
 shall have served you honestly. Reason, said he, will have it so, that is
 but just. I give unto you the Caramania, Suria, and all the Palestine. Ha,
 sir, said they, it is out of your goodness; gramercy, we thank you. God
 grant you may always prosper. There was there present at that time an old
 gentleman well experienced in the wars, a stern soldier, and who had been
 in many great hazards, named Echephron, who, hearing this discourse, said,
 I do greatly doubt that all this enterprise will be like the tale or
 interlude of the pitcher full of milk wherewith a shoemaker made himself
 rich in conceit; but, when the pitcher was broken, he had not whereupon to
 dine. What do you pretend by these large conquests? What shall be the end
 of so many labours and crosses? Thus it shall be, said Picrochole, that
 when we are returned we shall sit down, rest, and be merry. But, said
 Echephron, if by chance you should never come back, for the voyage is long
 and dangerous, were it not better for us to take our rest now, than
 unnecessarily to expose ourselves to so many dangers? O, said
 Swashbuckler, by G?, here is a good dotard; come, let us go hide
 ourselves in the corner of a chimney, and there spend the whole time of
 our life amongst ladies, in threading of pearls, or spinning, like
 Sardanapalus. He that nothing ventures hath neither horse nor mule, says
 Solomon. He who adventureth too much, said Echephron, loseth both horse
 and mule, answered Malchon. Enough, said Picrochole, go forward. I fear
 nothing but that these devilish legions of Grangousier, whilst we are in
 Mesopotamia, will come on our backs and charge up our rear. What course
 shall we then take? What shall be our remedy? A very good one, said
 Dirt-tail; a pretty little commission, which you must send unto the
 Muscovites, shall bring you into the field in an instant four hundred and
 fifty thousand choice men of war. Oh that you would but make me your
 lieutenant-general, I should for the lightest faults of any inflict great
 punishments. I fret, I charge, I strike, I take, I kill, I slay, I play
 the devil. On, on, said Picrochole, make haste, my lads, and let him that
 loves me follow me.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXIV.?How Gargantua left the city of Paris to succour his
 country, and how Gymnast encountered with the enemy.
 </h2>
 <p>
 In this same very hour Gargantua, who was gone out of Paris as soon as he
 had read his father's letters, coming upon his great mare, had already
 passed the Nunnery-bridge, himself, Ponocrates, Gymnast, and Eudemon, who
 all three, the better to enable them to go along with him, took
 post-horses. The rest of his train came after him by even journeys at a
 slower pace, bringing with them all his books and philosophical
 instruments. As soon as he had alighted at Parille, he was informed by a
 farmer of Gouguet how Picrochole had fortified himself within the rock
 Clermond, and had sent Captain Tripet with a great army to set upon the
 wood of Vede and Vaugaudry, and that they had already plundered the whole
 country, not leaving cock nor hen, even as far as to the winepress of
 Billard. These strange and almost incredible news of the enormous abuses
 thus committed over all the land, so affrighted Gargantua that he knew not
 what to say nor do. But Ponocrates counselled him to go unto the Lord of
 Vauguyon, who at all times had been their friend and confederate, and that
 by him they should be better advised in their business. Which they did
 incontinently, and found him very willing and fully resolved to assist
 them, and therefore was of opinion that they should send some one of his
 company to scout along and discover the country, to learn in what
 condition and posture the enemy was, that they might take counsel, and
 proceed according to the present occasion. Gymnast offered himself to go.
 Whereupon it was concluded, that for his safety and the better expedition,
 he should have with him someone that knew the ways, avenues, turnings,
 windings, and rivers thereabout. Then away went he and Prelingot, the
 equerry or gentleman of Vauguyon's horse, who scouted and espied as
 narrowly as they could upon all quarters without any fear. In the meantime
 Gargantua took a little refreshment, ate somewhat himself, the like did
 those who were with him, and caused to give to his mare a picotine of
 oats, that is, three score and fourteen quarters and three bushels.
 Gymnast and his comrade rode so long, that at last they met with the
 enemy's forces, all scattered and out of order, plundering, stealing,
 robbing, and pillaging all they could lay their hands on. And, as far off
 as they could perceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one
 another in all haste towards him, to unload him of his money, and untruss
 his portmantles. Then cried he out unto them, My masters, I am a poor
 devil, I desire you to spare me. I have yet one crown left. Come, we must
 drink it, for it is aurum potabile, and this horse here shall be sold to
 pay my welcome. Afterwards take me for one of your own, for never yet was
 there any man that knew better how to take, lard, roast, and dress, yea,
 by G?, to tear asunder and devour a hen, than I that am here: and
 for my proficiat I drink to all good fellows. With that he unscrewed his
 borracho (which was a great Dutch leathern bottle), and without putting in
 his nose drank very honestly. The maroufle rogues looked upon him, opening
 their throats a foot wide, and putting out their tongues like greyhounds,
 in hopes to drink after him; but Captain Tripet, in the very nick of that
 their expectation, came running to him to see who it was. To him Gymnast
 offered his bottle, saying, Hold, captain, drink boldly and spare not; I
 have been thy taster, it is wine of La Faye Monjau. What! said Tripet,
 this fellow gibes and flouts us? Who art thou? said Tripet. I am, said
 Gymnast, a poor devil (pauvre diable). Ha, said Tripet, seeing thou art a
 poor devil, it is reason that thou shouldst be permitted to go
 whithersoever thou wilt, for all poor devils pass everywhere without toll
 or tax. But it is not the custom of poor devils to be so well mounted;
 therefore, sir devil, come down, and let me have your horse, and if he do
 not carry me well, you, master devil, must do it: for I love a life that
 such a devil as you should carry me away.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXV.?How Gymnast very souply and cunningly killed Captain
 Tripet and others of Picrochole's men.
 </h2>
 <p>
 When they heard these words, some amongst them began to be afraid, and
 blessed themselves with both hands, thinking indeed that he had been a
 devil disguised, insomuch that one of them, named Good John, captain of
 the trained bands of the country bumpkins, took his psalter out of his
 codpiece, and cried out aloud, Hagios ho theos. If thou be of God, speak;
 if thou be of the other spirit, avoid hence, and get thee going. Yet he
 went not away. Which words being heard by all the soldiers that were
 there, divers of them being a little inwardly terrified, departed from the
 place. All this did Gymnast very well remark and consider, and therefore
 making as if he would have alighted from off his horse, as he was poising
 himself on the mounting side, he most nimbly, with his short sword by his
 thigh, shifting his foot in the stirrup, performed the stirrup-leather
 feat, whereby, after the inclining of his body downwards, he forthwith
 launched himself aloft in the air, and placed both his feet together on
 the saddle, standing upright with his back turned towards the horse's
 head. Now, said he, my case goes backward. Then suddenly in the same very
 posture wherein he was, he fetched a gambol upon one foot, and, turning to
 the left hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just into its
 former stance, without missing one jot. Ha, said Tripet, I will not do
 that at this time, and not without cause. Well, said Gymnast, I have
 failed, I will undo this leap. Then with a marvellous strength and
 agility, turning towards the right hand, he fetched another frisking
 gambol as before, which done, he set his right-hand thumb upon the
 hind-bow of the saddle, raised himself up, and sprung in the air, poising
 and upholding his whole body upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb,
 and so turned and whirled himself about three times. At the fourth,
 reversing his body, and overturning it upside down, and foreside back,
 without touching anything, he brought himself betwixt the horse's two
 ears, springing with all his body into the air, upon the thumb of his left
 hand, and in that posture, turning like a windmill, did most actively do
 that trick which is called the miller's pass. After this, clapping his
 right hand flat upon the middle of the saddle, he gave himself such a
 jerking swing that he thereby seated himself upon the crupper, after the
 manner of gentlewomen sitting on horseback. This done, he easily passed
 his right leg over the saddle, and placed himself like one that rides in
 croup. But, said he, it were better for me to get into the saddle; then
 putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and
 thereupon leaning himself, as upon the only supporters of his body, he
 incontinently turned heels over head in the air, and straight found
 himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a good settlement. Then with a
 somersault springing into the air again, he fell to stand with both his
 feet close together upon the saddle, and there made above a hundred
 frisks, turns, and demipommads, with his arms held out across, and in so
 doing cried out aloud, I rage, I rage, devils, I am stark mad, devils, I
 am mad, hold me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whilst he was thus vaulting, the rogues in great astonishment said to one
 another, By cock's death, he is a goblin or a devil thus disguised. Ab
 hoste maligno libera nos, Domine, and ran away in a full flight, as if
 they had been routed, looking now and then behind them, like a dog that
 carrieth away a goose-wing in his mouth. Then Gymnast, spying his
 advantage, alighted from his horse, drew his sword, and laid on great
 blows upon the thickset and highest crested among them, and overthrew them
 in great heaps, hurt, wounded, and bruised, being resisted by nobody, they
 thinking he had been a starved devil, as well in regard of his wonderful
 feats in vaulting, which they had seen, as for the talk Tripet had with
 him, calling him poor devil. Only Tripet would have traitorously cleft his
 head with his horseman's sword, or lance-knight falchion; but he was well
 armed, and felt nothing of the blow but the weight of the stroke.
 Whereupon, turning suddenly about, he gave Tripet a home-thrust, and upon
 the back of that, whilst he was about to ward his head from a slash, he
 ran him in at the breast with a hit, which at once cut his stomach, the
 fifth gut called the colon, and the half of his liver, wherewith he fell
 to the ground, and in falling gushed forth above four pottles of pottage,
 and his soul mingled with the pottage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This done, Gymnast withdrew himself, very wisely considering that a case
 of great adventure and hazard should not be pursued unto its utmost
 period, and that it becomes all cavaliers modestly to use their good
 fortune, without troubling or stretching it too far. Wherefore, getting to
 horse, he gave him the spur, taking the right way unto Vauguyon, and
 Prelinguand with him.

 Chapter 1.XXXVI.?How Gargantua demolished the castle at the ford of
 Vede, and how they passed the ford.

 <p>
 As soon as he came, he related the estate and condition wherein they had
 found the enemy, and the stratagem which he alone had used against all
 their multitude, affirming that they were but rascally rogues, plunderers,
 thieves, and robbers, ignorant of all military discipline, and that they
 might boldly set forward unto the field; it being an easy matter to fell
 and strike them down like beasts. Then Gargantua mounted his great mare,
 accompanied as we have said before, and finding in his way a high and
 great tree, which commonly was called by the name of St. Martin's tree,
 because heretofore St. Martin planted a pilgrim's staff there, which in
 tract of time grew to that height and greatness, said, This is that which
 I lacked; this tree shall serve me both for a staff and lance. With that
 he pulled it up easily, plucked off the boughs, and trimmed it at his
 pleasure. In the meantime his mare pissed to ease her belly, but it was in
 such abundance that it did overflow the country seven leagues, and all the
 piss of that urinal flood ran glib away towards the ford of Vede,
 wherewith the water was so swollen that all the forces the enemy had there
 were with great horror drowned, except some who had taken the way on the
 left hand towards the hills. Gargantua, being come to the place of the
 wood of Vede, was informed by Eudemon that there was some remainder of the
 enemy within the castle, which to know, Gargantua cried out as loud as he
 was able, Are you there, or are you not there? If you be there, be there
 no more; and if you are not there, I have no more to say. But a ruffian
 gunner, whose charge was to attend the portcullis over the gate, let fly a
 cannon-ball at him, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right
 temple of his head, yet did him no more hurt than if he had but cast a
 prune or kernel of a wine-grape at him. What is this? said Gargantua; do
 you throw at us grape-kernels here? The vintage shall cost you dear;
 thinking indeed that the bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or
 raisin-kernel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Those who were within the castle, being till then busy at the pillage,
 when they heard this noise ran to the towers and fortresses, from whence
 they shot at him above nine thousand and five-and-twenty falconshot and
 arquebusades, aiming all at his head, and so thick did they shoot at him
 that he cried out, Ponocrates, my friend, these flies here are like to put
 out mine eyes; give me a branch of those willow-trees to drive them away,
 thinking that the bullets and stones shot out of the great ordnance had
 been but dunflies. Ponocrates looked and saw that there were no other
 flies but great shot which they had shot from the castle. Then was it that
 he rushed with his great tree against the castle, and with mighty blows
 overthrew both towers and fortresses, and laid all level with the ground,
 by which means all that were within were slain and broken in pieces. Going
 from thence, they came to the bridge at the mill, where they found all the
 ford covered with dead bodies, so thick that they had choked up the mill
 and stopped the current of its water, and these were those that were
 destroyed in the urinal deluge of the mare. There they were at a stand,
 consulting how they might pass without hindrance by these dead carcasses.
 But Gymnast said, If the devils have passed there, I will pass well
 enough. The devils have passed there, said Eudemon, to carry away the
 damned souls. By St. Treignan! said Ponocrates, then by necessary
 consequence he shall pass there. Yes, yes, said Gymnastes, or I shall
 stick in the way. Then setting spurs to his horse, he passed through
 freely, his horse not fearing nor being anything affrighted at the sight
 of the dead bodies; for he had accustomed him, according to the doctrine
 of Aelian, not to fear armour, nor the carcasses of dead men; and that not
 by killing men as Diomedes did the Thracians, or as Ulysses did in
 throwing the corpses of his enemies at his horse's feet, as Homer saith,
 but by putting a Jack-a-lent amongst his hay, and making him go over it
 ordinarily when he gave him his oats. The other three followed him very
 close, except Eudemon only, whose horse's fore-right or far forefoot sank
 up to the knee in the paunch of a great fat chuff who lay there upon his
 back drowned, and could not get it out. There was he pestered, until
 Gargantua, with the end of his staff, thrust down the rest of the
 villain's tripes into the water whilst the horse pulled out his foot; and,
 which is a wonderful thing in hippiatry, the said horse was thoroughly
 cured of a ringbone which he had in that foot by this touch of the burst
 guts of that great looby.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXVII.?How Gargantua, in combing his head, made the great
 cannon-balls fall out of his hair.
 </h2>
 <p>
 Being come out of the river of Vede, they came very shortly after to
 Grangousier's castle, who waited for them with great longing. At their
 coming they were entertained with many congees, and cherished with
 embraces. Never was seen a more joyful company, for Supplementum
 Supplementi Chronicorum saith that Gargamelle died there with joy; for my
 part, truly I cannot tell, neither do I care very much for her, nor for
 anybody else. The truth was, that Gargantua, in shifting his clothes, and
 combing his head with a comb, which was nine hundred foot long of the
 Jewish cane measure, and whereof the teeth were great tusks of elephants,
 whole and entire, he made fall at every rake above seven balls of bullets,
 at a dozen the ball, that stuck in his hair at the razing of the castle of
 the wood of Vede. Which his father Grangousier seeing, thought they had
 been lice, and said unto him, What, my dear son, hast thou brought us this
 far some short-winged hawks of the college of Montague? I did not mean
 that thou shouldst reside there. Then answered Ponocrates, My sovereign
 lord, think not that I have placed him in that lousy college which they
 call Montague; I had rather have put him amongst the grave-diggers of
 Sanct Innocent, so enormous is the cruelty and villainy that I have known
 there: for the galley-slaves are far better used amongst the Moors and
 Tartars, the murderers in the criminal dungeons, yea, the very dogs in
 your house, than are the poor wretched students in the aforesaid college.
 And if I were King of Paris, the devil take me if I would not set it on
 fire, and burn both principal and regents, for suffering this inhumanity
 to be exercised before their eyes. Then, taking up one of these bullets,
 he said, These are cannon-shot, which your son Gargantua hath lately
 received by the treachery of your enemies, as he was passing before the
 wood of Vede.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But they have been so rewarded, that they are all destroyed in the ruin of
 the castle, as were the Philistines by the policy of Samson, and those
 whom the tower of Silohim slew, as it is written in the thirteenth of
 Luke. My opinion is, that we pursue them whilst the luck is on our side;
 for occasion hath all her hair on her forehead; when she is passed, you
 may not recall her,?she hath no tuft whereby you can lay hold on
 her, for she is bald in the hind-part of her head, and never returneth
 again. Truly, said Grangousier, it shall not be at this time; for I will
 make you a feast this night, and bid you welcome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This said, they made ready supper, and, of extraordinary besides his daily
 fare, were roasted sixteen oxen, three heifers, two and thirty calves,
 three score and three fat kids, four score and fifteen wethers, three
 hundred farrow pigs or sheats soused in sweet wine or must, eleven score
 partridges, seven hundred snipes and woodcocks, four hundred Loudun and
 Cornwall capons, six thousand pullets, and as many pigeons, six hundred
 crammed hens, fourteen hundred leverets, or young hares and rabbits, three
 hundred and three buzzards, and one thousand and seven hundred cockerels.
 For venison, they could not so suddenly come by it, only eleven wild
 boars, which the Abbot of Turpenay sent, and eighteen fallow deer which
 the Lord of Gramount bestowed; together with seven score pheasants, which
 were sent by the Lord of Essars; and some dozens of queests, coushats,
 ringdoves, and woodculvers; river-fowl, teals and awteals, bitterns,
 courtes, plovers, francolins, briganders, tyrasons, young lapwings, tame
 ducks, shovellers, woodlanders, herons, moorhens, criels, storks,
 canepetiers, oranges, flamans, which are phaenicopters, or crimson-winged
 sea-fowls, terrigoles, turkeys, arbens, coots, solan-geese, curlews,
 termagants, and water-wagtails, with a great deal of cream, curds, and
 fresh cheese, and store of soup, pottages, and brewis with great variety.
 Without doubt there was meat enough, and it was handsomely dressed by
 Snapsauce, Hotchpot, and Brayverjuice, Grangousier's cooks. Jenkin
 Trudgeapace and Cleanglass were very careful to fill them drink.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXVIII.?How Gargantua did eat up six pilgrims in a salad.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The story requireth that we relate that which happened unto six pilgrims
 who came from Sebastian near to Nantes, and who for shelter that night,
 being afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the garden upon the
 chichling peas, among the cabbages and lettuces. Gargantua finding himself
 somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to make him a
 salad; and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the
 country, for they were as great as plum-trees or as walnut-trees, he would
 go thither himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good,
 and withal carried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear that
 they did not dare to speak nor cough.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Washing them, therefore, first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to
 another softly, What shall we do? We are almost drowned here amongst these
 lettuce, shall we speak? But if we speak, he will kill us for spies. And,
 as they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the
 lettuce into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the White
 Friars of the Cistercian order; which done, with oil, vinegar, and salt,
 he ate them up, to refresh himself a little before supper, and had already
 swallowed up five of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally
 hid under a lettuce, except his bourdon or staff that appeared, and
 nothing else. Which Grangousier seeing, said to Gargantua, I think that is
 the horn of a shell-snail, do not eat it. Why not? said Gargantua, they
 are good all this month: which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the
 staff, and therewith taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then
 drank a terrible draught of excellent white wine. The pilgrims, thus
 devoured, made shift to save themselves as well as they could, by
 withdrawing their bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth,
 but could not escape from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon
 of a prison. And when Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they thought to
 have been drowned in his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried
 them away into the gulf of his stomach. Nevertheless, skipping with their
 bourdons, as St. Michael's palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves
 from the danger of that inundation under the banks of his teeth. But one
 of them by chance, groping or sounding the country with his staff, to try
 whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a
 hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw, which put
 Gargantua to very great pain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he
 felt. To ease himself therefore of his smarting ache, he called for his
 toothpicker, and rubbing towards a young walnut-tree, where they lay
 skulking, unnestled you my gentlemen pilgrims.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, another by the
 pocket, another by the scarf, another by the band of the breeches, and the
 poor fellow that had hurt him with the bourdon, him he hooked to him by
 the codpiece, which snatch nevertheless did him a great deal of good, for
 it pierced unto him a pocky botch he had in the groin, which grievously
 tormented him ever since they were past Ancenis. The pilgrims, thus
 dislodged, ran away athwart the plain a pretty fast pace, and the pain
 ceased, even just at the time when by Eudemon he was called to supper, for
 all was ready. I will go then, said he, and piss away my misfortune; which
 he did do in such a copious measure, that the urine taking away the feet
 from the pilgrims, they were carried along with the stream unto the bank
 of a tuft of trees. Upon which, as soon as they had taken footing, and
 that for their self-preservation they had run a little out of the road,
 they on a sudden fell all six, except Fourniller, into a trap that had
 been made to take wolves by a train, out of which, nevertheless, they
 escaped by the industry of the said Fourniller, who broke all the snares
 and ropes. Being gone from thence, they lay all the rest of that night in
 a lodge near unto Coudray, where they were comforted in their miseries by
 the gracious words of one of their company, called Sweer-to-go, who showed
 them that this adventure had been foretold by the prophet David, Psalm.
 Quum exsurgerent homines in nos, forte vivos deglutissent nos; when we
 were eaten in the salad, with salt, oil, and vinegar. Quum irasceretur
 furor eorum in nos, forsitan aqua absorbuisset nos; when he drank the
 great draught. Torrentem pertransivit anima nostra; when the stream of his
 water carried us to the thicket. Forsitan pertransisset anima nostra aquam
 intolerabilem; that is, the water of his urine, the flood whereof, cutting
 our way, took our feet from us. Benedictus Dominus qui non dedit nos in
 captionem dentibus eorum. Anima nostra sicut passer erepta est de laqueo
 venantium; when we fell in the trap. Laqueus contritus est, by Fourniller,
 et nos liberati sumus. Adjutorium nostrum, &amp;c.

 <h2>
 Chapter 1.XXXIX.?How the Monk was feasted by Gargantua, and of the
 jovial discourse they had at supper.
 </h2>
 <p>
 When Gargantua was set down at table, after all of them had somewhat
 stayed their stomachs by a snatch or two of the first bits eaten heartily,
 Grangousier began to relate the source and cause of the war raised between
 him and Picrochole; and came to tell how Friar John of the Funnels had
 triumphed at the defence of the close of the abbey, and extolled him for
 his valour above Camillus, Scipio, Pompey, Caesar, and Themistocles. Then
 Gargantua desired that he might be presently sent for, to the end that
 with him they might consult of what was to be done. Whereupon, by a joint
 consent, his steward went for him, and brought him along merrily, with his
 staff of the cross, upon Grangousier's mule. When he was come, a thousand
 huggings, a thousand embracements, a thousand good days were given. Ha,
 Friar John, my friend Friar John, my brave cousin Friar John from the
 devil! Let me clip thee, my heart, about the neck; to me an armful. I must
 grip thee, my ballock, till thy back crack with it. Come, my cod, let me
 coll thee till I kill thee. And Friar John, the gladdest man in the world,
 never was man made welcomer, never was any more courteously and graciously
 received than Friar John. Come, come, said Gargantua, a stool here close
 by me at this end. I am content, said the monk, seeing you will have it
 so. Some water, page; fill, my boy, fill; it is to refresh my liver. Give
 me some, child, to gargle my throat withal. Deposita cappa, said Gymnast,
 let us pull off this frock. Ho, by G?, gentlemen, said the monk,
 there is a chapter in Statutis Ordinis which opposeth my laying of it
 down. Pish! said Gymnast, a fig for your chapter! This frock breaks both
 your shoulders, put it off. My friend, said the monk, let me alone with
 it; for, by G?, I'll drink the better that it is on. It makes all my
 body jocund. If I should lay it aside, the waggish pages would cut to
 themselves garters out of it, as I was once served at Coulaines. And,
 which is worse, I shall lose my appetite. But if in this habit I sit down
 at table, I will drink, by G?, both to thee and to thy horse, and so
 courage, frolic, God save the company! I have already supped, yet will I
 eat never a whit the less for that; for I have a paved stomach, as hollow
 as a butt of malvoisie or St. Benedictus' boot (butt), and always open
 like a lawyer's pouch. Of all fishes but the tench take the wing of a
 partridge or the thigh of a nun. Doth not he die like a good fellow that
 dies with a stiff catso? Our prior loves exceedingly the white of a capon.
 In that, said Gymnast, he doth not resemble the foxes; for of the capons,
 hens, and pullets which they carry away they never eat the white. Why?
 said the monk. Because, said Gymnast, they have no cooks to dress them;
 and, if they be not competently made ready, they remain red and not white;
 the redness of meats being a token that they have not got enough of the
 fire, whether by boiling, roasting, or otherwise, except the shrimps,
 lobsters, crabs, and crayfishes, which are cardinalized with boiling. By
 God's feast-gazers, said the monk, the porter of our abbey then hath not
 his head well boiled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an
 alder-tree. The thigh of this leveret is good for those that have the
 gout. To the purpose of the truel,?what is the reason that the
 thighs of a gentlewoman are always fresh and cool? This problem, said
 Gargantua, is neither in Aristotle, in Alexander Aphrodiseus, nor in
 Plutarch. There are three causes, said the monk, by which that place is
 naturally refreshed. Primo, because the water runs all along by it.
 Secundo, because it is a shady place, obscure and dark, upon which the sun
 never shines. And thirdly, because it is continually flabbelled, blown
 upon, and aired by the north winds of the hole arstick, the fan of the
 smock, and flipflap of the codpiece. And lusty, my lads. Some bousing
 liquor, page! So! crack, crack, crack. O how good is God, that gives us of
 this excellent juice! I call him to witness, if I had been in the time of
 Jesus Christ, I would have kept him from being taken by the Jews in the
 garden of Olivet. And the devil fail me, if I should have failed to cut
 off the hams of these gentlemen apostles who ran away so basely after they
 had well supped, and left their good master in the lurch. I hate that man
 worse than poison that offers to run away when he should fight and lay
 stoutly about him. Oh that I were but King of France for fourscore or a
 hundred years! By G?, I should whip like curtail-dogs these runaways
 of Pavia. A plague take them; why did they not choose rather to die there
 than to leave their good prince in that pinch and necessity? Is it not
 better and more honourable to perish in fighting valiantly than to live in
 disgrace by a cowardly running away? We are like to eat no great store of
 goslings this year; therefore, friend, reach me some of that roasted pig
 there.

 Diavolo, is there no more must? No more sweet wine? Germinavit radix
 Jesse. Je renie ma vie, je meurs de soif; I renounce my life, I rage for
 thirst. This wine is none of the worst. What wine drink you at Paris? I
 give myself to the devil, if I did not once keep open house at Paris for
 all comers six months together. Do you know Friar Claude of the high
 kilderkins? Oh the good fellow that he is! But I do not know what fly hath
 stung him of late, he is become so hard a student. For my part, I study
 not at all. In our abbey we never study for fear of the mumps, which
 disease in horses is called the mourning in the chine. Our late abbot was
 wont to say that it is a monstrous thing to see a learned monk. By G?,
 master, my friend, Magis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes.
 You never saw so many hares as there are this year. I could not anywhere
 come by a goshawk nor tassel of falcon. My Lord Belloniere promised me a
 lanner, but he wrote to me not long ago that he was become pursy. The
 partridges will so multiply henceforth, that they will go near to eat up
 our ears. I take no delight in the stalking-horse, for I catch such cold
 that I am like to founder myself at that sport. If I do not run, toil,
 travel, and trot about, I am not well at ease. True it is that in leaping
 over the hedges and bushes my frock leaves always some of its wool behind
 it. I have recovered a dainty greyhound; I give him to the devil, if he
 suffer a hare to escape him. A groom was leading him to my Lord
 Huntlittle, and I robbed him of him. Did I ill? No, Friar John, said
 Gymnast, no, by all the devils that are, no! So, said the monk, do I
 attest these same devils so long as they last, or rather, virtue (of) G?,
 what could that gouty limpard have done with so fine a dog? By the body of
 G?, he is better pleased when one presents him with a good yoke of
 oxen. How now,
