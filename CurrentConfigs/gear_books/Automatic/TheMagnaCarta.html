That we wish this so to be observed, appearsfrom the fact that of our own free will, before the outbreak of thepresent dispute between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed bycharter the freedom of the Church's elections - a right reckoned to beof the greatest necessity and importance to it - and caused this to beconfirmed by Pope Innocent III. This freedom we shall observe ourselves,and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.</p><p id="id00019">TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted, for us and ourheirs for ever, all the liberties written out below, to have and tokeep for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs:</p><p id="id00020">(2) If any earl, baron, or other person that holds lands directly ofthe Crown, for military service, shall die, and at his death his heirshall be of full age and owe a `relief', the heir shall have hisinheritance on payment of the ancient scale of `relief'. That is tosay, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay 100 for the entire earl'sbarony, the heir or heirs of a knight l00s. at most for the entireknight's `fee', and any man that owes less shall pay less, inaccordance with the ancient usage of `fees'</p><p id="id00021">(3) But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward, when hecomes of age he shall have his inheritance without `relief' or fine.</p><p id="id00022">(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall takefrom it only reasonable revenues, customary dues, and feudal services.He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property. Ifwe have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff, or to anyperson answerable to us for the revenues, and he commits destructionor damage, we will exact compensation from him, and the land shall beentrusted to two worthy and prudent men of the same `fee', who shallbe answerable to us for the revenues, or to the person to whom we haveassigned them. If we have given or sold to anyone the guardianship ofsuch land, and he causes destruction or damage, he shall lose theguardianship of it, and it shall be handed over to two worthy andprudent men of the same `fee', who shall be similarly answerable tous.</p><p id="id00023">(5) For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land, he shallmaintain the houses, parks, fish preserves, ponds, mills, andeverything else pertaining to it, from the revenues of the landitself. When the heir comes of age, he shall restore the whole land tohim, stocked with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as theseason demands and the revenues from the land can reasonably bear.</p><p id="id00024">(6) Heirs may be given in marriage, but not to someone of lower socialstanding. Before a marriage takes place, it shall be' made known tothe heir's next-of-kin.</p><p id="id00025">(7) At her husband's death, a widow may have her marriage portion andinheritance at once and without trouble. She shall pay nothing for herdower, marriage portion, or any inheritance that she and her husbandheld jointly on the day of his death. She may remain in her husband'shouse for forty days after his death, and within this period her dowershall be assigned to her.</p><p id="id00026">(8) No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she wishes toremain without a husband. But she must give security that she will notmarry without royal consent, if she holds her lands of the Crown, orwithout the consent of whatever other lord she may hold them of.</p><p id="id00027">(9) Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent inpayment of a debt, so long as the debtor has movable goods sufficientto discharge the debt. A debtor's sureties shall not be distrainedupon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt. If, forlack of means, the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, hissureties shall be answerable for it. If they so desire, they may havethe debtor's lands and rents until they have received satisfaction forthe debt that they paid for him, unless the debtor can show that hehas settled his obligations to them.</p><p id="id00028">(10) If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies beforethe debt has been repaid, his heir shall pay no interest on the debtfor so long as he remains under age, irrespective of whom he holds hislands. If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown, it will takenothing except the principal sum specified in the bond.</p><p id="id00029">(11) If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dowerand pay nothing towards the debt from it. If he leaves children thatare under age, their needs may also be provided for on a scaleappropriate to the size of his holding of lands. The debt is to bepaid out of the residue, reserving the service due to his feudal lords.Debts owed to persons other than Jews are to be dealt with similarly.</p><p id="id00030">(12) No `scutage' or `aid' may be levied in our kingdom without itsgeneral consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to makeour eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. Forthese purposes only a reasonable `aid' may be levied. `Aids' from thecity of London are to be treated similarly.</p><p id="id00031">(13) The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties andfree customs, both by land and by water. We also will and grant thatall other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall enjoy all theirliberties and free customs.</p><p id="id00032"> (14) To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessmentof an `aid' - except in the three cases specified above - or a`scutage', we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, andgreater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those whohold lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to beissued, through the sheriffs and other officials, to come together ona fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be given) andat a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summonswill be stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointedfor the day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution ofthose present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared.</p><p id="id00033">(15) In future we will allow no one to levy an `aid' from his freemen, except to ransom his person, to make his eldest son a knight, and(once) to marry his eldest daughter. For these purposes only areasonable `aid' may be levied.</p><p id="id00034">(16) No man shall be forced to perform more service for a knight's`fee', or other free holding of land, than is due from it.</p><p id="id00035">(17) Ordinary lawsuits shall not follow the royal court around, butshall be held in a fixed place.</p><p id="id00036">(18) Inquests of novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor, and darreinpresentment shall be taken only in their proper county court. Weourselves, or in our absence abroad our chief justice, will send twojustices to each county four times a year, and these justices, withfour knights of the county elected by the county itself, shall holdthe assizes in the county court, on the day and in the place where thecourt meets.</p><p id="id00037">(19) If any assizes cannot be taken on the day of the county court, asmany knights and freeholders shall afterwards remain behind, of thosewho have attended the court, as will suffice for the administration ofjustice, having regard to the volume of business to be done.</p><p id="id00038">(20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only inproportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offencecorrespondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of hislivelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared hismerchandise, and a husbandman the implements of his husbandry, if theyfall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall beimposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of theneighbourhood.</p><p id="id00039">(21) Earls and barons shall be fined only by their equals, and inproportion to the gravity of their offence.</p><p id="id00040">(22) A fine imposed upon the lay property of a clerk in holy ordersshall be assessed upon the same principles, without reference to thevalue of his ecclesiastical benefice.</p><p id="id00041">(23) No town or person shall be forced to build bridges over riversexcept those with an ancient obligation to do so.</p><p id="id00042">(24) No sheriff, constable, coroners, or other royal officials are tohold lawsuits that should be held by the royal justices.</p><p id="id00043">(25) Every county, hundred, wapentake, and tithing shall remain atits ancient rent, without increase, except the royal demesne manors.</p><p id="id00044">(26) If at the death of a man who holds a lay `fee' of the Crown, asheriff or royal official produces royal letters patent of summons fora debt due to the Crown, it shall be lawful for them to seize and listmovable goods found in the lay `fee' of the dead man to the value ofthe debt, as assessed by worthy men. Nothing shall be removed untilthe whole debt is paid, when the residue shall be given over to theexecutors to carry out the dead man's will. If no debt is due to theCrown, all the movable goods shall be regarded as the property of thedead man, except the reasonable shares of his wife and children.</p><p id="id00045">(27) If a free man dies intestate, his movable goods are to bedistributed by his next-of-kin and friends, under the supervision ofthe Church. The rights of his debtors are to be preserved.</p><p id="id00046">(28) No constable or other royal official shall take corn or othermovable goods from any man without immediate payment, unless theseller voluntarily offers postponement of this.</p><p id="id00047">(29) No constable may compel a knight to pay money for castle-guard ifthe knight is willing to undertake the guard in person, or withreasonable excuse to supply some other fit man to do it. A knighttaken or sent on military service shall be excused from castle-guardfor the period of this service.</p><p id="id00048">(30) No sheriff, royal official, or other person shall take horses orcarts for transport from any free man, without his consent.</p><p id="id00049">(31) Neither we nor any royal official will take wood for our castle,or for any other purpose, without the consent of the owner.</p><p id="id00050">(32) We will not keep the lands of people convicted of felony in ourhand for longer than a year and a day, after which they shall bereturned to the lords of the `fees' concerned.(33) All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, andthroughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast.</p><p id="id00051">(34) The writ called precipe shall not in future be issued to anyonein respect of any holding of land, if a free man could thereby bedeprived of the right of trial in his own lord's court.</p><p id="id00052">(35) There shall be standard measures of wine, ale, and corn (theLondon quarter), throughout the kingdom. There shall also be astandard width of dyed cloth, russett, and haberject, namely two ellswithin the selvedges. Weights are to be standardised similarly.</p><p id="id00053">(36) In future nothing shall be paid or accepted for the issue of awrit of inquisition of life or limbs. It shall be given gratis, andnot refused.</p><p id="id00054">(37) If a man holds land of the Crown by `fee-farm', `socage', or`burgage', and also holds land of someone else for knight's service,we will not have guardianship of his heir, nor of the land thatbelongs to the other person's `fee', by virtue of the `fee-farm',`socage', or `burgage', unless the `fee-farm' owes knight's service.We will not have the guardianship of a man's heir, or of land that heholds of someone else, by reason of any small property that he mayhold of the Crown for a service of knives, arrows, or the like.</p><p id="id00055">(38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his ownunsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to thetruth of it.</p><p id="id00056">(39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of hisrights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of hisstanding in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him,or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equalsor by the law of the land.</p><p id="id00057">(40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.</p><p id="id00058">(41) All merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and withoutfear, and may stay or travel within it, by land or water, for purposesof trade, free from all illegal exactions, in accordance with ancientand lawful customs. This, however, does not apply in time of war tomerchants from a country that is at war with us. Any such merchantsfound in our country at the outbreak of war shall be detained withoutinjury to their persons or property, until we or our chief justicehave discovered how our own merchants are being treated in the countryat war with us. If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.</p><p id="id00059">(42) In future it shall be lawful for any man to leave and return toour kingdom unharmed and without fear, by land or water, preservinghis allegiance to us, except in time of war, for some short period,for the common benefit of the realm. People that have been imprisonedor outlawed in accordance with the law of the land, people from acountry that is at war with us, and merchants - who shall be dealtwith as stated above - are excepted from this provision.(43) If a man holds lands of any `escheat' such as the `honour' ofWallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other `escheats'in our hand that are baronies, at his death his heir shall give usonly the `relief' and service that he would have made to the baron,had the barony been in the baron's hand. We will hold the `escheat' inthe same manner as the baron held it.</p><p id="id00060">(44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appearbefore the royal justices of the forest in answer to generalsummonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings or aresureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.</p><p id="id00061">(45) We will appoint as justices, constables, sheriffs, or otherofficials, only men that know the law of the realm and are minded tokeep it well.</p><p id="id00062">(46) All barons who have founded abbeys, and have charters of Englishkings or ancient tenure as evidence of this, may have guardianship ofthem when there is no abbot, as is their due.</p><p id="id00063">(47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once bedisafforested. River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shallbe treated similarly.</p><p id="id00064">(48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters,warreners, sheriffs and their servants, or river-banks and theirwardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by twelvesworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquirythe evil customs are to be abolished completely and irrevocably. Butwe, or our chief justice if we are not in England, are first to beinformed.</p><p id="id00065">(49) We will at once return all hostages and charters delivered upto us by Englishmen as security for peace or for loyal service.***here were some strange characters, not completely removed(50) We will remove completely from their offices the kinsmen ofGerard de Ath, Peter, Guy, and Andrew de Chanceaux, Guy de Cigogne, and infuture they shall hold no offices in England. Thepeople in question are Engelard de Cigogn, Geoffrey de Martigny and hisbrothers, Philip Marc and his brothers, with Geoffrey his nephew,and all their followers.* As soon as peace is restored, we will remove from the kingdom allthe foreign knights, bowmen, their attendants, and the mercenariesthat have come to it, to its harm, with horses and arms.* To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands,castles, liberties, or rights, without the lawful judgement of hisequals, we will at once restore these. In cases of dispute thematter shall be resolved by the judgement of the twenty-fivebarons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace. Incases, however, where a man was deprived or dispossessed ofsomething without the lawful judgement of his equals by our fatherKing Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in ourhands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall haverespite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless alawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,before we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from theCrusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once render justice infull.* We shall have similar respite in rendering justice in connexionwith forests that are to be disafforested, or to remain forests,when these were first aforested by our father Henry or our brotherRichard; with the guardianship of lands in another persons fee,when we have hitherto had this by virtue of a fee held of us forknights service by a third party; and with abbeys founded inanother persons fee, in which the lord of the fee claims to own aright. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, wewill at once do full justice to complaints about these matters.* No one shall be arrested or imprisoned on the appeal of a womanfor the death of any person except her husband.* All fines that have been given to us unjustly and against the lawof the land, and all fines that we have exacted unjustly, shall beentirely remitted or the matter decided by a majority judgement ofthe twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause forsecuring the peace together with Stephen, archbishop ofCanterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he wishes tobring with him. If the archbishop cannot be present, proceedingsshall continue without him, provided that if any of thetwenty-five barons has been involved in a similar suit himself,his judgement shall be set aside, and someone else chosen andsworn in his place, as a substitute for the single occasion, bythe rest of the twenty-five.* If we have deprived or dispossessed any Welshmen of lands,liberties, or anything else in England or in Wales, without thelawful judgement of their equals, these are at once to be returnedto them. A dispute on this point shall be determined in theMarches by the judgement of equals. English law shall apply toholdings of land in England, Welsh law to those in Wales, and thelaw of the Marches to those in the Marches. The Welsh shall treatus and ours in the same way.* In cases where a Welshman was deprived or dispossessed ofanything, without the lawful judgement of his equals, by ourfather King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains inour hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall haverespite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless alawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order,before we took the Cross as a Crusader. But on our return from theCrusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justiceaccording to the laws of Wales and the said regions.* We will at once return the son of Llywelyn, all Welsh hostages,and the charters delivered to us as security for the peace.* With regard to the return of the sisters and hostages ofAlexander, king of Scotland, his liberties and his rights, we willtreat him in the same way as our other barons of England, unlessit appears from the charters that we hold from his father William,formerly king of Scotland, that he should be treated otherwise.This matter shall be resolved by the judgement of his equals inour court.* All these customs and liberties that we have granted shall beobserved in our kingdom in so far as concerns our own relationswith our subjects. Let all men of our kingdom, whether clergy orlaymen, observe them similarly in their relations with their ownmen.***Strange characters may have ended here.SINCE WE HAVE GRANTED ALL THESE THINGS for God, for the betterordering of our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisenbetween us and our barons, and since we desire that they shall beenjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we giveand grant to the barons the following security:* The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, andcause to be observed with all their might, the peace and libertiesgranted and confirmed to them by this charter.* If we, our chief justice, our officials, or any of our servantsoffend in any respect against any man, or transgress any of thearticles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is madeknown to four of the said twenty-five barons, they shall come tous - or in our absence from the kingdom to the chief justice - todeclare it and claim immediate redress. If we, or in our absenceabroad the chief justice, make no redress within forty days,reckoning from the day on which the offence was declared to us orto him, the four barons shall refer the matter to the rest of thetwenty-five barons, who may distrain upon and assail us in everyway possible, with the support of the whole community of the land,by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, or anything elsesaving only our own person and those of the queen and ourchildren, until they have secured such redress as they havedetermined upon. Having secured the redress, they may then resumetheir normal obedience to us.* Any man who so desires may take an oath to obey the commands ofthe twenty-five barons for the achievement of these ends, and tojoin with them in assailing us to the utmost of his power. We givepublic and free permission to take this oath to any man who sodesires, and at no time will we prohibit any man from taking it.Indeed, we will compel any of our subjects who are unwilling totake it to swear it at our command.* If-one of the twenty-five barons dies or leaves the country, or isprevented in any other way from discharging his duties, the restof them shall choose another baron in his place, at theirdiscretion, who shall be duly sworn in as they were.* In the event of disagreement among the twenty-five barons on anymatter referred to them for decision, the verdict of the majoritypresent shall have the same validity as a unanimous verdict of thewhole twenty-five, whether these were all present or some of thosesummoned were unwilling or unable to appear.* The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articlesfaithfully, and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to thebest of their power.* We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own effortsor those of a third party, anything by which any part of theseconcessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Shouldsuch a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will atno time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party.</p><p id="id00066">We have remitted and pardoned fully to all men any ill-will, hurt, orgrudges that have arisen between us and our subjects, whether clergyor laymen, since the beginning of the dispute.We have in addition remitted fully, and for our own part have alsopardoned, to all clergy and laymen any offences committed as a resultof the said dispute between Easter 1215 AD and the restoration ofpeace.</p><p id="id00067">In addition we have caused letters patent to be made for the barons,bearing witness to this security and to the concessions set out above,over the seals of Stephen archbishop of Canterbury, Henry archbishopof Dublin, the other bishops named above, and Master Pandulf.</p><p id="id00068">IT IS ACCORDINGLY OUR WISH AND COMMAND that the English Church shallbe free, and that men in our kingdom shall have and keep all theseliberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably in theirfulness and entirety for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs, inall things and all places for ever.</p><p id="id00069">Both we and the barons have sworn that all this shall be observed ingood faith and without deceit. Witness the above mentioned people andmany others.</p><p id="id00070">Given by our hand in the meadow that is called Runnymede, betweenWindsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day of June in the seventeenthyear of our reign .</p><p id="id00071">***</p><p id="id00072">[There were many missing spaces in this one, not sure I got them all]</p><p id="id00073">Magna Carta 1215</p><p id="id00074">John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke ofNormandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishops,bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciars, foresters, sheriffs,stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,greeting. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation of oursoul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honor ofGod and the advancement of holy church, and for the reform ofour realm, by advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen archbishop ofCanterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy RomanChurch, Henry archbishop of Dublin, William of London, Peter ofWinchester, Jocelyn of Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter ofWorcester, William of Coventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; ofmaster Pandulf, subdeacon and member of the household of our lord thePope, of brother Aymeric (master of the Knights of the Temple inEngland), and of the illustrious men William Marshall earl of Pembroke,William earl of Salisbury, William earl of Warenne, William earlof Arundel, Alan of Galloway (constable of Scotland), Waren FitzGerald, Peter Fits Herbert, Hubert de Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hughde Neville, Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philipd'Aubigny, Robert of Roppesley, John Marshall, John Fitz Hugh, andothers, our liegemen.</p><p id="id00075">1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our presentcharter confirmed for us and our heirs for ever that the English churchshall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her libertiesinviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent fromthis that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned most importantand very essential to the English church, we, of our pure andunconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm and didobtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope InnocentIII., before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this wewill observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by ourheirs for ever. We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom, forus and our heirs for ever, all the underwritten liberties, to be hadand held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs for ever.</p><p id="id00076">2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief bymilitary service shall have died, and at the time of his death his heirshall be of full age and owe "relief" he shall have his inheritance onpayment of the ancient relief, namely the heir or heirs of an earl, 100pounds for a whole earl's barony; the heir or heirs of a baron, 100pounds for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100 shillingsat most for a whole knight's fee; and whoever owes less let him giveless, according to the ancient custom officers.</p><p id="id00077">3. If, however, the heir of any of the aforesaid has been under ageand in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief andwithout fine when he comes of age.</p><p id="id00078">4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shalltake from the land of the heir nothing but reasonably produce,reasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that withoutdestruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed thewardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to any otherwho is responsible to us for its issues, and he has made destruction orwaste of what he holds in wardship, we will take of him amends, and theland shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fee, whoshall be responsible for the issues to us or to him to whom weshall assign them; and if we have given or sold the wardship of anysuch land to anyone and he has there in made destruction or waste, heshall lose that wardship, and it shall be transferred to two lawful anddiscreet men of that fief, who shall be responsible to us in likemanner as aforesaid.</p><p id="id00079">5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,shall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and otherthings pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; andhe shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all hisland, stocked with ploughs and "waynage," according as the season ofhusbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonably bear.</p><p id="id00080">6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that before themarriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall have notice.</p><p id="id00081">7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith andwithout difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; nor shallshe give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, or forthe inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of the deathof that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husband forfourty days after his death, within which time her dower shall beassigned to her.</p><p id="id00082">8.

No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless bycommon counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, formaking our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldestdaughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than areasonable aid. In like manner it shall be done concerning aids fromthe city of London.</p><p id="id00087">13.

If any one has been dispossessed or removed by us, without thelegal judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, orfrom his right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if adispute arise over this, then let it be decided by the five-and-twentybarons of whom mention is made below in the clause for securing thepeace. Moreover, for all those possessions, from which any one has,without the lawful judgment of his peers, be endisseised or removed, byour father, King Henry, or by our brother, King Richard, and which weretain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we arebound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term ofcrusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised,or an inquest made by our order, before our taking of the cross; but assoon as were turn from our expedition (or if perchance we desist fromthe expedition) we will immediately grant full justice therein.</p><p id="id00127">53. We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same mannerin rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention ofthose forests which Henry our father and Richard our brotherafforested, and concerning wardship of lands which are of the fief ofanother (namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reason of afief which any one held of us by knight's service), and concerningabbeys founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of thefief claims to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desistfrom our expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to allwho complain of such things.</p><p id="id00128">54.

If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in Englandor in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if adispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by thejudgment of their peers; for tenements in England according to the lawof England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales, andfor tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.Welshmen shall do the same to us and ours.</p><p id="id00131">57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed byKing Henry our father or King Richard our brother, and which we retainin our hand (or which are possessed by others, to whom we are bound towarrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term of crusaders;excepting those things about which a plea has been raised or an inquestmade by our order before we took the cross; but as soon as we return(or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we will immediatelygrant full justice in accordance with the laws of the Welsh and inrelation to the foresaid regions.</p><p id="id00132">58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all thehostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security for thepeace.</p><p id="id00133">59. We will do toward Alexander, King of Scots, concerning the returnof his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, and hisright, in the same manner as we shall do toward our other barons ofEngland, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charterswhich we hold from William his father, formerly King of Scots; and thisshall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.</p><p id="id00134">60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, theobservance of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertainsto us toward our men, shall be observed by all of our kingdom, as wellclergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them toward their men.</p><p id="id00135">61. Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and forthe better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and ourbarons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that theyshould enjoy them in complete and firm endurance for ever, we give andgrant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons choosefive-and-twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shallbe bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause to beobserved, the peace and liberties we have granted and confirmed to themby this our present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or ourbailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in anything be at faulttoward any one, or shall have broken any one of the articles ofthe peace or of this security, and the offense be notified to fourbarons of the foresaid five-and-twenty, the said four barons shallrepair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, layingthe transgression before us, petition to have that transgressionredressed without delay. And if we shall not have corrected thetransgression (or, in the event of our being out of the realm, if ourjusticiar shall not have corrected it) within forty days, reckoningfrom the time it has been intimated to us (or to our justiciar, ifwe should be out of the realm), the four barons aforesaid shall referthat matter to the rest of the five-and-twenty barons, and thosefive-and-twenty barons shall, together with the community of the wholeland, distrain and distress us in all possible ways, namely, by seizingour castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way they can, untilredress has been obtained as they deem fit, saving harmless our ownperson, and the persons of our queen and children; and when redress hasbeen obtained, they shall resume their old relations toward us. And letwhoever in the country desires it, swear to obey the orders of the saidfive-and-twenty barons for the execution of all the aforesaid matters,and along with them, to molest us to the utmost of his power; and wepublicly and freely grant leave to every one who wishes to swear, andwe shall never forbid any one to swear. All those, moreover, in theland who of themselves and of their own accord are unwilling to swearto the twenty-five to help them in constraining and molesting us, weshall by our command compel the same to swear to the effect aforesaid.And if any one of the five-and-twenty barons shall have died ordeparted from the land, or be incapacitated in any other manner whichwould prevent the foresaid provisions being carried out, those ofthe said twenty-five barons who are left shall choose another in hisplace according to their own judgment, and he shall be sworn in thesame way as the others. Further, in all matters, the execution of whichis intrusted to these twenty-five barons, if perchance thesetwenty-five are present, that which the majority of those presentordain or command shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as ifthe whole twenty-five had concurred in this; and the said twenty-fiveshall swear that they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid,and cause it to be observed with all their might. And we shall procurenothing from any one, directly or indirectly, whereby any part ofthese concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and ifany such thing has been procured, let it be void and null, and we shallnever use it personally or by another.</p><p id="id00136">62. And all the ill-will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisenbetween us and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel,we have completely remitted and pardoned every one. Moreover, alltrespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in the sixteenthyear of our reign till the restoration of peace, we have fully remittedto all, both clergy and laymen, and completely forgiven, as far aspertains to us. And, on this head, we have caused to be made for themletters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen, archbishop ofCanterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, of the bishopsaforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this security andthe concessions aforesaid.</p><p id="id00137">63. Wherefore it is our will, and we firmly enjoin, that the EnglishChurch be free, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all theaforesaid liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably,freely and quietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs,of us and our heirs, in all respects and in all places for ever, as isaforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as onthe part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall bekept in good faith and without evil intent. Given under our hand—theabove-named and many others being witnesses—in the meadow which iscalled Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth day ofJune, in the seventeenth year of our reign.</p><p id="id00138">***</p><p id="id00139" style="margin-top: 2em">The text of THE MAGNA CARTA</p><p id="id00140" style="margin-top: 2em">The Magna Carta (The Great Charter):</p><p id="id00141">Preamble:</p><p id="id00142" style="margin-top: 2em">John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke ofNormandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishop,bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters, sheriffs,stewards, servants, and to all his bailiffs and liege subjects,greetings. Know that, having regard to God and for the salvation ofour soul, and those of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the honorof God and the advancement of his holy Church and for the rectifyingof our realm, we have granted as underwritten by advice of ourvenerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, primate of allEngland and cardinal of the holy Roman Church, Henry, archbishop ofDublin, William of London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelyn of Bath andGlastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William ofCoventry, Benedict of Rochester, bishops; of Master Pandulf, subdeaconand member of the household of our lord the Pope, of brother Aymeric(master of the Knights of the Temple in England), and of theillustrious men William Marshal, earl of Pembroke, William, earl ofSalisbury, William, earl of Warenne, William, earl of Arundel, Alan ofGalloway (constable of Scotland), Waren Fitz Gerold, Peter FitzHerbert, Hubert De Burgh (seneschal of Poitou), Hugh de Neville,Matthew Fitz Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip d'Aubigny,Robert of Roppesley, John Marshal, John Fitz Hugh, and others, ourliegemen.</p><p id="id00143" style="margin-top: 2em">1. In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our presentcharter confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Churchshall be free, and shall have her rights entire, and her libertiesinviolate; and we will that it be thus observed; which is apparentfrom this that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned mostimportant and very essential to the English Church, we, of our pureand unconstrained will, did grant, and did by our charter confirm anddid obtain the ratification of the same from our lord, Pope InnocentIII, before the quarrel arose between us and our barons: and this wewill observe, and our will is that it be observed in good faith by ourheirs forever. We have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom,for us and our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties, to behad and held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs forever.</p><p id="id00144">2. If any of our earls or barons, or others holding of us in chief bymilitary service shall have died, and at the time of his death hisheir shall be full of age and owe "relief", he shall have hisinheritance by the old relief, to wit, the heir or heirs of an earl,for the whole baroncy of an earl by L100; the heir or heirs of abaron, L100 for a whole barony; the heir or heirs of a knight, 100s,at most, and whoever owes less let him give less, according to theancient custom of fees.</p><p id="id00145" style="margin-top: 2em">3. If, however, the heir of any one of the aforesaid has been underage and in wardship, let him have his inheritance without relief andwithout fine when he comes of age.</p><p id="id00146">4. The guardian of the land of an heir who is thus under age, shalltake from the land of the heir nothing but reasonable produce,reasonable customs, and reasonable services, and that withoutdestruction or waste of men or goods; and if we have committed thewardship of the lands of any such minor to the sheriff, or to anyother who is responsible to us for its issues, and he has madedestruction or waster of what he holds in wardship, we will take ofhim amends, and the land shall be committed to two lawful and discreetmen of that fee, who shall be responsible for the issues to us or tohim to whom we shall assign them; and if we have given or sold thewardship of any such land to anyone and he has therein madedestruction or waste, he shall lose that wardship, and it shall betransferred to two lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall beresponsible to us in like manner as aforesaid.</p><p id="id00147" style="margin-top: 2em">5. The guardian, moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land,shall keep up the houses, parks, fishponds, stanks, mills, and otherthings pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; andhe shall restore to the heir, when he has come to full age, all hisland, stocked with ploughs and wainage, according as the season ofhusbandry shall require, and the issues of the land can reasonablebear.</p><p id="id00148">6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, yet so that beforethe marriage takes place the nearest in blood to that heir shall havenotice.</p><p id="id00149">7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall forthwith andwithout difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance; norshall she give anything for her dower, or for her marriage portion, orfor the inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of thedeath of that husband; and she may remain in the house of her husbandfor forty days after his death, within which time her dower shall beassigned to her.</p><p id="id00150">8. No widow shall be compelled to marry, so long as she prefers tolive without a husband; provided always that she gives security not tomarry without our consent, if she holds of us, or without the consentof the lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another.</p><p id="id00151">9. Neither we nor our bailiffs will seize any land or rent for anydebt, as long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to repaythe debt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so longas the principal debtor is able to satisfy the debt; and if theprincipal debtor shall fail to pay the debt, having nothing wherewithto pay it, then the sureties shall answer for the debt; and let themhave the lands and rents of the debtor, if they desire them, untilthey are indemnified for the debt which they have paid for him, unlessthe principal debtor can show proof that he is discharged thereof asagainst the said sureties.</p><p id="id00152">10. If one who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great or small, diebefore that loan be repaid, the debt shall not bear interest while theheir is under age, of whomsoever he may hold; and if the debt fallinto our hands, we will not take anything except the principal sumcontained in the bond.</p><p id="id00153">11. And if anyone die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have herdower and pay nothing of that debt; and if any children of thedeceased are left under age, necessaries shall be provided for them inkeeping with the holding of the deceased; and out of the residue thedebt shall be paid, reserving, however, service due to feudal lords;in like manner let it be done touching debts due to others than Jews.</p><p id="id00154">12. No scutage not aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless bycommon counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, formaking our eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldestdaughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than areasonable aid.

If anyone has been dispossessed or removed by us, without thelegal judgment of his peers, from his lands, castles, franchises, orfrom his right, we will immediately restore them to him; and if adispute arise over this, then let it be decided by the five and twentybarons of whom mention is made below in the clause for securing thepeace. Moreover, for all those possessions, from which anyone has,without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed,by our father, King Henry, or by our brother, King Richard, and whichwe retain in our hand (or which as possessed by others, to whom we arebound to warrant them) we shall have respite until the usual term ofcrusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raised,or an inquest made by our order, before our taking of the cross; butas soon as we return from the expedition, we will immediately grantfull justice therein.</p><p id="id00195">53. We shall have, moreover, the same respite and in the same mannerin rendering justice concerning the disafforestation or retention ofthose forests which Henry our father and Richard our brotherafforested, and concerning the wardship of lands which are of the fiefof another (namely, such wardships as we have hitherto had by reasonof a fief which anyone held of us by knight's service), and concerningabbeys founded on other fiefs than our own, in which the lord of thefee claims to have right; and when we have returned, or if we desistfrom our expedition, we will immediately grant full justice to all whocomplain of such things.</p><p id="id00196">54. No one shall be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman,for the death of any other than her husband.</p><p id="id00197">55.

If we have disseised or removed Welshmen from lands or liberties,or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers in Englandor in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to them; and if adispute arise over this, then let it be decided in the marches by thejudgment of their peers; for the tenements in England according to thelaw of England, for tenements in Wales according to the law of Wales,and for tenements in the marches according to the law of the marches.Welshmen shall do the same to us and ours.</p><p id="id00199">57. Further, for all those possessions from which any Welshman has,without the lawful judgment of his peers, been disseised or removed byKing Henry our father, or King Richard our brother, and which weretain in our hand (or which are possessed by others, and which weought to warrant), we will have respite until the usual term ofcrusaders; excepting those things about which a plea has been raisedor an inquest made by our order before we took the cross; but as soonas we return (or if perchance we desist from our expedition), we willimmediately grant full justice in accordance with the laws of theWelsh and in relation to the foresaid regions.</p><p id="id00200">58. We will immediately give up the son of Llywelyn and all thehostages of Wales, and the charters delivered to us as security forthe peace.</p><p id="id00201">59. We will do towards Alexander, king of Scots, concerning the returnof his sisters and his hostages, and concerning his franchises, andhis right, in the same manner as we shall do towards our other baronsof England, unless it ought to be otherwise according to the charterswhich we hold from William his father, formerly king of Scots; andthis shall be according to the judgment of his peers in our court.</p><p id="id00202">60. Moreover, all these aforesaid customs and liberties, theobservances of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertainsto us towards our men, shall be observed b all of our kingdom, as wellclergy as laymen, as far as pertains to them towards their men.</p><p id="id00203">61. Since, moveover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and forthe better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and ourbarons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that theyshould enjoy them in complete and firm endurance forever, we give andgrant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the baronschoose five and twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will,who shall be bound with all their might, to observe and hold, andcause to be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted andconfirmed to them by this our present Charter, so that if we, or ourjusticiar, or our bailiffs or any one of our officers, shall inanything be at fault towards anyone, or shall have broken any one ofthe articles of this peace or of this security, and the offense benotified to four barons of the foresaid five and twenty, the said fourbarons shall repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of therealm) and, laying the transgression before us, petition to have thattransgression redressed without delay. And if we shall not havecorrected the transgression (or, in the event of our being out of therealm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected it) within fortydays, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to us (or to ourjusticiar, if we should be out of the realm), the four baronsaforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five and twentybarons, and those five and twenty barons shall, together with thecommunity of the whole realm, distrain and distress us in all possibleways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in anyother way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit,saving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen andchildren; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume theirold relations towards us. And let whoever in the country desires it,swear to obey the orders of the said five and twenty barons for theexecution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molestus to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leaveto everyone who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone toswear.</p><p id="id00204">All those, moveover, in the land who of themselves and of their ownaccord are unwilling to swear to the twenty five to help them inconstraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the sameto swear to the effect foresaid. And if any one of the five andtwenty barons shall have died or departed from the land, or beincapacitated in any other manner which would prevent the foresaidprovisions being carried out, those of the said twenty five barons whoare left shall choose another in his place according to their ownjudgment, and he shall be sworn in the same way as the others.Further, in all matters, the execution of which is entrusted,to thesetwenty five barons, if perchance these twenty five are present anddisagree about anything, or if some of them, after being summoned, areunwilling or unable to be present, that which the majority of thosepresent ordain or command shall be held as fixed and established,exactly as if the whole twenty five had concurred in this; and thesaid twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe allthat is aforesaid, and cause it to be observed with all their might.And we shall procure nothing from anyone, directly or indirectly,whereby any part of these concessions and liberties might be revokedor diminished; and if any such things has been procured, let it bevoid and null, and we shall never use it personally or by another.</p><p id="id00205">62. And all the will, hatreds, and bitterness that have arisen betweenus and our men, clergy and lay, from the date of the quarrel, we havecompletely remitted and pardoned to everyone. Moreover, alltrespasses occasioned by the said quarrel, from Easter in thesixteenth year of our reign till the restoration of peace, we havefully remitted to all, both clergy and laymen, and completelyforgiven, as far as pertains to us. And on this head, we have causedto be made for them letters testimonial patent of the lord Stephen,archbishop of Canterbury, of the lord Henry, archbishop of Dublin, ofthe bishops aforesaid, and of Master Pandulf as touching this securityand the concessions aforesaid.</p><p id="id00206">63. Wherefore we will and firmly order that the English Church befree, and that the men in our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaidliberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably, freely andquietly, fully and wholly, for themselves and their heirs, of us andour heirs, in all respects and in all places forever, as isaforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part ason the part of the barons, that all these conditions aforesaid shall bekept in good faith and without evil intent. Given under our hand -the above named and many others being witnesses - in the meadow whichis called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines, on the fifteenth dayof June, in the seventeenth year of our reign.</p><p id="id00207">***</p><p id="id00208">End of version 0.1 of Project Gutenberg's eBook of The Magna Carta</p><p id="id00209" style="margin-top: 6em">End of Project Gutenberg's The Magna Carta</p><p id="id00210">*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAGNA CARTA ***</p><p id="id00211">This file should be named magna01.txt or magna01.zip<br/>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, magna02.txt<br/>VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, magna10a.txt<br/></p><p id="id00212" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the USunless a copyright notice is included.
