 <h2>
 AUTHOR'S NOTE
 </h2>
 <p>
 When this novel first appeared in book form a notion got about that I had
 been bolted away with. Some reviewers maintained that the work starting as
 a short story had got beyond the writer's control. One or two discovered
 internal evidence of the fact, which seemed to amuse them. They pointed
 out the limitations of the narrative form. They argued that no man could
 have been expected to talk all that time, and other men to listen so long.
 It was not, they said, very credible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After thinking it over for something like sixteen years, I am not so sure
 about that. Men have been known, both in the tropics and in the temperate
 zone, to sit up half the night 'swapping yarns'. This, however, is but one
 yarn, yet with interruptions affording some measure of relief; and in
 regard to the listeners' endurance, the postulate must be accepted that
 the story was interesting. It is the necessary preliminary assumption. If
 I hadn't believed that it was interesting I could never have begun to
 write it. As to the mere physical possibility we all know that some
 speeches in Parliament have taken nearer six than three hours in delivery;
 whereas all that part of the book which is Marlow's narrative can be read
 through aloud, I should say, in less than three hours. Besides?though
 I have kept strictly all such insignificant details out of the tale?we
 may presume that there must have been refreshments on that night, a glass
 of mineral water of some sort to help the narrator on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But, seriously, the truth of the matter is, that my first thought was of a
 short story, concerned only with the pilgrim ship episode; nothing more.
 And that was a legitimate conception. After writing a few pages, however,
 I became for some reason discontented and I laid them aside for a time. I
 didn't take them out of the drawer till the late Mr. William Blackwood
 suggested I should give something again to his magazine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was only then that I perceived that the pilgrim ship episode was a good
 starting-point for a free and wandering tale; that it was an event, too,
 which could conceivably colour the whole 'sentiment of existence' in a
 simple and sensitive character. But all these preliminary moods and
 stirrings of spirit were rather obscure at the time, and they do not
 appear clearer to me now after the lapse of so many years.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The few pages I had laid aside were not without their weight in the choice
 of subject. But the whole was re-written deliberately. When I sat down to
 it I knew it would be a long book, though I didn't foresee that it would
 spread itself over thirteen numbers of Maga.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I have been asked at times whether this was not the book of mine I liked
 best. I am a great foe to favouritism in public life, in private life, and
 even in the delicate relationship of an author to his works. As a matter
 of principle I will have no favourites; but I don't go so far as to feel
 grieved and annoyed by the preference some people give to my Lord Jim. I
 won't even say that I 'fail to understand . . .' No! But once I had
 occasion to be puzzled and surprised.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A friend of mine returning from Italy had talked with a lady there who did
 not like the book. I regretted that, of course, but what surprised me was
 the ground of her dislike. 'You know,' she said, 'it is all so morbid.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The pronouncement gave me food for an hour's anxious thought. Finally I
 arrived at the conclusion that, making due allowances for the subject
 itself being rather foreign to women's normal sensibilities, the lady
 could not have been an Italian. I wonder whether she was European at all?
 In any case, no Latin temperament would have perceived anything morbid in
 the acute consciousness of lost honour. Such a consciousness may be wrong,
 or it may be right, or it may be condemned as artificial; and, perhaps, my
 Jim is not a type of wide commonness. But I can safely assure my readers
 that he is not the product of coldly perverted thinking. He's not a figure
 of Northern Mists either. One sunny morning, in the commonplace
 surroundings of an Eastern roadstead, I saw his form pass by?appealing?significant?under
 a cloud?perfectly silent. Which is as it should be. It was for me,
 with all the sympathy of which I was capable, to seek fit words for his
 meaning. He was 'one of us'.

 LORD JIM

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 1
 </h2>
 <p>
 He was an inch, perhaps two, under six feet, powerfully built, and he
 advanced straight at you with a slight stoop of the shoulders, head
 forward, and a fixed from-under stare which made you think of a charging
 bull. His voice was deep, loud, and his manner displayed a kind of dogged
 self-assertion which had nothing aggressive in it. It seemed a necessity,
 and it was directed apparently as much at himself as at anybody else. He
 was spotlessly neat, apparelled in immaculate white from shoes to hat, and
 in the various Eastern ports where he got his living as ship-chandler's
 water-clerk he was very popular.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A water-clerk need not pass an examination in anything under the sun, but
 he must have Ability in the abstract and demonstrate it practically. His
 work consists in racing under sail, steam, or oars against other
 water-clerks for any ship about to anchor, greeting her captain cheerily,
 forcing upon him a card?the business card of the ship-chandler?and
 on his first visit on shore piloting him firmly but without ostentation to
 a vast, cavern-like shop which is full of things that are eaten and drunk
 on board ship; where you can get everything to make her seaworthy and
 beautiful, from a set of chain-hooks for her cable to a book of gold-leaf
 for the carvings of her stern; and where her commander is received like a
 brother by a ship-chandler he has never seen before. There is a cool
 parlour, easy-chairs, bottles, cigars, writing implements, a copy of
 harbour regulations, and a warmth of welcome that melts the salt of a
 three months' passage out of a seaman's heart. The connection thus begun
 is kept up, as long as the ship remains in harbour, by the daily visits of
 the water-clerk. To the captain he is faithful like a friend and attentive
 like a son, with the patience of Job, the unselfish devotion of a woman,
 and the jollity of a boon companion. Later on the bill is sent in. It is a
 beautiful and humane occupation. Therefore good water-clerks are scarce.
 When a water-clerk who possesses Ability in the abstract has also the
 advantage of having been brought up to the sea, he is worth to his
 employer a lot of money and some humouring. Jim had always good wages and
 as much humouring as would have bought the fidelity of a fiend.
 Nevertheless, with black ingratitude he would throw up the job suddenly
 and depart. To his employers the reasons he gave were obviously
 inadequate. They said 'Confounded fool!' as soon as his back was turned.
 This was their criticism on his exquisite sensibility.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To the white men in the waterside business and to the captains of ships he
 was just Jim?nothing more. He had, of course, another name, but he
 was anxious that it should not be pronounced. His incognito, which had as
 many holes as a sieve, was not meant to hide a personality but a fact.
 When the fact broke through the incognito he would leave suddenly the
 seaport where he happened to be at the time and go to another?generally
 farther east. He kept to seaports because he was a seaman in exile from
 the sea, and had Ability in the abstract, which is good for no other work
 but that of a water-clerk. He retreated in good order towards the rising
 sun, and the fact followed him casually but inevitably. Thus in the course
 of years he was known successively in Bombay, in Calcutta, in Rangoon, in
 Penang, in Batavia?and in each of these halting-places was just Jim
 the water-clerk. Afterwards, when his keen perception of the Intolerable
 drove him away for good from seaports and white men, even into the virgin
 forest, the Malays of the jungle village, where he had elected to conceal
 his deplorable faculty, added a word to the monosyllable of his incognito.
 They called him Tuan Jim: as one might say?Lord Jim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Originally he came from a parsonage. Many commanders of fine
 merchant-ships come from these abodes of piety and peace. Jim's father
 possessed such certain knowledge of the Unknowable as made for the
 righteousness of people in cottages without disturbing the ease of mind of
 those whom an unerring Providence enables to live in mansions. The little
 church on a hill had the mossy greyness of a rock seen through a ragged
 screen of leaves. It had stood there for centuries, but the trees around
 probably remembered the laying of the first stone. Below, the red front of
 the rectory gleamed with a warm tint in the midst of grass-plots,
 flower-beds, and fir-trees, with an orchard at the back, a paved
 stable-yard to the left, and the sloping glass of greenhouses tacked along
 a wall of bricks. The living had belonged to the family for generations;
 but Jim was one of five sons, and when after a course of light holiday
 literature his vocation for the sea had declared itself, he was sent at
 once to a 'training-ship for officers of the mercantile marine.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He learned there a little trigonometry and how to cross top-gallant yards.
 He was generally liked. He had the third place in navigation and pulled
 stroke in the first cutter. Having a steady head with an excellent
 physique, he was very smart aloft. His station was in the fore-top, and
 often from there he looked down, with the contempt of a man destined to
 shine in the midst of dangers, at the peaceful multitude of roofs cut in
 two by the brown tide of the stream, while scattered on the outskirts of
 the surrounding plain the factory chimneys rose perpendicular against a
 grimy sky, each slender like a pencil, and belching out smoke like a
 volcano. He could see the big ships departing, the broad-beamed ferries
 constantly on the move, the little boats floating far below his feet, with
 the hazy splendour of the sea in the distance, and the hope of a stirring
 life in the world of adventure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the lower deck in the babel of two hundred voices he would forget
 himself, and beforehand live in his mind the sea-life of light literature.
 He saw himself saving people from sinking ships, cutting away masts in a
 hurricane, swimming through a surf with a line; or as a lonely castaway,
 barefooted and half naked, walking on uncovered reefs in search of
 shellfish to stave off starvation. He confronted savages on tropical
 shores, quelled mutinies on the high seas, and in a small boat upon the
 ocean kept up the hearts of despairing men?always an example of
 devotion to duty, and as unflinching as a hero in a book.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Something's up. Come along.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He leaped to his feet. The boys were streaming up the ladders. Above could
 be heard a great scurrying about and shouting, and when he got through the
 hatchway he stood still?as if confounded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was the dusk of a winter's day. The gale had freshened since noon,
 stopping the traffic on the river, and now blew with the strength of a
 hurricane in fitful bursts that boomed like salvoes of great guns firing
 over the ocean. The rain slanted in sheets that flicked and subsided, and
 between whiles Jim had threatening glimpses of the tumbling tide, the
 small craft jumbled and tossing along the shore, the motionless buildings
 in the driving mist, the broad ferry-boats pitching ponderously at anchor,
 the vast landing-stages heaving up and down and smothered in sprays. The
 next gust seemed to blow all this away. The air was full of flying water.
 There was a fierce purpose in the gale, a furious earnestness in the
 screech of the wind, in the brutal tumult of earth and sky, that seemed
 directed at him, and made him hold his breath in awe. He stood still. It
 seemed to him he was whirled around.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was jostled. 'Man the cutter!' Boys rushed past him. A coaster running
 in for shelter had crashed through a schooner at anchor, and one of the
 ship's instructors had seen the accident. A mob of boys clambered on the
 rails, clustered round the davits. 'Collision. Just ahead of us. Mr.
 Symons saw it.' A push made him stagger against the mizzen-mast, and he
 caught hold of a rope. The old training-ship chained to her moorings
 quivered all over, bowing gently head to wind, and with her scanty rigging
 humming in a deep bass the breathless song of her youth at sea. 'Lower
 away!' He saw the boat, manned, drop swiftly below the rail, and rushed
 after her. He heard a splash. 'Let go; clear the falls!' He leaned over.
 The river alongside seethed in frothy streaks. The cutter could be seen in
 the falling darkness under the spell of tide and wind, that for a moment
 held her bound, and tossing abreast of the ship. A yelling voice in her
 reached him faintly: 'Keep stroke, you young whelps, if you want to save
 anybody! Keep stroke!' And suddenly she lifted high her bow, and, leaping
 with raised oars over a wave, broke the spell cast upon her by the wind
 and tide.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim felt his shoulder gripped firmly. 'Too late, youngster.' The captain
 of the ship laid a restraining hand on that boy, who seemed on the point
 of leaping overboard, and Jim looked up with the pain of conscious defeat
 in his eyes. The captain smiled sympathetically. 'Better luck next time.
 This will teach you to be smart.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A shrill cheer greeted the cutter. She came dancing back half full of
 water, and with two exhausted men washing about on her bottom boards. The
 tumult and the menace of wind and sea now appeared very contemptible to
 Jim, increasing the regret of his awe at their inefficient menace. Now he
 knew what to think of it. It seemed to him he cared nothing for the gale.
 He could affront greater perils. He would do so?better than anybody.
 Not a particle of fear was left. Nevertheless he brooded apart that
 evening while the bowman of the cutter?a boy with a face like a
 girl's and big grey eyes?was the hero of the lower deck. Eager
 questioners crowded round him. He narrated: 'I just saw his head bobbing,
 and I dashed my boat-hook in the water. It caught in his breeches and I
 nearly went overboard, as I thought I would, only old Symons let go the
 tiller and grabbed my legs?the boat nearly swamped. Old Symons is a
 fine old chap. I don't mind a bit him being grumpy with us. He swore at me
 all the time he held my leg, but that was only his way of telling me to
 stick to the boat-hook. Old Symons is awfully excitable?isn't he? No?not
 the little fair chap?the other, the big one with a beard. When we
 pulled him in he groaned, "Oh, my leg! oh, my leg!" and turned up his
 eyes. Fancy such a big chap fainting like a girl. Would any of you fellows
 faint for a jab with a boat-hook??I wouldn't. It went into his leg
 so far.' He showed the boat-hook, which he had carried below for the
 purpose, and produced a sensation. 'No, silly! It was not his flesh that
 held him?his breeches did. Lots of blood, of course.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim thought it a pitiful display of vanity. The gale had ministered to a
 heroism as spurious as its own pretence of terror. He felt angry with the
 brutal tumult of earth and sky for taking him unawares and checking
 unfairly a generous readiness for narrow escapes. Otherwise he was rather
 glad he had not gone into the cutter, since a lower achievement had served
 the turn. He had enlarged his knowledge more than those who had done the
 work. When all men flinched, then?he felt sure?he alone would
 know how to deal with the spurious menace of wind and seas. He knew what
 to think of it. Seen dispassionately, it seemed contemptible. He could
 detect no trace of emotion in himself, and the final effect of a
 staggering event was that, unnoticed and apart from the noisy crowd of
 boys, he exulted with fresh certitude in his avidity for adventure, and in
 a sense of many-sided courage.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 2
 </h2>
 <p>
 After two years of training he went to sea, and entering the regions so
 well known to his imagination, found them strangely barren of adventure.
 He made many voyages. He knew the magic monotony of existence between sky
 and water: he had to bear the criticism of men, the exactions of the sea,
 and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread?but
 whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work. This reward eluded
 him. Yet he could not go back, because there is nothing more enticing,
 disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea. Besides, his prospects
 were good. He was gentlemanly, steady, tractable, with a thorough
 knowledge of his duties; and in time, when yet very young, he became chief
 mate of a fine ship, without ever having been tested by those events of
 the sea that show in the light of day the inner worth of a man, the edge
 of his temper, and the fibre of his stuff; that reveal the quality of his
 resistance and the secret truth of his pretences, not only to others but
 also to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Only once in all that time he had again a glimpse of the earnestness in
 the anger of the sea. That truth is not so often made apparent as people
 might think. There are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales,
 and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a
 sinister violence of intention?that indefinable something which
 forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man, that this complication of
 accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of
 malice, with a strength beyond control, with an unbridled cruelty that
 means to tear out of him his hope and his fear, the pain of his fatigue
 and his longing for rest: which means to smash, to destroy, to annihilate
 all he has seen, known, loved, enjoyed, or hated; all that is priceless
 and necessary?the sunshine, the memories, the future; which means to
 sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple
 and appalling act of taking his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim, disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his
 Scottish captain used to say afterwards, 'Man! it's a pairfect meeracle to
 me how she lived through it!' spent many days stretched on his back,
 dazed, battered, hopeless, and tormented as if at the bottom of an abyss
 of unrest. He did not care what the end would be, and in his lucid moments
 overvalued his indifference. The danger, when not seen, has the imperfect
 vagueness of human thought. The fear grows shadowy; and Imagination, the
 enemy of men, the father of all terrors, unstimulated, sinks to rest in
 the dullness of exhausted emotion. Jim saw nothing but the disorder of his
 tossed cabin. He lay there battened down in the midst of a small
 devastation, and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck. But now and
 again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily, make him
 gasp and writhe under the blankets, and then the unintelligent brutality
 of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a
 despairing desire to escape at any cost. Then fine weather returned, and
 he thought no more about It.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His lameness, however, persisted, and when the ship arrived at an Eastern
 port he had to go to the hospital. His recovery was slow, and he was left
 behind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There were only two other patients in the white men's ward: the purser of
 a gunboat, who had broken his leg falling down a hatchway; and a kind of
 railway contractor from a neighbouring province, afflicted by some
 mysterious tropical disease, who held the doctor for an ass, and indulged
 in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his Tamil servant used to
 smuggle in with unwearied devotion. They told each other the story of
 their lives, played cards a little, or, yawning and in pyjamas, lounged
 through the day in easy-chairs without saying a word. The hospital stood
 on a hill, and a gentle breeze entering through the windows, always flung
 wide open, brought into the bare room the softness of the sky, the languor
 of the earth, the bewitching breath of the Eastern waters. There were
 perfumes in it, suggestions of infinite repose, the gift of endless
 dreams. Jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens, beyond the
 roofs of the town, over the fronds of palms growing on the shore, at that
 roadstead which is a thoroughfare to the East,?at the roadstead
 dotted by garlanded islets, lighted by festal sunshine, its ships like
 toys, its brilliant activity resembling a holiday pageant, with the
 eternal serenity of the Eastern sky overhead and the smiling peace of the
 Eastern seas possessing the space as far as the horizon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Directly he could walk without a stick, he descended into the town to look
 for some opportunity to get home. Nothing offered just then, and, while
 waiting, he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port.
 These were of two kinds. Some, very few and seen there but seldom, led
 mysterious lives, had preserved an undefaced energy with the temper of
 buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers. They appeared to live in a crazy maze
 of plans, hopes, dangers, enterprises, ahead of civilisation, in the dark
 places of the sea; and their death was the only event of their fantastic
 existence that seemed to have a reasonable certitude of achievement. The
 majority were men who, like himself, thrown there by some accident, had
 remained as officers of country ships. They had now a horror of the home
 service, with its harder conditions, severer view of duty, and the hazard
 of stormy oceans. They were attuned to the eternal peace of Eastern sky
 and sea. They loved short passages, good deck-chairs, large native crews,
 and the distinction of being white. They shuddered at the thought of hard
 work, and led precariously easy lives, always on the verge of dismissal,
 always on the verge of engagement, serving Chinamen, Arabs, half-castes?would
 have served the devil himself had he made it easy enough. They talked
 everlastingly of turns of luck: how So-and-so got charge of a boat on the
 coast of China?a soft thing; how this one had an easy billet in
 Japan somewhere, and that one was doing well in the Siamese navy; and in
 all they said?in their actions, in their looks, in their persons?could
 be detected the soft spot, the place of decay, the determination to lounge
 safely through existence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To Jim that gossiping crowd, viewed as seamen, seemed at first more
 unsubstantial than so many shadows. But at length he found a fascination
 in the sight of those men, in their appearance of doing so well on such a
 small allowance of danger and toil. In time, beside the original disdain
 there grew up slowly another sentiment; and suddenly, giving up the idea
 of going home, he took a berth as chief mate of the Patna.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Patna was a local steamer as old as the hills, lean like a greyhound,
 and eaten up with rust worse than a condemned water-tank. She was owned by
 a Chinaman, chartered by an Arab, and commanded by a sort of renegade New
 South Wales German, very anxious to curse publicly his native country, but
 who, apparently on the strength of Bismarck's victorious policy,
 brutalised all those he was not afraid of, and wore a 'blood-and-iron'
 air,' combined with a purple nose and a red moustache. After she had been
 painted outside and whitewashed inside, eight hundred pilgrims (more or
 less) were driven on board of her as she lay with steam up alongside a
 wooden jetty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They streamed aboard over three gangways, they streamed in urged by faith
 and the hope of paradise, they streamed in with a continuous tramp and
 shuffle of bare feet, without a word, a murmur, or a look back; and when
 clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck, flowed forward
 and aft, overflowed down the yawning hatchways, filled the inner recesses
 of the ship?like water filling a cistern, like water flowing into
 crevices and crannies, like water rising silently even with the rim. Eight
 hundred men and women with faith and hopes, with affections and memories,
 they had collected there, coming from north and south and from the
 outskirts of the East, after treading the jungle paths, descending the
 rivers, coasting in praus along the shallows, crossing in small canoes
 from island to island, passing through suffering, meeting strange sights,
 beset by strange fears, upheld by one desire. They came from solitary huts
 in the wilderness, from populous campongs, from villages by the sea. At
 the call of an idea they had left their forests, their clearings, the
 protection of their rulers, their prosperity, their poverty, the
 surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers. They came
 covered with dust, with sweat, with grime, with rags?the strong men
 at the head of family parties, the lean old men pressing forward without
 hope of return; young boys with fearless eyes glancing curiously, shy
 little girls with tumbled long hair; the timid women muffled up and
 clasping to their breasts, wrapped in loose ends of soiled head-cloths,
 their sleeping babies, the unconscious pilgrims of an exacting belief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Look at dese cattle,' said the German skipper to his new chief mate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An Arab, the leader of that pious voyage, came last. He walked slowly
 aboard, handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban. A string of
 servants followed, loaded with his luggage; the Patna cast off and backed
 away from the wharf.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was headed between two small islets, crossed obliquely the
 anchoring-ground of sailing-ships, swung through half a circle in the
 shadow of a hill, then ranged close to a ledge of foaming reefs. The Arab,
 standing up aft, recited aloud the prayer of travellers by sea. He invoked
 the favour of the Most High upon that journey, implored His blessing on
 men's toil and on the secret purposes of their hearts; the steamer pounded
 in the dusk the calm water of the Strait; and far astern of the pilgrim
 ship a screw-pile lighthouse, planted by unbelievers on a treacherous
 shoal, seemed to wink at her its eye of flame, as if in derision of her
 errand of faith.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She cleared the Strait, crossed the bay, continued on her way through the
 'One-degree' passage. She held on straight for the Red Sea under a serene
 sky, under a sky scorching and unclouded, enveloped in a fulgor of
 sunshine that killed all thought, oppressed the heart, withered all
 impulses of strength and energy. And under the sinister splendour of that
 sky the sea, blue and profound, remained still, without a stir, without a
 ripple, without a wrinkle?viscous, stagnant, dead. The Patna, with a
 slight hiss, passed over that plain, luminous and smooth, unrolled a black
 ribbon of smoke across the sky, left behind her on the water a white
 ribbon of foam that vanished at once, like the phantom of a track drawn
 upon a lifeless sea by the phantom of a steamer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every morning the sun, as if keeping pace in his revolutions with the
 progress of the pilgrimage, emerged with a silent burst of light exactly
 at the same distance astern of the ship, caught up with her at noon,
 pouring the concentrated fire of his rays on the pious purposes of the
 men, glided past on his descent, and sank mysteriously into the sea
 evening after evening, preserving the same distance ahead of her advancing
 bows. The five whites on board lived amidships, isolated from the human
 cargo. The awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern,
 and a faint hum, a low murmur of sad voices, alone revealed the presence
 of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean. Such were the
 days, still, hot, heavy, disappearing one by one into the past, as if
 falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship; and the ship,
 lonely under a wisp of smoke, held on her steadfast way black and
 smouldering in a luminous immensity, as if scorched by a flame flicked at
 her from a heaven without pity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nights descended on her like a benediction.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 3
 </h2>
 <p>
 A marvellous stillness pervaded the world, and the stars, together with
 the serenity of their rays, seemed to shed upon the earth the assurance of
 everlasting security. The young moon recurved, and shining low in the
 west, was like a slender shaving thrown up from a bar of gold, and the
 Arabian Sea, smooth and cool to the eye like a sheet of ice, extended its
 perfect level to the perfect circle of a dark horizon. The propeller
 turned without a check, as though its beat had been part of the scheme of
 a safe universe; and on each side of the Patna two deep folds of water,
 permanent and sombre on the unwrinkled shimmer, enclosed within their
 straight and diverging ridges a few white swirls of foam bursting in a low
 hiss, a few wavelets, a few ripples, a few undulations that, left behind,
 agitated the surface of the sea for an instant after the passage of the
 ship, subsided splashing gently, calmed down at last into the circular
 stillness of water and sky with the black speck of the moving hull
 remaining everlastingly in its centre.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim on the bridge was penetrated by the great certitude of unbounded
 safety and peace that could be read on the silent aspect of nature like
 the certitude of fostering love upon the placid tenderness of a mother's
 face. Below the roof of awnings, surrendered to the wisdom of white men
 and to their courage, trusting the power of their unbelief and the iron
 shell of their fire-ship, the pilgrims of an exacting faith slept on mats,
 on blankets, on bare planks, on every deck, in all the dark corners,
 wrapped in dyed cloths, muffled in soiled rags, with their heads resting
 on small bundles, with their faces pressed to bent forearms: the men, the
 women, the children; the old with the young, the decrepit with the lusty?all
 equal before sleep, death's brother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A draught of air, fanned from forward by the speed of the ship, passed
 steadily through the long gloom between the high bulwarks, swept over the
 rows of prone bodies; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung short here
 and there under the ridge-poles, and in the blurred circles of light
 thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration of the ship
 appeared a chin upturned, two closed eyelids, a dark hand with silver
 rings, a meagre limb draped in a torn covering, a head bent back, a naked
 foot, a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself to the knife. The
 well-to-do had made for their families shelters with heavy boxes and dusty
 mats; the poor reposed side by side with all they had on earth tied up in
 a rag under their heads; the lone old men slept, with drawn-up legs, upon
 their prayer-carpets, with their hands over their ears and one elbow on
 each side of the face; a father, his shoulders up and his knees under his
 forehead, dozed dejectedly by a boy who slept on his back with tousled
 hair and one arm commandingly extended; a woman covered from head to foot,
 like a corpse, with a piece of white sheeting, had a naked child in the
 hollow of each arm; the Arab's belongings, piled right aft, made a heavy
 mound of broken outlines, with a cargo-lamp swung above, and a great
 confusion of vague forms behind: gleams of paunchy brass pots, the
 foot-rest of a deck-chair, blades of spears, the straight scabbard of an
 old sword leaning against a heap of pillows, the spout of a tin
 coffee-pot. The patent log on the taffrail periodically rang a single
 tinkling stroke for every mile traversed on an errand of faith. Above the
 mass of sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated, the exhalation
 of a troubled dream; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in
 the depths of the ship, the harsh scrape of a shovel, the violent slam of
 a furnace-door, exploded brutally, as if the men handling the mysterious
 things below had their breasts full of fierce anger: while the slim high
 hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead, without a sway of her bare
 masts, cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the
 inaccessible serenity of the sky.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim paced athwart, and his footsteps in the vast silence were loud to his
 own ears, as if echoed by the watchful stars: his eyes, roaming about the
 line of the horizon, seemed to gaze hungrily into the unattainable, and
 did not see the shadow of the coming event. The only shadow on the sea was
 the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from the funnel its immense
 streamer, whose end was constantly dissolving in the air. Two Malays,
 silent and almost motionless, steered, one on each side of the wheel,
 whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval of light thrown out by the
 binnacle. Now and then a hand, with black fingers alternately letting go
 and catching hold of revolving spokes, appeared in the illumined part; the
 links of wheel-chains ground heavily in the grooves of the barrel. Jim
 would glance at the compass, would glance around the unattainable horizon,
 would stretch himself till his joints cracked, with a leisurely twist of
 the body, in the very excess of well-being; and, as if made audacious by
 the invincible aspect of the peace, he felt he cared for nothing that
 could happen to him to the end of his days. From time to time he glanced
 idly at a chart pegged out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged
 table abaft the steering-gear case. The sheet of paper portraying the
 depths of the sea presented a shiny surface under the light of a
 bull's-eye lamp lashed to a stanchion, a surface as level and smooth as
 the glimmering surface of the waters. Parallel rulers with a pair of
 dividers reposed on it; the ship's position at last noon was marked with a
 small black cross, and the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as
 Perim figured the course of the ship?the path of souls towards the
 holy place, the promise of salvation, the reward of eternal life?while
 the pencil with its sharp end touching the Somali coast lay round and
 still like a naked ship's spar floating in the pool of a sheltered dock.
 'How steady she goes,' thought Jim with wonder, with something like
 gratitude for this high peace of sea and sky. At such times his thoughts
 would be full of valorous deeds: he loved these dreams and the success of
 his imaginary achievements. They were the best parts of life, its secret
 truth, its hidden reality. They had a gorgeous virility, the charm of
 vagueness, they passed before him with an heroic tread; they carried his
 soul away with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an
 unbounded confidence in itself. There was nothing he could not face. He
 was so pleased with the idea that he smiled, keeping perfunctorily his
 eyes ahead; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of
 the wake drawn as straight by the ship's keel upon the sea as the black
 line drawn by the pencil upon the chart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ash-buckets racketed, clanking up and down the stoke-hold ventilators,
 and this tin-pot clatter warned him the end of his watch was near. He
 sighed with content, with regret as well at having to part from that
 serenity which fostered the adventurous freedom of his thoughts. He was a
 little sleepy too, and felt a pleasurable languor running through every
 limb as though all the blood in his body had turned to warm milk. His
 skipper had come up noiselessly, in pyjamas and with his sleeping-jacket
 flung wide open. Red of face, only half awake, the left eye partly closed,
 the right staring stupid and glassy, he hung his big head over the chart
 and scratched his ribs sleepily. There was something obscene in the sight
 of his naked flesh. His bared breast glistened soft and greasy as though
 he had sweated out his fat in his sleep. He pronounced a professional
 remark in a voice harsh and dead, resembling the rasping sound of a
 wood-file on the edge of a plank; the fold of his double chin hung like a
 bag triced up close under the hinge of his jaw. Jim started, and his
 answer was full of deference; but the odious and fleshy figure, as though
 seen for the first time in a revealing moment, fixed itself in his memory
 for ever as the incarnation of everything vile and base that lurks in the
 world we love: in our own hearts we trust for our salvation, in the men
 that surround us, in the sights that fill our eyes, in the sounds that
 fill our ears, and in the air that fills our lungs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The thin gold shaving of the moon floating slowly downwards had lost
 itself on the darkened surface of the waters, and the eternity beyond the
 sky seemed to come down nearer to the earth, with the augmented glitter of
 the stars, with the more profound sombreness in the lustre of the
 half-transparent dome covering the flat disc of an opaque sea. The ship
 moved so smoothly that her onward motion was imperceptible to the senses
 of men, as though she had been a crowded planet speeding through the dark
 spaces of ether behind the swarm of suns, in the appalling and calm
 solitudes awaiting the breath of future creations. 'Hot is no name for it
 down below,' said a voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim smiled without looking round. The skipper presented an unmoved breadth
 of back: it was the renegade's trick to appear pointedly unaware of your
 existence unless it suited his purpose to turn at you with a devouring
 glare before he let loose a torrent of foamy, abusive jargon that came
 like a gush from a sewer. Now he emitted only a sulky grunt; the second
 engineer at the head of the bridge-ladder, kneading with damp palms a
 dirty sweat-rag, unabashed, continued the tale of his complaints. The
 sailors had a good time of it up here, and what was the use of them in the
 world he would be blowed if he could see. The poor devils of engineers had
 to get the ship along anyhow, and they could very well do the rest too; by
 gosh they?'Shut up!' growled the German stolidly. 'Oh yes! Shut up?and
 when anything goes wrong you fly to us, don't you?' went on the other. He
 was more than half cooked, he expected; but anyway, now, he did not mind
 how much he sinned, because these last three days he had passed through a
 fine course of training for the place where the bad boys go when they die?b'gosh,
 he had?besides being made jolly well deaf by the blasted racket
 below. The durned, compound, surface-condensing, rotten scrap-heap rattled
 and banged down there like an old deck-winch, only more so; and what made
 him risk his life every night and day that God made amongst the refuse of
 a breaking-up yard flying round at fifty-seven revolutions, was more than
 <i>he</i> could tell. He must have been born reckless, b'gosh. He . . .
 'Where did you get drink?' inquired the German, very savage; but
 motionless in the light of the binnacle, like a clumsy effigy of a man cut
 out of a block of fat. Jim went on smiling at the retreating horizon; his
 heart was full of generous impulses, and his thought was contemplating his
 own superiority. 'Drink!' repeated the engineer with amiable scorn: he was
 hanging on with both hands to the rail, a shadowy figure with flexible
 legs. 'Not from you, captain. You're far too mean, b'gosh. You would let a
 good man die sooner than give him a drop of schnapps. That's what you
 Germans call economy. Penny wise, pound foolish.' He became sentimental.
 The chief had given him a four-finger nip about ten o'clock?'only
 one, s'elp me!'?good old chief; but as to getting the old fraud out
 of his bunk?a five-ton crane couldn't do it. Not it. Not to-night
 anyhow. He was sleeping sweetly like a little child, with a bottle of
 prime brandy under his pillow. From the thick throat of the commander of
 the Patna came a low rumble, on which the sound of the word schwein
 fluttered high and low like a capricious feather in a faint stir of air.
 He and the chief engineer had been cronies for a good few years?serving
 the same jovial, crafty, old Chinaman, with horn-rimmed goggles and
 strings of red silk plaited into the venerable grey hairs of his pigtail.
 The quay-side opinion in the Patna's home-port was that these two in the
 way of brazen peculation 'had done together pretty well everything you can
 think of.' Outwardly they were badly matched: one dull-eyed, malevolent,
 and of soft fleshy curves; the other lean, all hollows, with a head long
 and bony like the head of an old horse, with sunken cheeks, with sunken
 temples, with an indifferent glazed glance of sunken eyes. He had been
 stranded out East somewhere?in Canton, in Shanghai, or perhaps in
 Yokohama; he probably did not care to remember himself the exact locality,
 nor yet the cause of his shipwreck. He had been, in mercy to his youth,
 kicked quietly out of his ship twenty years ago or more, and it might have
 been so much worse for him that the memory of the episode had in it hardly
 a trace of misfortune. Then, steam navigation expanding in these seas and
 men of his craft being scarce at first, he had 'got on' after a sort. He
 was eager to let strangers know in a dismal mumble that he was 'an old
 stager out here.' When he moved, a skeleton seemed to sway loose in his
 clothes; his walk was mere wandering, and he was given to wander thus
 around the engine-room skylight, smoking, without relish, doctored tobacco
 in a brass bowl at the end of a cherrywood stem four feet long, with the
 imbecile gravity of a thinker evolving a system of philosophy from the
 hazy glimpse of a truth. He was usually anything but free with his private
 store of liquor; but on that night he had departed from his principles, so
 that his second, a weak-headed child of Wapping, what with the
 unexpectedness of the treat and the strength of the stuff, had become very
 happy, cheeky, and talkative. The fury of the New South Wales German was
 extreme; he puffed like an exhaust-pipe, and Jim, faintly amused by the
 scene, was impatient for the time when he could get below: the last ten
 minutes of the watch were irritating like a gun that hangs fire; those men
 did not belong to the world of heroic adventure; they weren't bad chaps
 though. Even the skipper himself . . . His gorge rose at the mass of
 panting flesh from which issued gurgling mutters, a cloudy trickle of
 filthy expressions; but he was too pleasurably languid to dislike actively
 this or any other thing. The quality of these men did not matter; he
 rubbed shoulders with them, but they could not touch him; he shared the
 air they breathed, but he was different. . . . Would the skipper go for
 the engineer? . . . The life was easy and he was too sure of himself?too
 sure of himself to . . . The line dividing his meditation from a
 surreptitious doze on his feet was thinner than a thread in a spider's
 web.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The second engineer was coming by easy transitions to the consideration of
 his finances and of his courage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Who's drunk? I? No, no, captain! That won't do. You ought to know by this
 time the chief ain't free-hearted enough to make a sparrow drunk, b'gosh.
 I've never been the worse for liquor in my life; the stuff ain't made yet
 that would make <i>me</i> drunk. I could drink liquid fire against your
 whisky peg for peg, b'gosh, and keep as cool as a cucumber. If I thought I
 was drunk I would jump overboard?do away with myself, b'gosh. I
 would! Straight! And I won't go off the bridge. Where do you expect me to
 take the air on a night like this, eh? On deck amongst that vermin down
 there? Likely?ain't it! And I am not afraid of anything you can do.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The German lifted two heavy fists to heaven and shook them a little
 without a word.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I don't know what fear is,' pursued the engineer, with the enthusiasm of
 sincere conviction. 'I am not afraid of doing all the bloomin' work in
 this rotten hooker, b'gosh! And a jolly good thing for you that there are
 some of us about the world that aren't afraid of their lives, or where
 would you be?you and this old thing here with her plates like brown
 paper?brown paper, s'elp me? It's all very fine for you?you
 get a power of pieces out of her one way and another; but what about me?what
 do I get? A measly hundred and fifty dollars a month and find yourself. I
 wish to ask you respectfully?respectfully, mind?who wouldn't
 chuck a dratted job like this? 'Tain't safe, s'elp me, it ain't! Only I am
 one of them fearless fellows . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He let go the rail and made ample gestures as if demonstrating in the air
 the shape and extent of his valour; his thin voice darted in prolonged
 squeaks upon the sea, he tiptoed back and forth for the better emphasis of
 utterance, and suddenly pitched down head-first as though he had been
 clubbed from behind. He said 'Damn!' as he tumbled; an instant of silence
 followed upon his screeching: Jim and the skipper staggered forward by
 common accord, and catching themselves up, stood very stiff and still
 gazing, amazed, at the undisturbed level of the sea. Then they looked
 upwards at the stars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What had happened? The wheezy thump of the engines went on. Had the earth
 been checked in her course? They could not understand; and suddenly the
 calm sea, the sky without a cloud, appeared formidably insecure in their
 immobility, as if poised on the brow of yawning destruction. The engineer
 rebounded vertically full length and collapsed again into a vague heap.
 This heap said 'What's that?' in the muffled accents of profound grief. A
 faint noise as of thunder, of thunder infinitely remote, less than a
 sound, hardly more than a vibration, passed slowly, and the ship quivered
 in response, as if the thunder had growled deep down in the water. The
 eyes of the two Malays at the wheel glittered towards the white men, but
 their dark hands remained closed on the spokes. The sharp hull driving on
 its way seemed to rise a few inches in succession through its whole
 length, as though it had become pliable, and settled down again rigidly to
 its work of cleaving the smooth surface of the sea. Its quivering stopped,
 and the faint noise of thunder ceased all at once, as though the ship had
 steamed across a narrow belt of vibrating water and of humming air.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 4
 </h2>
 <p>
 A month or so afterwards, when Jim, in answer to pointed questions, tried
 to tell honestly the truth of this experience, he said, speaking of the
 ship: 'She went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a
 stick.' The illustration was good: the questions were aiming at facts, and
 the official Inquiry was being held in the police court of an Eastern
 port. He stood elevated in the witness-box, with burning cheeks in a cool
 lofty room: the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high
 above his head, and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark
 faces, out of white faces, out of red faces, out of faces attentive,
 spellbound, as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow
 benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice. It was very
 loud, it rang startling in his own ears, it was the only sound audible in
 the world, for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers
 seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast,?came
 to him poignant and silent like the terrible questioning of one's
 conscience. Outside the court the sun blazed?within was the wind of
 great punkahs that made you shiver, the shame that made you burn, the
 attentive eyes whose glance stabbed. The face of the presiding magistrate,
 clean shaved and impassible, looked at him deadly pale between the red
 faces of the two nautical assessors. The light of a broad window under the
 ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men, and
 they were fiercely distinct in the half-light of the big court-room where
 the audience seemed composed of staring shadows. They wanted facts. Facts!
 They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'After you had concluded you had collided with something floating awash,
 say a water-logged wreck, you were ordered by your captain to go forward
 and ascertain if there was any damage done. Did you think it likely from
 the force of the blow?' asked the assessor sitting to the left. He had a
 thin horseshoe beard, salient cheek-bones, and with both elbows on the
 desk clasped his rugged hands before his face, looking at Jim with
 thoughtful blue eyes; the other, a heavy, scornful man, thrown back in his
 seat, his left arm extended full length, drummed delicately with his
 finger-tips on a blotting-pad: in the middle the magistrate upright in the
 roomy arm-chair, his head inclined slightly on the shoulder, had his arms
 crossed on his breast and a few flowers in a glass vase by the side of his
 inkstand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I did not,' said Jim. 'I was told to call no one and to make no noise for
 fear of creating a panic. I thought the precaution reasonable. I took one
 of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward. After
 opening the forepeak hatch I heard splashing in there. I lowered then the
 lamp the whole drift of its lanyard, and saw that the forepeak was more
 than half full of water already. I knew then there must be a big hole
 below the water-line.' He paused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Yes,' said the big assessor, with a dreamy smile at the blotting-pad; his
 fingers played incessantly, touching the paper without noise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I did not think of danger just then. I might have been a little startled:
 all this happened in such a quiet way and so very suddenly. I knew there
 was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating
 the forepeak from the forehold. I went back to tell the captain. I came
 upon the second engineer getting up at the foot of the bridge-ladder: he
 seemed dazed, and told me he thought his left arm was broken; he had
 slipped on the top step when getting down while I was forward. He
 exclaimed, "My God! That rotten bulkhead'll give way in a minute, and the
 damned thing will go down under us like a lump of lead." He pushed me away
 with his right arm and ran before me up the ladder, shouting as he
 climbed. His left arm hung by his side. I followed up in time to see the
 captain rush at him and knock him down flat on his back. He did not strike
 him again: he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low. I
 fancy he was asking him why the devil he didn't go and stop the engines,
 instead of making a row about it on deck. I heard him say, "Get up! Run!
 fly!" He swore also. The engineer slid down the starboard ladder and
 bolted round the skylight to the engine-room companion which was on the
 port side. He moaned as he ran. . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He spoke slowly; he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness; he
 could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the
 better information of these men who wanted facts. After his first feeling
 of revolt he had come round to the view that only a meticulous precision
 of statement would bring out the true horror behind the appalling face of
 things. The facts those men were so eager to know had been visible,
 tangible, open to the senses, occupying their place in space and time,
 requiring for their existence a fourteen-hundred-ton steamer and
 twenty-seven minutes by the watch; they made a whole that had features,
 shades of expression, a complicated aspect that could be remembered by the
 eye, and something else besides, something invisible, a directing spirit
 of perdition that dwelt within, like a malevolent soul in a detestable
 body. He was anxious to make this clear. This had not been a common
 affair, everything in it had been of the utmost importance, and
 fortunately he remembered everything. He wanted to go on talking for
 truth's sake, perhaps for his own sake also; and while his utterance was
 deliberate, his mind positively flew round and round the serried circle of
 facts that had surged up all about him to cut him off from the rest of his
 kind: it was like a creature that, finding itself imprisoned within an
 enclosure of high stakes, dashes round and round, distracted in the night,
 trying to find a weak spot, a crevice, a place to scale, some opening
 through which it may squeeze itself and escape. This awful activity of
 mind made him hesitate at times in his speech. . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The captain kept on moving here and there on the bridge; he seemed calm
 enough, only he stumbled several times; and once as I stood speaking to
 him he walked right into me as though he had been stone-blind. He made no
 definite answer to what I had to tell. He mumbled to himself; all I heard
 of it were a few words that sounded like "confounded steam!" and "infernal
 steam!"?something about steam. I thought . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was becoming irrelevant; a question to the point cut short his speech,
 like a pang of pain, and he felt extremely discouraged and weary. He was
 coming to that, he was coming to that?and now, checked brutally, he
 had to answer by yes or no. He answered truthfully by a curt 'Yes, I did';
 and fair of face, big of frame, with young, gloomy eyes, he held his
 shoulders upright above the box while his soul writhed within him. He was
 made to answer another question so much to the point and so useless, then
 waited again. His mouth was tastelessly dry, as though he had been eating
 dust, then salt and bitter as after a drink of sea-water. He wiped his
 damp forehead, passed his tongue over parched lips, felt a shiver run down
 his back. The big assessor had dropped his eyelids, and drummed on without
 a sound, careless and mournful; the eyes of the other above the sunburnt,
 clasped fingers seemed to glow with kindliness; the magistrate had swayed
 forward; his pale face hovered near the flowers, and then dropping
 sideways over the arm of his chair, he rested his temple in the palm of
 his hand. The wind of the punkahs eddied down on the heads, on the
 dark-faced natives wound about in voluminous draperies, on the Europeans
 sitting together very hot and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as
 close as their skins, and holding their round pith hats on their knees;
 while gliding along the walls the court peons, buttoned tight in long
 white coats, flitted rapidly to and fro, running on bare toes, red-sashed,
 red turban on head, as noiseless as ghosts, and on the alert like so many
 retrievers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jim's eyes, wandering in the intervals of his answers, rested upon a white
 man who sat apart from the others, with his face worn and clouded, but
 with quiet eyes that glanced straight, interested and clear. Jim answered
 another question and was tempted to cry out, 'What's the good of this!
 what's the good!' He tapped with his foot slightly, bit his lip, and
 looked away over the heads. He met the eyes of the white man. The glance
 directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others. It was an act
 of intelligent volition. Jim between two questions forgot himself so far
 as to find leisure for a thought. This fellow?ran the thought?looks
 at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder. He
 had come across that man before?in the street perhaps. He was
 positive he had never spoken to him. For days, for many days, he had
 spoken to no one, but had held silent, incoherent, and endless converse
 with himself, like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in
 a wilderness. At present he was answering questions that did not matter
 though they had a purpose, but he doubted whether he would ever again
 speak out as long as he lived. The sound of his own truthful statements
 confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any
 longer. That man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty. Jim
 looked at him, then turned away resolutely, as after a final parting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And later on, many times, in distant parts of the world, Marlow showed
 himself willing to remember Jim, to remember him at length, in detail and
 audibly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps it would be after dinner, on a verandah draped in motionless
 foliage and crowned with flowers, in the deep dusk speckled by fiery
 cigar-ends. The elongated bulk of each cane-chair harboured a silent
 listener. Now and then a small red glow would move abruptly, and expanding
 light up the fingers of a languid hand, part of a face in profound repose,
 or flash a crimson gleam into a pair of pensive eyes overshadowed by a
 fragment of an unruffled forehead; and with the very first word uttered
 Marlow's body, extended at rest in the seat, would become very still, as
 though his spirit had winged its way back into the lapse of time and were
 speaking through his lips from the past.

 CHAPTER 5
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Oh yes. I attended the inquiry,' he would say, 'and to this day I haven't
 left off wondering why I went. I am willing to believe each of us has a
 guardian angel, if you fellows will concede to me that each of us has a
 familiar devil as well. I want you to own up, because I don't like to feel
 exceptional in any way, and I know I have him?the devil, I mean. I
 haven't seen him, of course, but I go upon circumstantial evidence. He is
 there right enough, and, being malicious, he lets me in for that kind of
 thing. What kind of thing, you ask? Why, the inquiry thing, the yellow-dog
 thing?you wouldn't think a mangy, native tyke would be allowed to
 trip up people in the verandah of a magistrate's court, would you??the
 kind of thing that by devious, unexpected, truly diabolical ways causes me
 to run up against men with soft spots, with hard spots, with hidden plague
 spots, by Jove! and loosens their tongues at the sight of me for their
 infernal confidences; as though, forsooth, I had no confidences to make to
 myself, as though?God help me!?I didn't have enough
 confidential information about myself to harrow my own soul till the end
 of my appointed time. And what I have done to be thus favoured I want to
 know. I declare I am as full of my own concerns as the next man, and I
 have as much memory as the average pilgrim in this valley, so you see I am
 not particularly fit to be a receptacle of confessions. Then why? Can't
 tell?unless it be to make time pass away after dinner. Charley, my
 dear chap, your dinner was extremely good, and in consequence these men
 here look upon a quiet rubber as a tumultuous occupation. They wallow in
 your good chairs and think to themselves, "Hang exertion. Let that Marlow
 talk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Talk? So be it. And it's easy enough to talk of Master Jim, after a good
 spread, two hundred feet above the sea-level, with a box of decent cigars
 handy, on a blessed evening of freshness and starlight that would make the
 best of us forget we are only on sufferance here and got to pick our way
 in cross lights, watching every precious minute and every irremediable
 step, trusting we shall manage yet to go out decently in the end?but
 not so sure of it after all?and with dashed little help to expect
 from those we touch elbows with right and left. Of course there are men
 here and there to whom the whole of life is like an after-dinner hour with
 a cigar; easy, pleasant, empty, perhaps enlivened by some fable of strife
 to be forgotten before the end is told?before the end is told?even
 if there happens to be any end to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'My eyes met his for the first time at that inquiry. You must know that
 everybody connected in any way with the sea was there, because the affair
 had been notorious for days, ever since that mysterious cable message came
 from Aden to start us all cackling. I say mysterious, because it was so in
 a sense though it contained a naked fact, about as naked and ugly as a
 fact can well be. The whole waterside talked of nothing else. First thing
 in the morning as I was dressing in my state-room, I would hear through
 the bulkhead my Parsee Dubash jabbering about the Patna with the steward,
 while he drank a cup of tea, by favour, in the pantry. No sooner on shore
 I would meet some acquaintance, and the first remark would be, "Did you
 ever hear of anything to beat this?" and according to his kind the man
 would smile cynically, or look sad, or let out a swear or two. Complete
 strangers would accost each other familiarly, just for the sake of easing
 their minds on the subject: every confounded loafer in the town came in
 for a harvest of drinks over this affair: you heard of it in the harbour
 office, at every ship-broker's, at your agent's, from whites, from
 natives, from half-castes, from the very boatmen squatting half naked on
 the stone steps as you went up?by Jove! There was some indignation,
 not a few jokes, and no end of discussions as to what had become of them,
 you know. This went on for a couple of weeks or more, and the opinion that
 whatever was mysterious in this affair would turn out to be tragic as
 well, began to prevail, when one fine morning, as I was standing in the
 shade by the steps of the harbour office, I perceived four men walking
 towards me along the quay. I wondered for a while where that queer lot had
 sprung from, and suddenly, I may say, I shouted to myself, "Here they
 are!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There they were, sure enough, three of them as large as life, and one
 much larger of girth than any living man has a right to be, just landed
 with a good breakfast inside of them from an outward-bound Dale Line
 steamer that had come in about an hour after sunrise. There could be no
 mistake; I spotted the jolly skipper of the Patna at the first glance: the
 fattest man in the whole blessed tropical belt clear round that good old
 earth of ours. Moreover, nine months or so before, I had come across him
 in Samarang. His steamer was loading in the Roads, and he was abusing the
 tyrannical institutions of the German empire, and soaking himself in beer
 all day long and day after day in De Jongh's back-shop, till De Jongh, who
 charged a guilder for every bottle without as much as the quiver of an
 eyelid, would beckon me aside, and, with his little leathery face all
 puckered up, declare confidentially, "Business is business, but this man,
 captain, he make me very sick. Tfui!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was looking at him from the shade. He was hurrying on a little in
 advance, and the sunlight beating on him brought out his bulk in a
 startling way. He made me think of a trained baby elephant walking on
 hind-legs. He was extravagantly gorgeous too?got up in a soiled
 sleeping-suit, bright green and deep orange vertical stripes, with a pair
 of ragged straw slippers on his bare feet, and somebody's cast-off pith
 hat, very dirty and two sizes too small for him, tied up with a manilla
 rope-yarn on the top of his big head. You understand a man like that
 hasn't the ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes. Very
 well. On he came in hot haste, without a look right or left, passed within
 three feet of me, and in the innocence of his heart went on pelting
 upstairs into the harbour office to make his deposition, or report, or
 whatever you like to call it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It appears he addressed himself in the first instance to the principal
 shipping-master. Archie Ruthvel had just come in, and, as his story goes,
 was about to begin his arduous day by giving a dressing-down to his chief
 clerk. Some of you might have known him?an obliging little
 Portuguese half-caste with a miserably skinny neck, and always on the hop
 to get something from the shipmasters in the way of eatables?a piece
 of salt pork, a bag of biscuits, a few potatoes, or what not. One voyage,
 I recollect, I tipped him a live sheep out of the remnant of my sea-stock:
 not that I wanted him to do anything for me?he couldn't, you know?but
 because his childlike belief in the sacred right to perquisites quite
 touched my heart. It was so strong as to be almost beautiful. The race?the
 two races rather?and the climate . . . However, never mind. I know
 where I have a friend for life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Well, Ruthvel says he was giving him a severe lecture?on official
 morality, I suppose?when he heard a kind of subdued commotion at his
 back, and turning his head he saw, in his own words, something round and
 enormous, resembling a sixteen-hundred-weight sugar-hogshead wrapped in
 striped flannelette, up-ended in the middle of the large floor space in
 the office. He declares he was so taken aback that for quite an
 appreciable time he did not realise the thing was alive, and sat still
 wondering for what purpose and by what means that object had been
 transported in front of his desk. The archway from the ante-room was
 crowded with punkah-pullers, sweepers, police peons, the coxswain and crew
 of the harbour steam-launch, all craning their necks and almost climbing
 on each other's backs. Quite a riot. By that time the fellow had managed
 to tug and jerk his hat clear of his head, and advanced with slight bows
 at Ruthvel, who told me the sight was so discomposing that for some time
 he listened, quite unable to make out what that apparition wanted. It
 spoke in a voice harsh and lugubrious but intrepid, and little by little
 it dawned upon Archie that this was a development of the Patna case. He
 says that as soon as he understood who it was before him he felt quite
 unwell?Archie is so sympathetic and easily upset?but pulled
 himself together and shouted "Stop! I can't listen to you. You must go to
 the Master Attendant. I can't possibly listen to you. Captain Elliot is
 the man you want to see. This way, this way." He jumped up, ran round that
 long counter, pulled, shoved: the other let him, surprised but obedient at
 first, and only at the door of the private office some sort of animal
 instinct made him hang back and snort like a frightened bullock. "Look
 here! what's up? Let go! Look here!" Archie flung open the door without
 knocking. "The master of the Patna, sir," he shouts. "Go in, captain." He
 saw the old man lift his head from some writing so sharp that his
 nose-nippers fell off, banged the door to, and fled to his desk, where he
 had some papers waiting for his signature: but he says the row that burst
 out in there was so awful that he couldn't collect his senses sufficiently
 to remember the spelling of his own name. Archie's the most sensitive
 shipping-master in the two hemispheres. He declares he felt as though he
 had thrown a man to a hungry lion. No doubt the noise was great. I heard
 it down below, and I have every reason to believe it was heard clear
 across the Esplanade as far as the band-stand. Old father Elliot had a
 great stock of words and could shout?and didn't mind who he shouted
 at either. He would have shouted at the Viceroy himself. As he used to
 tell me: "I am as high as I can get; my pension is safe. I've a few pounds
 laid by, and if they don't like my notions of duty I would just as soon go
 home as not. I am an old man, and I have always spoken my mind. All I care
 for now is to see my girls married before I die." He was a little crazy on
 that point. His three daughters were awfully nice, though they resembled
 him amazingly, and on the mornings he woke up with a gloomy view of their
 matrimonial prospects the office would read it in his eye and tremble,
 because, they said, he was sure to have somebody for breakfast. However,
 that morning he did not eat the renegade, but, if I may be allowed to
 carry on the metaphor, chewed him up very small, so to speak, and?ah!
 ejected him again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus in a very few moments I saw his monstrous bulk descend in haste and
 stand still on the outer steps. He had stopped close to me for the purpose
 of profound meditation: his large purple cheeks quivered. He was biting
 his thumb, and after a while noticed me with a sidelong vexed look. The
 other three chaps that had landed with him made a little group waiting at
 some distance. There was a sallow-faced, mean little chap with his arm in
 a sling, and a long individual in a blue flannel coat, as dry as a chip
 and no stouter than a broomstick, with drooping grey moustaches, who
 looked about him with an air of jaunty imbecility. The third was an
 upstanding, broad-shouldered youth, with his hands in his pockets, turning
 his back on the other two who appeared to be talking together earnestly.
 He stared across the empty Esplanade. A ramshackle gharry, all dust and
 venetian blinds, pulled up short opposite the group, and the driver,
 throwing up his right foot over his knee, gave himself up to the critical
 examination of his toes. The young chap, making no movement, not even
 stirring his head, just stared into the sunshine. This was my first view
 of Jim. He looked as unconcerned and unapproachable as only the young can
 look. There he stood, clean-limbed, clean-faced, firm on his feet, as
 promising a boy as the sun ever shone on; and, looking at him, knowing all
 he knew and a little more too, I was as angry as though I had detected him
 trying to get something out of me by false pretences. He had no business
 to look so sound. I thought to myself?well, if this sort can go
 wrong like that . . . and I felt as though I could fling down my hat and
 dance on it from sheer mortification, as I once saw the skipper of an
 Italian barque do because his duffer of a mate got into a mess with his
 anchors when making a flying moor in a roadstead full of ships. I asked
 myself, seeing him there apparently so much at ease?is he silly? is
 he callous? He seemed ready to start whistling a tune. And note, I did not
 care a rap about the behaviour of the other two. Their persons somehow
 fitted the tale that was public property, and was going to be the subject
 of an official inquiry. "That old mad rogue upstairs called me a hound,"
 said the captain of the Patna. I can't tell whether he recognised me?I
 rather think he did; but at any rate our glances met. He glared?I
 smiled; hound was the very mildest epithet that had reached me through the
 open window. "Did he?" I said from some strange inability to hold my
 tongue. He nodded, bit his thumb again, swore under his breath: then
 lifting his head and looking at me with sullen and passionate impudence?"Bah!
 the Pacific is big, my friendt. You damned Englishmen can do your worst; I
 know where there's plenty room for a man like me: I am well aguaindt in
 Apia, in Honolulu, in . . ." He paused reflectively, while without effort
 I could depict to myself the sort of people he was "aguaindt" with in
 those places. I won't make a secret of it that I had been "aguaindt" with
 not a few of that sort myself. There are times when a man must act as
 though life were equally sweet in any company. I've known such a time,
 and, what's more, I shan't now pretend to pull a long face over my
 necessity, because a good many of that bad company from want of moral?moral?what
 shall I say??posture, or from some other equally profound cause,
 were twice as instructive and twenty times more amusing than the usual
 respectable thief of commerce you fellows ask to sit at your table without
 any real necessity?from habit, from cowardice, from good-nature,
 from a hundred sneaking and inadequate reasons.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You Englishmen are all rogues," went on my patriotic Flensborg or
 Stettin Australian. I really don't recollect now what decent little port
 on the shores of the Baltic was defiled by being the nest of that precious
 bird. "What are you to shout? Eh? You tell me? You no better than other
 people, and that old rogue he make Gottam fuss with me." His thick carcass
 trembled on its legs that were like a pair of pillars; it trembled from
 head to foot. "That's what you English always make?make a tam' fuss?for
 any little thing, because I was not born in your tam' country. Take away
 my certificate. Take it. I don't want the certificate. A man like me don't
 want your verfluchte certificate. I shpit on it." He spat. "I vill an
 Amerigan citizen begome," he cried, fretting and fuming and shuffling his
 feet as if to free his ankles from some invisible and mysterious grasp
 that would not let him get away from that spot. He made himself so warm
 that the top of his bullet head positively smoked. Nothing mysterious
 prevented me from going away: curiosity is the most obvious of sentiments,
 and it held me there to see the effect of a full information upon that
 young fellow who, hands in pockets, and turning his back upon the
 sidewalk, gazed across the grass-plots of the Esplanade at the yellow
 portico of the Malabar Hotel with the air of a man about to go for a walk
 as soon as his friend is ready. That's how he looked, and it was odious. I
 waited to see him overwhelmed, confounded, pierced through and through,
 squirming like an impaled beetle?and I was half afraid to see it too?if
 you understand what I mean. Nothing more awful than to watch a man who has
 been found out, not in a crime but in a more than criminal weakness. The
 commonest sort of fortitude prevents us from becoming criminals in a legal
 sense; it is from weakness unknown, but perhaps suspected, as in some
 parts of the world you suspect a deadly snake in every bush?from
 weakness that may lie hidden, watched or unwatched, prayed against or
 manfully scorned, repressed or maybe ignored more than half a lifetime,
 not one of us is safe. We are snared into doing things for which we get
 called names, and things for which we get hanged, and yet the spirit may
 well survive?survive the condemnation, survive the halter, by Jove!
 And there are things?they look small enough sometimes too?by
 which some of us are totally and completely undone. I watched the
 youngster there. I liked his appearance; I knew his appearance; he came
 from the right place; he was one of us. He stood there for all the
 parentage of his kind, for men and women by no means clever or amusing,
 but whose very existence is based upon honest faith, and upon the instinct
 of courage. I don't mean military courage, or civil courage, or any
 special kind of courage. I mean just that inborn ability to look
 temptations straight in the face?a readiness unintellectual enough,
 goodness knows, but without pose?a power of resistance, don't you
 see, ungracious if you like, but priceless?an unthinking and blessed
 stiffness before the outward and inward terrors, before the might of
 nature and the seductive corruption of men?backed by a faith
 invulnerable to the strength of facts, to the contagion of example, to the
 solicitation of ideas. Hang ideas! They are tramps, vagabonds, knocking at
 the back-door of your mind, each taking a little of your substance, each
 carrying away some crumb of that belief in a few simple notions you must
 cling to if you want to live decently and would like to die easy!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This has nothing to do with Jim, directly; only he was outwardly so
 typical of that good, stupid kind we like to feel marching right and left
 of us in life, of the kind that is not disturbed by the vagaries of
 intelligence and the perversions of?of nerves, let us say. He was
 the kind of fellow you would, on the strength of his looks, leave in
 charge of the deck?figuratively and professionally speaking. I say I
 would, and I ought to know. Haven't I turned out youngsters enough in my
 time, for the service of the Red Rag, to the craft of the sea, to the
 craft whose whole secret could be expressed in one short sentence, and yet
 must be driven afresh every day into young heads till it becomes the
 component part of every waking thought?till it is present in every
 dream of their young sleep! The sea has been good to me, but when I
 remember all these boys that passed through my hands, some grown up now
 and some drowned by this time, but all good stuff for the sea, I don't
 think I have done badly by it either. Were I to go home to-morrow, I bet
 that before two days passed over my head some sunburnt young chief mate
 would overtake me at some dock gateway or other, and a fresh deep voice
 speaking above my hat would ask: "Don't you remember me, sir? Why! little
 So-and-so. Such and such a ship. It was my first voyage." And I would
 remember a bewildered little shaver, no higher than the back of this
 chair, with a mother and perhaps a big sister on the quay, very quiet but
 too upset to wave their handkerchiefs at the ship that glides out gently
 between the pier-heads; or perhaps some decent middle-aged father who had
 come early with his boy to see him off, and stays all the morning, because
 he is interested in the windlass apparently, and stays too long, and has
 got to scramble ashore at last with no time at all to say good-bye. The
 mud pilot on the poop sings out to me in a drawl, "Hold her with the check
 line for a moment, Mister Mate. There's a gentleman wants to get ashore. .
 . . Up with you, sir. Nearly got carried off to Talcahuano, didn't you?
 Now's your time; easy does it. . . . All right. Slack away again forward
 there." The tugs, smoking like the pit of perdition, get hold and churn
 the old river into fury; the gentleman ashore is dusting his knees?the
 benevolent steward has shied his umbrella after him. All very proper. He
 has offered his bit of sacrifice to the sea, and now he may go home
 pretending he thinks nothing of it; and the little willing victim shall be
 very sea-sick before next morning. By-and-by, when he has learned all the
 little mysteries and the one great secret of the craft, he shall be fit to
 live or die as the sea may decree; and the man who had taken a hand in
 this fool game, in which the sea wins every toss, will be pleased to have
 his back slapped by a heavy young hand, and to hear a cheery sea-puppy
 voice: "Do you remember me, sir? The little So-and-so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I tell you this is good; it tells you that once in your life at least you
 had gone the right way to work. I have been thus slapped, and I have
 winced, for the slap was heavy, and I have glowed all day long and gone to
 bed feeling less lonely in the world by virtue of that hearty thump. Don't
 I remember the little So-and-so's! I tell you I ought to know the right
 kind of looks. I would have trusted the deck to that youngster on the
 strength of a single glance, and gone to sleep with both eyes?and,
 by Jove! it wouldn't have been safe. There are depths of horror in that
 thought. He looked as genuine as a new sovereign, but there was some
 infernal alloy in his metal. How much? The least thing?the least
 drop of something rare and accursed; the least drop!?but he made you?standing
 there with his don't-care-hang air?he made you wonder whether
 perchance he were nothing more rare than brass.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I couldn't believe it. I tell you I wanted to see him squirm for the
 honour of the craft. The other two no-account chaps spotted their captain,
 and began to move slowly towards us. They chatted together as they
 strolled, and I did not care any more than if they had not been visible to
 the naked eye. They grinned at each other?might have been exchanging
 jokes, for all I know. I saw that with one of them it was a case of a
 broken arm; and as to the long individual with grey moustaches he was the
 chief engineer, and in various ways a pretty notorious personality. They
 were nobodies. They approached. The skipper gazed in an inanimate way
 between his feet: he seemed to be swollen to an unnatural size by some
 awful disease, by the mysterious action of an unknown poison. He lifted
 his head, saw the two before him waiting, opened his mouth with an
 extraordinary, sneering contortion of his puffed face?to speak to
 them, I suppose?and then a thought seemed to strike him. His thick,
 purplish lips came together without a sound, he went off in a resolute
 waddle to the gharry and began to jerk at the door-handle with such a
 blind brutality of impatience that I expected to see the whole concern
 overturned on its side, pony and all. The driver, shaken out of his
 meditation over the sole of his foot, displayed at once all the signs of
 intense terror, and held with both hands, looking round from his box at
 this vast carcass forcing its way into his conveyance. The little machine
 shook and rocked tumultuously, and the crimson nape of that lowered neck,
 the size of those straining thighs, the immense heaving of that dingy,
 striped green-and-orange back, the whole burrowing effort of that gaudy
 and sordid mass, troubled one's sense of probability with a droll and
 fearsome effect, like one of those grotesque and distinct visions that
 scare and fascinate one in a fever. He disappeared. I half expected the
 roof to split in two, the little box on wheels to burst open in the manner
 of a ripe cotton-pod?but it only sank with a click of flattened
 springs, and suddenly one venetian blind rattled down. His shoulders
 reappeared, jammed in the small opening; his head hung out, distended and
 tossing like a captive balloon, perspiring, furious, spluttering. He
 reached for the gharry-wallah with vicious flourishes of a fist as dumpy
 and red as a lump of raw meat. He roared at him to be off, to go on.
 Where? Into the Pacific, perhaps. The driver lashed; the pony snorted,
 reared once, and darted off at a gallop. Where? To Apia? To Honolulu? He
 had 6000 miles of tropical belt to disport himself in, and I did not hear
 the precise address. A snorting pony snatched him into "Ewigkeit" in the
 twinkling of an eye, and I never saw him again; and, what's more, I don't
 know of anybody that ever had a glimpse of him after he departed from my
 knowledge sitting inside a ramshackle little gharry that fled round the
 corner in a white smother of dust. He departed, disappeared, vanished,
 absconded; and absurdly enough it looked as though he had taken that
 gharry with him, for never again did I come across a sorrel pony with a
 slit ear and a lackadaisical Tamil driver afflicted by a sore foot. The
 Pacific is indeed big; but whether he found a place for a display of his
 talents in it or not, the fact remains he had flown into space like a
 witch on a broomstick. The little chap with his arm in a sling started to
 run after the carriage, bleating, "Captain! I say, Captain! I sa-a-ay!"?but
 after a few steps stopped short, hung his head, and walked back slowly. At
 the sharp rattle of the wheels the young fellow spun round where he stood.
 He made no other movement, no gesture, no sign, and remained facing in the
 new direction after the gharry had swung out of sight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'All this happened in much less time than it takes to tell, since I am
 trying to interpret for you into slow speech the instantaneous effect of
 visual impressions. Next moment the half-caste clerk, sent by Archie to
 look a little after the poor castaways of the Patna, came upon the scene.
 He ran out eager and bareheaded, looking right and left, and very full of
 his mission. It was doomed to be a failure as far as the principal person
 was concerned, but he approached the others with fussy importance, and,
 almost immediately, found himself involved in a violent altercation with
 the chap that carried his arm in a sling, and who turned out to be
 extremely anxious for a row. He wasn't going to be ordered about?"not
 he, b'gosh." He wouldn't be terrified with a pack of lies by a cocky
 half-bred little quill-driver. He was not going to be bullied by "no
 object of that sort," if the story were true "ever so"! He bawled his
 wish, his desire, his determination to go to bed. "If you weren't a
 God-forsaken Portuguee," I heard him yell, "you would know that the
 hospital is the right place for me." He pushed the fist of his sound arm
 under the other's nose; a crowd began to collect; the half-caste,
 flustered, but doing his best to appear dignified, tried to explain his
 intentions. I went away without waiting to see the end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But it so happened that I had a man in the hospital at the time, and
 going there to see about him the day before the opening of the Inquiry, I
 saw in the white men's ward that little chap tossing on his back, with his
 arm in splints, and quite light-headed. To my great surprise the other
 one, the long individual with drooping white moustache, had also found his
 way there. I remembered I had seen him slinking away during the quarrel,
 in a half prance, half shuffle, and trying very hard not to look scared.
 He was no stranger to the port, it seems, and in his distress was able to
 make tracks straight for Mariani's billiard-room and grog-shop near the
 bazaar. That unspeakable vagabond, Mariani, who had known the man and had
 ministered to his vices in one or two other places, kissed the ground, in
 a manner of speaking, before him, and shut him up with a supply of bottles
 in an upstairs room of his infamous hovel. It appears he was under some
 hazy apprehension as to his personal safety, and wished to be concealed.
 However, Mariani told me a long time after (when he came on board one day
 to dun my steward for the price of some cigars) that he would have done
 more for him without asking any questions, from gratitude for some unholy
 favour received very many years ago?as far as I could make out. He
 thumped twice his brawny chest, rolled enormous black-and-white eyes
 glistening with tears: "Antonio never forget?Antonio never forget!"
 What was the precise nature of the immoral obligation I never learned, but
 be it what it may, he had every facility given him to remain under lock
 and key, with a chair, a table, a mattress in a corner, and a litter of
 fallen plaster on the floor, in an irrational state of funk, and keeping
 up his pecker with such tonics as Mariani dispensed. This lasted till the
 evening of the third day, when, after letting out a few horrible screams,
 he found himself compelled to seek safety in flight from a legion of
 centipedes. He burst the door open, made one leap for dear life down the
 crazy little stairway, landed bodily on Mariani's stomach, picked himself
 up, and bolted like a rabbit into the streets. The police plucked him off
 a garbage-heap in the early morning. At first he had a notion they were
 carrying him off to be hanged, and fought for liberty like a hero, but
 when I sat down by his bed he had been very quiet for two days. His lean
 bronzed head, with white moustaches, looked fine and calm on the pillow,
 like the head of a war-worn soldier with a child-like soul, had it not
 been for a hint of spectral alarm that lurked in the blank glitter of his
 glance, resembling a nondescript form of a terror crouching silently
 behind a pane of glass. He was so extremely calm, that I began to indulge
 in the eccentric hope of hearing something explanatory of the famous
 affair from his point of view. Why I longed to go grubbing into the
 deplorable details of an occurrence which, after all, concerned me no more
 than as a member of an obscure body of men held together by a community of
 inglorious toil and by fidelity to a certain standard of conduct, I can't
 explain. You may call it an unhealthy curiosity if you like; but I have a
 distinct notion I wished to find something. Perhaps, unconsciously, I
 hoped I would find that something, some profound and redeeming cause, some
 merciful explanation, some convincing shadow of an excuse. I see well
 enough now that I hoped for the impossible?for the laying of what is
 the most obstinate ghost of man's creation, of the uneasy doubt uprising
 like a mist, secret and gnawing like a worm, and more chilling than the
 certitude of death?the doubt of the sovereign power enthroned in a
 fixed standard of conduct. It is the hardest thing to stumble against; it
 is the thing that breeds yelling panics and good little quiet villainies;
 it's the true shadow of calamity. Did I believe in a miracle? and why did
 I desire it so ardently? Was it for my own sake that I wished to find some
 shadow of an excuse for that young fellow whom I had never seen before,
 but whose appearance alone added a touch of personal concern to the
 thoughts suggested by the knowledge of his weakness?made it a thing
 of mystery and terror?like a hint of a destructive fate ready for us
 all whose youth?in its day?had resembled his youth? I fear
 that such was the secret motive of my prying. I was, and no mistake,
 looking for a miracle. The only thing that at this distance of time
 strikes me as miraculous is the extent of my imbecility. I positively
 hoped to obtain from that battered and shady invalid some exorcism against
 the ghost of doubt. I must have been pretty desperate too, for, without
 loss of time, after a few indifferent and friendly sentences which he
 answered with languid readiness, just as any decent sick man would do, I
 produced the word Patna wrapped up in a delicate question as in a wisp of
 floss silk. I was delicate selfishly; I did not want to startle him; I had
 no solicitude for him; I was not furious with him and sorry for him: his
 experience was of no importance, his redemption would have had no point
 for me. He had grown old in minor iniquities, and could no longer inspire
 aversion or pity. He repeated Patna? interrogatively, seemed to make a
 short effort of memory, and said: "Quite right. I am an old stager out
 here. I saw her go down." I made ready to vent my indignation at such a
 stupid lie, when he added smoothly, "She was full of reptiles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This made me pause. What did he mean? The unsteady phantom of terror
 behind his glassy eyes seemed to stand still and look into mine wistfully.
 "They turned me out of my bunk in the middle watch to look at her
 sinking," he pursued in a reflective tone. His voice sounded alarmingly
 strong all at once. I was sorry for my folly. There was no snowy-winged
 coif of a nursing sister to be seen flitting in the perspective of the
 ward; but away in the middle of a long row of empty iron bedsteads an
 accident case from some ship in the Roads sat up brown and gaunt with a
 white bandage set rakishly on the forehead. Suddenly my interesting
 invalid shot out an arm thin like a tentacle and clawed my shoulder. "Only
 my eyes were good enough to see. I am famous for my eyesight. That's why
 they called me, I expect. None of them was quick enough to see her go, but
 they saw that she was gone right enough, and sang out together?like
 this." . . . A wolfish howl searched the very recesses of my soul. "Oh!
 make 'im dry up," whined the accident case irritably. "You don't believe
 me, I suppose," went on the other, with an air of ineffable conceit. "I
 tell you there are no such eyes as mine this side of the Persian Gulf.
 Look under the bed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Of course I stooped instantly. I defy anybody not to have done so. "What
 can you see?" he asked. "Nothing," I said, feeling awfully ashamed of
 myself. He scrutinised my face with wild and withering contempt. "Just
 so," he said, "but if I were to look I could see?there's no eyes
 like mine, I tell you." Again he clawed, pulling at me downwards in his
 eagerness to relieve himself by a confidential communication. "Millions of
 pink toads. There's no eyes like mine. Millions of pink toads. It's worse
 than seeing a ship sink. I could look at sinking ships and smoke my pipe
 all day long. Why don't they give me back my pipe? I would get a smoke
 while I watched these toads. The ship was full of them. They've got to be
 watched, you know." He winked facetiously. The perspiration dripped on him
 off my head, my drill coat clung to my wet back: the afternoon breeze
 swept impetuously over the row of bedsteads, the stiff folds of curtains
 stirred perpendicularly, rattling on brass rods, the covers of empty beds
 blew about noiselessly near the bare floor all along the line, and I
 shivered to the very marrow. The soft wind of the tropics played in that
 naked ward as bleak as a winter's gale in an old barn at home. "Don't you
 let him start his hollering, mister," hailed from afar the accident case
 in a distressed angry shout that came ringing between the walls like a
 quavering call down a tunnel. The clawing hand hauled at my shoulder; he
 leered at me knowingly. "The ship was full of them, you know, and we had
 to clear out on the strict Q.T.," he whispered with extreme rapidity. "All
 pink. All pink?as big as mastiffs, with an eye on the top of the
 head and claws all round their ugly mouths. Ough! Ough!" Quick jerks as of
 galvanic shocks disclosed under the flat coverlet the outlines of meagre
 and agitated legs; he let go my shoulder and reached after something in
 the air; his body trembled tensely like a released harp-string; and while
 I looked down, the spectral horror in him broke through his glassy gaze.
 Instantly his face of an old soldier, with its noble and calm outlines,
 became decomposed before my eyes by the corruption of stealthy cunning, of
 an abominable caution and of desperate fear. He restrained a cry?"Ssh!
 what are they doing now down there?" he asked, pointing to the floor with
 fantastic precautions of voice and gesture, whose meaning, borne upon my
 mind in a lurid flash, made me very sick of my cleverness. "They are all
 asleep," I answered, watching him narrowly. That was it. That's what he
 wanted to hear; these were the exact words that could calm him. He drew a
 long breath. "Ssh! Quiet, steady. I am an old stager out here. I know them
 brutes. Bash in the head of the first that stirs. There's too many of
 them, and she won't swim more than ten minutes." He panted again. "Hurry
 up," he yelled suddenly, and went on in a steady scream: "They are all
 awake?millions of them. They are trampling on me! Wait! Oh, wait!
 I'll smash them in heaps like flies. Wait for me! Help! H-e-elp!" An
 interminable and sustained howl completed my discomfiture. I saw in the
 distance the accident case raise deplorably both his hands to his bandaged
 head; a dresser, aproned to the chin showed himself in the vista of the
 ward, as if seen in the small end of a telescope. I confessed myself
 fairly routed, and without more ado, stepping out through one of the long
 windows, escaped into the outside gallery. The howl pursued me like a
 vengeance. I turned into a deserted landing, and suddenly all became very
 still and quiet around me, and I descended the bare and shiny staircase in
 a silence that enabled me to compose my distracted thoughts. Down below I
 met one of the resident surgeons who was crossing the courtyard and
 stopped me. "Been to see your man, Captain? I think we may let him go
 to-morrow. These fools have no notion of taking care of themselves,
 though. I say, we've got the chief engineer of that pilgrim ship here. A
 curious case. D.T.'s of the worst kind. He has been drinking hard in that
 Greek's or Italian's grog-shop for three days. What can you expect? Four
 bottles of that kind of brandy a day, I am told. Wonderful, if true.
 Sheeted with boiler-iron inside I should think. The head, ah! the head, of
 course, gone, but the curious part is there's some sort of method in his
 raving. I am trying to find out. Most unusual?that thread of logic
 in such a delirium. Traditionally he ought to see snakes, but he doesn't.
 Good old tradition's at a discount nowadays. Eh! His?er?visions
 are batrachian. Ha! ha! No, seriously, I never remember being so
 interested in a case of jim-jams before. He ought to be dead, don't you
 know, after such a festive experiment. Oh! he is a tough object.
 Four-and-twenty years of the tropics too. You ought really to take a peep
 at him. Noble-looking old boozer. Most extraordinary man I ever met?medically,
 of course. Won't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I have been all along exhibiting the usual polite signs of interest, but
 now assuming an air of regret I murmured of want of time, and shook hands
 in a hurry. "I say," he cried after me; "he can't attend that inquiry. Is
 his evidence material, you think?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Not in the least," I called back from the gateway.'

 CHAPTER 6
 </h2>
 <p>
 'The authorities were evidently of the same opinion. The inquiry was not
 adjourned. It was held on the appointed day to satisfy the law, and it was
 well attended because of its human interest, no doubt. There was no
 incertitude as to facts?as to the one material fact, I mean. How the
 Patna came by her hurt it was impossible to find out; the court did not
 expect to find out; and in the whole audience there was not a man who
 cared. Yet, as I've told you, all the sailors in the port attended, and
 the waterside business was fully represented. Whether they knew it or not,
 the interest that drew them here was purely psychological?the
 expectation of some essential disclosure as to the strength, the power,
 the horror, of human emotions. Naturally nothing of the kind could be
 disclosed. The examination of the only man able and willing to face it was
 beating futilely round the well-known fact, and the play of questions upon
 it was as instructive as the tapping with a hammer on an iron box, were
 the object to find out what's inside. However, an official inquiry could
 not be any other thing. Its object was not the fundamental why, but the
 superficial how, of this affair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The young chap could have told them, and, though that very thing was the
 thing that interested the audience, the questions put to him necessarily
 led him away from what to me, for instance, would have been the only truth
 worth knowing. You can't expect the constituted authorities to inquire
 into the state of a man's soul?or is it only of his liver? Their
 business was to come down upon the consequences, and frankly, a casual
 police magistrate and two nautical assessors are not much good for
 anything else. I don't mean to imply these fellows were stupid. The
 magistrate was very patient. One of the assessors was a sailing-ship
 skipper with a reddish beard, and of a pious disposition. Brierly was the
 other. Big Brierly. Some of you must have heard of Big Brierly?the
 captain of the crack ship of the Blue Star line. That's the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He seemed consumedly bored by the honour thrust upon him. He had never in
 his life made a mistake, never had an accident, never a mishap, never a
 check in his steady rise, and he seemed to be one of those lucky fellows
 who know nothing of indecision, much less of self-mistrust. At thirty-two
 he had one of the best commands going in the Eastern trade?and,
 what's more, he thought a lot of what he had. There was nothing like it in
 the world, and I suppose if you had asked him point-blank he would have
 confessed that in his opinion there was not such another commander. The
 choice had fallen upon the right man. The rest of mankind that did not
 command the sixteen-knot steel steamer Ossa were rather poor creatures. He
 had saved lives at sea, had rescued ships in distress, had a gold
 chronometer presented to him by the underwriters, and a pair of binoculars
 with a suitable inscription from some foreign Government, in commemoration
 of these services. He was acutely aware of his merits and of his rewards.
 I liked him well enough, though some I know?meek, friendly men at
 that?couldn't stand him at any price. I haven't the slightest doubt
 he considered himself vastly my superior?indeed, had you been
 Emperor of East and West, you could not have ignored your inferiority in
 his presence?but I couldn't get up any real sentiment of offence. He
 did not despise me for anything I could help, for anything I was?don't
 you know? I was a negligible quantity simply because I was not <i>the</i>
 fortunate man of the earth, not Montague Brierly in command of the Ossa,
 not the owner of an inscribed gold chronometer and of silver-mounted
 binoculars testifying to the excellence of my seamanship and to my
 indomitable pluck; not possessed of an acute sense of my merits and of my
 rewards, besides the love and worship of a black retriever, the most
 wonderful of its kind?for never was such a man loved thus by such a
 dog. No doubt, to have all this forced upon you was exasperating enough;
 but when I reflected that I was associated in these fatal disadvantages
 with twelve hundred millions of other more or less human beings, I found I
 could bear my share of his good-natured and contemptuous pity for the sake
 of something indefinite and attractive in the man. I have never defined to
 myself this attraction, but there were moments when I envied him. The
 sting of life could do no more to his complacent soul than the scratch of
 a pin to the smooth face of a rock. This was enviable. As I looked at him,
 flanking on one side the unassuming pale-faced magistrate who presided at
 the inquiry, his self-satisfaction presented to me and to the world a
 surface as hard as granite. He committed suicide very soon after.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'No wonder Jim's case bored him, and while I thought with something akin
 to fear of the immensity of his contempt for the young man under
 examination, he was probably holding silent inquiry into his own case. The
 verdict must have been of unmitigated guilt, and he took the secret of the
 evidence with him in that leap into the sea. If I understand anything of
 men, the matter was no doubt of the gravest import, one of those trifles
 that awaken ideas?start into life some thought with which a man
 unused to such a companionship finds it impossible to live. I am in a
 position to know that it wasn't money, and it wasn't drink, and it wasn't
 woman. He jumped overboard at sea barely a week after the end of the
 inquiry, and less than three days after leaving port on his outward
 passage; as though on that exact spot in the midst of waters he had
 suddenly perceived the gates of the other world flung open wide for his
 reception.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Yet it was not a sudden impulse. His grey-headed mate, a first-rate
 sailor and a nice old chap with strangers, but in his relations with his
 commander the surliest chief officer I've ever seen, would tell the story
 with tears in his eyes. It appears that when he came on deck in the
 morning Brierly had been writing in the chart-room. "It was ten minutes to
 four," he said, "and the middle watch was not relieved yet of course. He
 heard my voice on the bridge speaking to the second mate, and called me
 in. I was loth to go, and that's the truth, Captain Marlow?I
 couldn't stand poor Captain Brierly, I tell you with shame; we never know
 what a man is made of. He had been promoted over too many heads, not
 counting my own, and he had a damnable trick of making you feel small,
 nothing but by the way he said 'Good morning.' I never addressed him, sir,
 but on matters of duty, and then it was as much as I could do to keep a
 civil tongue in my head." (He flattered himself there. I often wondered
 how Brierly could put up with his manners for more than half a voyage.)
 "I've a wife and children," he went on, "and I had been ten years in the
 Company, always expecting the next command?more fool I. Says he,
 just like this: 'Come in here, Mr. Jones,' in that swagger voice of his?'Come
 in here, Mr. Jones.' In I went. 'We'll lay down her position,' says he,
 stooping over the chart, a pair of dividers in hand. By the standing
 orders, the officer going off duty would have done that at the end of his
 watch. However, I said nothing, and looked on while he marked off the
 ship's position with a tiny cross and wrote the date and the time. I can
 see him this moment writing his neat figures: seventeen, eight, four A.M.
 The year would be written in red ink at the top of the chart. He never
 used his charts more than a year, Captain Brierly didn't. I've the chart
 now. When he had done he stands looking down at the mark he had made and
 smiling to himself, then looks up at me. 'Thirty-two miles more as she
 goes,' says he, 'and then we shall be clear, and you may alter the course
 twenty degrees to the southward.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"We were passing to the north of the Hector Bank that voyage. I said,
 'All right, sir,' wondering what he was fussing about, since I had to call
 him before altering the course anyhow. Just then eight bells were struck:
 we came out on the bridge, and the second mate before going off mentions
 in the usual way?'Seventy-one on the log.' Captain Brierly looks at
 the compass and then all round. It was dark and clear, and all the stars
 were out as plain as on a frosty night in high latitudes. Suddenly he says
 with a sort of a little sigh: 'I am going aft, and shall set the log at
 zero for you myself, so that there can be no mistake. Thirty-two miles
 more on this course and then you are safe. Let's see?the correction
 on the log is six per cent. additive; say, then, thirty by the dial to
 run, and you may come twenty degrees to starboard at once. No use losing
 any distance?is there?' I had never heard him talk so much at a
 stretch, and to no purpose as it seemed to me. I said nothing. He went
 down the ladder, and the dog, that was always at his heels whenever he
 moved, night or day, followed, sliding nose first, after him. I heard his
 boot-heels tap, tap on the after-deck, then he stopped and spoke to the
 dog?'Go back, Rover. On the bridge, boy! Go on?get.' Then he
 calls out to me from the dark, 'Shut that dog up in the chart-room, Mr.
 Jones?will you?'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"This was the last time I heard his voice, Captain Marlow. These are the
 last words he spoke in the hearing of any living human being, sir." At
 this point the old chap's voice got quite unsteady. "He was afraid the
 poor brute would jump after him, don't you see?" he pursued with a quaver.
 "Yes, Captain Marlow. He set the log for me; he?would you believe
 it??he put a drop of oil in it too. There was the oil-feeder where
 he left it near by. The boat-swain's mate got the hose along aft to wash
 down at half-past five; by-and-by he knocks off and runs up on the bridge?'Will
 you please come aft, Mr. Jones,' he says. 'There's a funny thing. I don't
 like to touch it.' It was Captain Brierly's gold chronometer watch
 carefully hung under the rail by its chain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"As soon as my eyes fell on it something struck me, and I knew, sir. My
 legs got soft under me. It was as if I had seen him go over; and I could
 tell how far behind he was left too. The taffrail-log marked eighteen
 miles and three-quarters, and four iron belaying-pins were missing round
 the mainmast. Put them in his pockets to help him down, I suppose; but,
 Lord! what's four iron pins to a powerful man like Captain Brierly. Maybe
 his confidence in himself was just shook a bit at the last. That's the
 only sign of fluster he gave in his whole life, I should think; but I am
 ready to answer for him, that once over he did not try to swim a stroke,
 the same as he would have had pluck enough to keep up all day long on the
 bare chance had he fallen overboard accidentally. Yes, sir. He was second
 to none?if he said so himself, as I heard him once. He had written
 two letters in the middle watch, one to the Company and the other to me.
 He gave me a lot of instructions as to the passage?I had been in the
 trade before he was out of his time?and no end of hints as to my
 conduct with our people in Shanghai, so that I should keep the command of
 the Ossa. He wrote like a father would to a favourite son, Captain Marlow,
 and I was five-and-twenty years his senior and had tasted salt water
 before he was fairly breeched. In his letter to the owners?it was
 left open for me to see?he said that he had always done his duty by
 them?up to that moment?and even now he was not betraying their
 confidence, since he was leaving the ship to as competent a seaman as
 could be found?meaning me, sir, meaning me! He told them that if the
 last act of his life didn't take away all his credit with them, they would
 give weight to my faithful service and to his warm recommendation, when
 about to fill the vacancy made by his death. And much more like this, sir.
 I couldn't believe my eyes. It made me feel queer all over," went on the
 old chap, in great perturbation, and squashing something in the corner of
 his eye with the end of a thumb as broad as a spatula. "You would think,
 sir, he had jumped overboard only to give an unlucky man a last show to
 get on. What with the shock of him going in this awful rash way, and
 thinking myself a made man by that chance, I was nearly off my chump for a
 week. But no fear. The captain of the Pelion was shifted into the Ossa?came
 aboard in Shanghai?a little popinjay, sir, in a grey check suit,
 with his hair parted in the middle. 'Aw?I am?aw?your new
 captain, Mister?Mister?aw?Jones.' He was drowned in
 scent?fairly stunk with it, Captain Marlow. I dare say it was the
 look I gave him that made him stammer. He mumbled something about my
 natural disappointment?I had better know at once that his chief
 officer got the promotion to the Pelion?he had nothing to do with
 it, of course?supposed the office knew best?sorry. . . . Says
 I, 'Don't you mind old Jones, sir; dam' his soul, he's used to it.' I
 could see directly I had shocked his delicate ear, and while we sat at our
 first tiffin together he began to find fault in a nasty manner with this
 and that in the ship. I never heard such a voice out of a Punch and Judy
 show. I set my teeth hard, and glued my eyes to my plate, and held my
 peace as long as I could; but at last I had to say something. Up he jumps
 tiptoeing, ruffling all his pretty plumes, like a little fighting-cock.
 'You'll find you have a different person to deal with than the late
 Captain Brierly.' 'I've found it,' says I, very glum, but pretending to be
 mighty busy with my steak. 'You are an old ruffian, Mister?aw?Jones;
 and what's more, you are known for an old ruffian in the employ,' he
 squeaks at me. The damned bottle-washers stood about listening with their
 mouths stretched from ear to ear. 'I may be a hard case,' answers I, 'but
 I ain't so far gone as to put up with the sight of you sitting in Captain
 Brierly's chair.' With that I lay down my knife and fork. 'You would like
 to sit in it yourself?that's where the shoe pinches,' he sneers. I
 left the saloon, got my rags together, and was on the quay with all my
 dunnage about my feet before the stevedores had turned to again. Yes.
 Adrift?on shore?after ten years' service?and with a poor
 woman and four children six thousand miles off depending on my half-pay
 for every mouthful they ate. Yes, sir! I chucked it rather than hear
 Captain Brierly abused. He left me his night-glasses?here they are;
 and he wished me to take care of the dog?here he is. Hallo, Rover,
 poor boy. Where's the captain, Rover?" The dog looked up at us with
 mournful yellow eyes, gave one desolate bark, and crept under the table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'All this was taking place, more than two years afterwards, on board that
 nautical ruin the Fire-Queen this Jones had got charge of?quite by a
 funny accident, too?from Matherson?mad Matherson they
 generally called him?the same who used to hang out in Hai-phong, you
 know, before the occupation days. The old chap snuffled on?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Ay, sir, Captain Brierly will be remembered here, if there's no other
 place on earth. I wrote fully to his father and did not get a word in
 reply?neither Thank you, nor Go to the devil!?nothing! Perhaps
 they did not want to know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The sight of that watery-eyed old Jones mopping his bald head with a red
 cotton handkerchief, the sorrowing yelp of the dog, the squalor of that
 fly-blown cuddy which was the only shrine of his memory, threw a veil of
 inexpressibly mean pathos over Brierly's remembered figure, the posthumous
 revenge of fate for that belief in his own splendour which had almost
 cheated his life of its legitimate terrors. Almost! Perhaps wholly. Who
 can tell what flattering view he had induced himself to take of his own
 suicide?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Why did he commit the rash act, Captain Marlow?can you think?"
 asked Jones, pressing his palms together. "Why? It beats me! Why?" He
 slapped his low and wrinkled forehead. "If he had been poor and old and in
 debt?and never a show?or else mad. But he wasn't of the kind
 that goes mad, not he. You trust me. What a mate don't know about his
 skipper isn't worth knowing. Young, healthy, well off, no cares. . . . I
 sit here sometimes thinking, thinking, till my head fairly begins to buzz.
 There was some reason."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You may depend on it, Captain Jones," said I, "it wasn't anything that
 would have disturbed much either of us two," I said; and then, as if a
 light had been flashed into the muddle of his brain, poor old Jones found
 a last word of amazing profundity. He blew his nose, nodding at me
 dolefully: "Ay, ay! neither you nor I, sir, had ever thought so much of
 ourselves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Of course the recollection of my last conversation with Brierly is tinged
 with the knowledge of his end that followed so close upon it. I spoke with
 him for the last time during the progress of the inquiry. It was after the
 first adjournment, and he came up with me in the street. He was in a state
 of irritation, which I noticed with surprise, his usual behaviour when he
 condescended to converse being perfectly cool, with a trace of amused
 tolerance, as if the existence of his interlocutor had been a rather good
 joke. "They caught me for that inquiry, you see," he began, and for a
 while enlarged complainingly upon the inconveniences of daily attendance
 in court. "And goodness knows how long it will last. Three days, I
 suppose." I heard him out in silence; in my then opinion it was a way as
 good as another of putting on side. "What's the use of it? It is the
 stupidest set-out you can imagine," he pursued hotly. I remarked that
 there was no option. He interrupted me with a sort of pent-up violence. "I
 feel like a fool all the time." I looked up at him. This was going very
 far?for Brierly?when talking of Brierly. He stopped short, and
 seizing the lapel of my coat, gave it a slight tug. "Why are we tormenting
 that young chap?" he asked. This question chimed in so well to the tolling
 of a certain thought of mine that, with the image of the absconding
 renegade in my eye, I answered at once, "Hanged if I know, unless it be
 that he lets you." I was astonished to see him fall into line, so to
 speak, with that utterance, which ought to have been tolerably cryptic. He
 said angrily, "Why, yes. Can't he see that wretched skipper of his has
 cleared out? What does he expect to happen? Nothing can save him. He's
 done for." We walked on in silence a few steps. "Why eat all that dirt?"
 he exclaimed, with an oriental energy of expression?about the only
 sort of energy you can find a trace of east of the fiftieth meridian. I
 wondered greatly at the direction of his thoughts, but now I strongly
 suspect it was strictly in character: at bottom poor Brierly must have
 been thinking of himself. I pointed out to him that the skipper of the
 Patna was known to have feathered his nest pretty well, and could procure
 almost anywhere the means of getting away. With Jim it was otherwise: the
 Government was keeping him in the Sailors' Home for the time being, and
 probably he hadn't a penny in his pocket to bless himself with. It costs
 some money to run away. "Does it? Not always," he said, with a bitter
 laugh, and to some further remark of mine?"Well, then, let him creep
 twenty feet underground and stay there! By heavens! <i>I</i> would." I
 don't know why his tone provoked me, and I said, "There is a kind of
 courage in facing it out as he does, knowing very well that if he went
 away nobody would trouble to run after him." "Courage be hanged!" growled
 Brierly. "That sort of courage is of no use to keep a man straight, and I
 don't care a snap for such courage. If you were to say it was a kind of
 cowardice now?of softness. I tell you what, I will put up two
 hundred rupees if you put up another hundred and undertake to make the
 beggar clear out early to-morrow morning. The fellow's a gentleman if he
 ain't fit to be touched?he will understand. He must! This infernal
 publicity is too shocking: there he sits while all these confounded
 natives, serangs, lascars, quartermasters, are giving evidence that's
 enough to burn a man to ashes with shame. This is abominable. Why, Marlow,
 don't you think, don't you feel, that this is abominable; don't you now?come?as
 a seaman? If he went away all this would stop at once." Brierly said these
 words with a most unusual animation, and made as if to reach after his
 pocket-book. I restrained him, and declared coldly that the cowardice of
 these four men did not seem to me a matter of such great importance. "And
 you call yourself a seaman, I suppose," he pronounced angrily. I said
 that's what I called myself, and I hoped I was too. He heard me out, and
 made a gesture with his big arm that seemed to deprive me of my
 individuality, to push me away into the crowd. "The worst of it," he said,
 "is that all you fellows have no sense of dignity; you don't think enough
 of what you are supposed to be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'We had been walking slowly meantime, and now stopped opposite the harbour
 office, in sight of the very spot from which the immense captain of the
 Patna had vanished as utterly as a tiny feather blown away in a hurricane.
 I smiled. Brierly went on: "This is a disgrace. We've got all kinds
 amongst us?some anointed scoundrels in the lot; but, hang it, we
 must preserve professional decency or we become no better than so many
 tinkers going about loose. We are trusted. Do you understand??trusted!
 Frankly, I don't care a snap for all the pilgrims that ever came out of
 Asia, but a decent man would not have behaved like this to a full cargo of
 old rags in bales. We aren't an organised body of men, and the only thing
 that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency. Such an
 affair destroys one's confidence. A man may go pretty near through his
 whole sea-life without any call to show a stiff upper lip. But when the
 call comes . . . Aha! . . . If I . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He broke off, and in a changed tone, "I'll give you two hundred rupees
 now, Marlow, and you just talk to that chap. Confound him! I wish he had
 never come out here. Fact is, I rather think some of my people know his.
 The old man's a parson, and I remember now I met him once when staying
 with my cousin in Essex last year. If I am not mistaken, the old chap
 seemed rather to fancy his sailor son. Horrible. I can't do it myself?but
 you . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus, apropos of Jim, I had a glimpse of the real Brierly a few days
 before he committed his reality and his sham together to the keeping of
 the sea. Of course I declined to meddle. The tone of this last "but you"
 (poor Brierly couldn't help it), that seemed to imply I was no more
 noticeable than an insect, caused me to look at the proposal with
 indignation, and on account of that provocation, or for some other reason,
 I became positive in my mind that the inquiry was a severe punishment to
 that Jim, and that his facing it?practically of his own free will?was
 a redeeming feature in his abominable case. I hadn't been so sure of it
 before. Brierly went off in a huff. At the time his state of mind was more
 of a mystery to me than it is now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Next day, coming into court late, I sat by myself. Of course I could not
 forget the conversation I had with Brierly, and now I had them both under
 my eyes. The demeanour of one suggested gloomy impudence and of the other
 a contemptuous boredom; yet one attitude might not have been truer than
 the other, and I was aware that one was not true. Brierly was not bored?he
 was exasperated; and if so, then Jim might not have been impudent.
 According to my theory he was not. I imagined he was hopeless. Then it was
 that our glances met. They met, and the look he gave me was discouraging
 of any intention I might have had to speak to him. Upon either hypothesis?insolence
 or despair?I felt I could be of no use to him. This was the second
 day of the proceedings. Very soon after that exchange of glances the
 inquiry was adjourned again to the next day. The white men began to troop
 out at once. Jim had been told to stand down some time before, and was
 able to leave amongst the first. I saw his broad shoulders and his head
 outlined in the light of the door, and while I made my way slowly out
 talking with some one?some stranger who had addressed me casually?I
 could see him from within the court-room resting both elbows on the
 balustrade of the verandah and turning his back on the small stream of
 people trickling down the few steps. There was a murmur of voices and a
 shuffle of boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The next case was that of assault and battery committed upon a
 money-lender, I believe; and the defendant?a venerable villager with
 a straight white beard?sat on a mat just outside the door with his
 sons, daughters, sons-in-law, their wives, and, I should think, half the
 population of his village besides, squatting or standing around him. A
 slim dark woman, with part of her back and one black shoulder bared, and
 with a thin gold ring in her nose, suddenly began to talk in a
 high-pitched, shrewish tone. The man with me instinctively looked up at
 her. We were then just through the door, passing behind Jim's burly back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Whether those villagers had brought the yellow dog with them, I don't
 know. Anyhow, a dog was there, weaving himself in and out amongst people's
 legs in that mute stealthy way native dogs have, and my companion stumbled
 over him. The dog leaped away without a sound; the man, raising his voice
 a little, said with a slow laugh, "Look at that wretched cur," and
 directly afterwards we became separated by a lot of people pushing in. I
 stood back for a moment against the wall while the stranger managed to get
 down the steps and disappeared. I saw Jim spin round. He made a step
 forward and barred my way. We were alone; he glared at me with an air of
 stubborn resolution. I became aware I was being held up, so to speak, as
 if in a wood. The verandah was empty by then, the noise and movement in
 court had ceased: a great silence fell upon the building, in which,
 somewhere far within, an oriental voice began to whine abjectly. The dog,
 in the very act of trying to sneak in at the door, sat down hurriedly to
 hunt for fleas.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Did you speak to me?" asked Jim very low, and bending forward, not so
 much towards me but at me, if you know what I mean. I said "No" at once.
 Something in the sound of that quiet tone of his warned me to be on my
 defence. I watched him. It was very much like a meeting in a wood, only
 more uncertain in its issue, since he could possibly want neither my money
 nor my life?nothing that I could simply give up or defend with a
 clear conscience. "You say you didn't," he said, very sombre. "But I
 heard." "Some mistake," I protested, utterly at a loss, and never taking
 my eyes off him. To watch his face was like watching a darkening sky
 before a clap of thunder, shade upon shade imperceptibly coming on, the
 doom growing mysteriously intense in the calm of maturing violence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"As far as I know, I haven't opened my lips in your hearing," I affirmed
 with perfect truth. I was getting a little angry, too, at the absurdity of
 this encounter. It strikes me now I have never in my life been so near a
 beating?I mean it literally; a beating with fists. I suppose I had
 some hazy prescience of that eventuality being in the air. Not that he was
 actively threatening me. On the contrary, he was strangely passive?don't
 you know? but he was lowering, and, though not exceptionally big, he
 looked generally fit to demolish a wall. The most reassuring symptom I
 noticed was a kind of slow and ponderous hesitation, which I took as a
 tribute to the evident sincerity of my manner and of my tone. We faced
 each other. In the court the assault case was proceeding. I caught the
 words: "Well?buffalo?stick?in the greatness of my fear.
 . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What did you mean by staring at me all the morning?" said Jim at last.
 He looked up and looked down again. "Did you expect us all to sit with
 downcast eyes out of regard for your susceptibilities?" I retorted
 sharply. I was not going to submit meekly to any of his nonsense. He
 raised his eyes again, and this time continued to look me straight in the
 face. "No. That's all right," he pronounced with an air of deliberating
 with himself upon the truth of this statement?"that's all right. I
 am going through with that. Only"?and there he spoke a little faster?"I
 won't let any man call me names outside this court. There was a fellow
 with you. You spoke to him?oh yes?I know; 'tis all very fine.
 You spoke to him, but you meant me to hear. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I assured him he was under some extraordinary delusion. I had no
 conception how it came about. "You thought I would be afraid to resent
 this," he said, with just a faint tinge of bitterness. I was interested
 enough to discern the slightest shades of expression, but I was not in the
 least enlightened; yet I don't know what in these words, or perhaps just
 the intonation of that phrase, induced me suddenly to make all possible
 allowances for him. I ceased to be annoyed at my unexpected predicament.
 It was some mistake on his part; he was blundering, and I had an intuition
 that the blunder was of an odious, of an unfortunate nature. I was anxious
 to end this scene on grounds of decency, just as one is anxious to cut
 short some unprovoked and abominable confidence. The funniest part was,
 that in the midst of all these considerations of the higher order I was
 conscious of a certain trepidation as to the possibility?nay,
 likelihood?of this encounter ending in some disreputable brawl which
 could not possibly be explained, and would make me ridiculous. I did not
 hanker after a three days' celebrity as the man who got a black eye or
 something of the sort from the mate of the Patna. He, in all probability,
 did not care what he did, or at any rate would be fully justified in his
 own eyes. It took no magician to see he was amazingly angry about
 something, for all his quiet and even torpid demeanour. I don't deny I was
 extremely desirous to pacify him at all costs, had I only known what to
 do. But I didn't know, as you may well imagine. It was a blackness without
 a single gleam. We confronted each other in silence. He hung fire for
 about fifteen seconds, then made a step nearer, and I made ready to ward
 off a blow, though I don't think I moved a muscle. "If you were as big as
 two men and as strong as six," he said very softly, "I would tell you what
 I think of you. You . . ." "Stop!" I exclaimed. This checked him for a
 second. "Before you tell me what you think of me," I went on quickly,
 "will you kindly tell me what it is I've said or done?" During the pause
 that ensued he surveyed me with indignation, while I made supernatural
 efforts of memory, in which I was hindered by the oriental voice within
 the court-room expostulating with impassioned volubility against a charge
 of falsehood. Then we spoke almost together. "I will soon show you I am
 not," he said, in a tone suggestive of a crisis. "I declare I don't know,"
 I protested earnestly at the same time. He tried to crush me by the scorn
 of his glance. "Now that you see I am not afraid you try to crawl out of
 it," he said. "Who's a cur now?hey?" Then, at last, I understood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He had been scanning my features as though looking for a place where he
 would plant his fist. "I will allow no man," . . . he mumbled
 threateningly. It was, indeed, a hideous mistake; he had given himself
 away utterly. I can't give you an idea how shocked I was. I suppose he saw
 some reflection of my feelings in my face, because his expression changed
 just a little. "Good God!" I stammered, "you don't think I . . ." "But I
 am sure I've heard," he persisted, raising his voice for the first time
 since the beginning of this deplorable scene. Then with a shade of disdain
 he added, "It wasn't you, then? Very well; I'll find the other." "Don't be
 a fool," I cried in exasperation; "it wasn't that at all." "I've heard,"
 he said again with an unshaken and sombre perseverance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There may be those who could have laughed at his pertinacity; I didn't.
 Oh, I didn't! There had never been a man so mercilessly shown up by his
 own natural impulse. A single word had stripped him of his discretion?of
 that discretion which is more necessary to the decencies of our inner
 being than clothing is to the decorum of our body. "Don't be a fool," I
 repeated. "But the other man said it, you don't deny that?" he pronounced
 distinctly, and looking in my face without flinching. "No, I don't deny,"
 said I, returning his gaze. At last his eyes followed downwards the
 direction of my pointing finger. He appeared at first uncomprehending,
 then confounded, and at last amazed and scared as though a dog had been a
 monster and he had never seen a dog before. "Nobody dreamt of insulting
 you," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He contemplated the wretched animal, that moved no more than an effigy:
 it sat with ears pricked and its sharp muzzle pointed into the doorway,
 and suddenly snapped at a fly like a piece of mechanism.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I looked at him. The red of his fair sunburnt complexion deepened
 suddenly under the down of his cheeks, invaded his forehead, spread to the
 roots of his curly hair. His ears became intensely crimson, and even the
 clear blue of his eyes was darkened many shades by the rush of blood to
 his head. His lips pouted a little, trembling as though he had been on the
 point of bursting into tears. I perceived he was incapable of pronouncing
 a word from the excess of his humiliation. From disappointment too?who
 knows? Perhaps he looked forward to that hammering he was going to give me
 for rehabilitation, for appeasement? Who can tell what relief he expected
 from this chance of a row? He was naive enough to expect anything; but he
 had given himself away for nothing in this case. He had been frank with
 himself?let alone with me?in the wild hope of arriving in that
 way at some effective refutation, and the stars had been ironically
 unpropitious. He made an inarticulate noise in his throat like a man
 imperfectly stunned by a blow on the head. It was pitiful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I didn't catch up again with him till well outside the gate. I had even
 to trot a bit at the last, but when, out of breath at his elbow, I taxed
 him with running away, he said, "Never!" and at once turned at bay. I
 explained I never meant to say he was running away from <i>me</i>. "From
 no man?from not a single man on earth," he affirmed with a stubborn
 mien. I forbore to point out the one obvious exception which would hold
 good for the bravest of us; I thought he would find out by himself very
 soon. He looked at me patiently while I was thinking of something to say,
 but I could find nothing on the spur of the moment, and he began to walk
 on. I kept up, and anxious not to lose him, I said hurriedly that I
 couldn't think of leaving him under a false impression of my?of my?I
 stammered. The stupidity of the phrase appalled me while I was trying to
 finish it, but the power of sentences has nothing to do with their sense
 or the logic of their construction. My idiotic mumble seemed to please
 him. He cut it short by saying, with courteous placidity that argued an
 immense power of self-control or else a wonderful elasticity of spirits?"Altogether
 my mistake." I marvelled greatly at this expression: he might have been
 alluding to some trifling occurrence. Hadn't he understood its deplorable
 meaning? "You may well forgive me," he continued, and went on a little
 moodily, "All these staring people in court seemed such fools that?that
 it might have been as I supposed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This opened suddenly a new view of him to my wonder. I looked at him
 curiously and met his unabashed and impenetrable eyes. "I can't put up
 with this kind of thing," he said, very simply, "and I don't mean to. In
 court it's different; I've got to stand that?and I can do it too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I don't pretend I understood him. The views he let me have of himself
 were like those glimpses through the shifting rents in a thick fog?bits
 of vivid and vanishing detail, giving no connected idea of the general
 aspect of a country. They fed one's curiosity without satisfying it; they
 were no good for purposes of orientation. Upon the whole he was
 misleading. That's how I summed him up to myself after he left me late in
 the evening. I had been staying at the Malabar House for a few days, and
 on my pressing invitation he dined with me there.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 7
 </h2>
 <p>
 'An outward-bound mail-boat had come in that afternoon, and the big
 dining-room of the hotel was more than half full of people with
 a-hundred-pounds-round-the-world tickets in their pockets. There were
 married couples looking domesticated and bored with each other in the
 midst of their travels; there were small parties and large parties, and
 lone individuals dining solemnly or feasting boisterously, but all
 thinking, conversing, joking, or scowling as was their wont at home; and
 just as intelligently receptive of new impressions as their trunks
 upstairs. Henceforth they would be labelled as having passed through this
 and that place, and so would be their luggage. They would cherish this
 distinction of their persons, and preserve the gummed tickets on their
 portmanteaus as documentary evidence, as the only permanent trace of their
 improving enterprise. The dark-faced servants tripped without noise over
 the vast and polished floor; now and then a girl's laugh would be heard,
 as innocent and empty as her mind, or, in a sudden hush of crockery, a few
 words in an affected drawl from some wit embroidering for the benefit of a
 grinning tableful the last funny story of shipboard scandal. Two nomadic
 old maids, dressed up to kill, worked acrimoniously through the bill of
 fare, whispering to each other with faded lips, wooden-faced and bizarre,
 like two sumptuous scarecrows. A little wine opened Jim's heart and
 loosened his tongue. His appetite was good, too, I noticed. He seemed to
 have buried somewhere the opening episode of our acquaintance. It was like
 a thing of which there would be no more question in this world. And all
 the time I had before me these blue, boyish eyes looking straight into
 mine, this young face, these capable shoulders, the open bronzed forehead
 with a white line under the roots of clustering fair hair, this appearance
 appealing at sight to all my sympathies: this frank aspect, the artless
 smile, the youthful seriousness. He was of the right sort; he was one of
 us. He talked soberly, with a sort of composed unreserve, and with a quiet
 bearing that might have been the outcome of manly self-control, of
 impudence, of callousness, of a colossal unconsciousness, of a gigantic
 deception. Who can tell! From our tone we might have been discussing a
 third person, a football match, last year's weather. My mind floated in a
 sea of conjectures till the turn of the conversation enabled me, without
 being offensive, to remark that, upon the whole, this inquiry must have
 been pretty trying to him. He darted his arm across the tablecloth, and
 clutching my hand by the side of my plate, glared fixedly. I was startled.
 "It must be awfully hard," I stammered, confused by this display of
 speechless feeling. "It is?hell," he burst out in a muffled voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This movement and these words caused two well-groomed male globe-trotters
 at a neighbouring table to look up in alarm from their iced pudding. I
 rose, and we passed into the front gallery for coffee and cigars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'On little octagon tables candles burned in glass globes; clumps of
 stiff-leaved plants separated sets of cosy wicker chairs; and between the
 pairs of columns, whose reddish shafts caught in a long row the sheen from
 the tall windows, the night, glittering and sombre, seemed to hang like a
 splendid drapery. The riding lights of ships winked afar like setting
 stars, and the hills across the roadstead resembled rounded black masses
 of arrested thunder-clouds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I couldn't clear out," Jim began. "The skipper did?that's all very
 well for him. I couldn't, and I wouldn't. They all got out of it in one
 way or another, but it wouldn't do for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I listened with concentrated attention, not daring to stir in my chair; I
 wanted to know?and to this day I don't know, I can only guess. He
 would be confident and depressed all in the same breath, as if some
 conviction of innate blamelessness had checked the truth writhing within
 him at every turn. He began by saying, in the tone in which a man would
 admit his inability to jump a twenty-foot wall, that he could never go
 home now; and this declaration recalled to my mind what Brierly had said,
 "that the old parson in Essex seemed to fancy his sailor son not a
 little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I can't tell you whether Jim knew he was especially "fancied," but the
 tone of his references to "my Dad" was calculated to give me a notion that
 the good old rural dean was about the finest man that ever had been
 worried by the cares of a large family since the beginning of the world.
 This, though never stated, was implied with an anxiety that there should
 be no mistake about it, which was really very true and charming, but added
 a poignant sense of lives far off to the other elements of the story. "He
 has seen it all in the home papers by this time," said Jim. "I can never
 face the poor old chap." I did not dare to lift my eyes at this till I
 heard him add, "I could never explain. He wouldn't understand." Then I
 looked up. He was smoking reflectively, and after a moment, rousing
 himself, began to talk again. He discovered at once a desire that I should
 not confound him with his partners in?in crime, let us call it. He
 was not one of them; he was altogether of another sort. I gave no sign of
 dissent. I had no intention, for the sake of barren truth, to rob him of
 the smallest particle of any saving grace that would come in his way. I
 didn't know how much of it he believed himself. I didn't know what he was
 playing up to?if he was playing up to anything at all?and I
 suspect he did not know either; for it is my belief no man ever
 understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of
 self-knowledge. I made no sound all the time he was wondering what he had
 better do after "that stupid inquiry was over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Apparently he shared Brierly's contemptuous opinion of these proceedings
 ordained by law. He would not know where to turn, he confessed, clearly
 thinking aloud rather than talking to me. Certificate gone, career broken,
 no money to get away, no work that he could obtain as far as he could see.
 At home he could perhaps get something; but it meant going to his people
 for help, and that he would not do. He saw nothing for it but ship before
 the mast?could get perhaps a quartermaster's billet in some steamer.
 Would do for a quartermaster. . . . "Do you think you would?" I asked
 pitilessly. He jumped up, and going to the stone balustrade looked out
 into the night. In a moment he was back, towering above my chair with his
 youthful face clouded yet by the pain of a conquered emotion. He had
 understood very well I did not doubt his ability to steer a ship. In a
 voice that quavered a bit he asked me why did I say that? I had been "no
 end kind" to him. I had not even laughed at him when?here he began
 to mumble?"that mistake, you know?made a confounded ass of
 myself." I broke in by saying rather warmly that for me such a mistake was
 not a matter to laugh at. He sat down and drank deliberately some coffee,
 emptying the small cup to the last drop. "That does not mean I admit for a
 moment the cap fitted," he declared distinctly. "No?" I said. "No," he
 affirmed with quiet decision. "Do you know what <i>you</i> would have
 done? Do you? And you don't think yourself" . . . he gulped something . .
 . "you don't think yourself a?a?cur?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And with this?upon my honour!?he looked up at me
 inquisitively. It was a question it appears?a bona fide question!
 However, he didn't wait for an answer. Before I could recover he went on,
 with his eyes straight before him, as if reading off something written on
 the body of the night. "It is all in being ready. I wasn't; not?not
 then. I don't want to excuse myself; but I would like to explain?I
 would like somebody to understand?somebody?one person at
 least! You! Why not you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was solemn, and a little ridiculous too, as they always are, those
 struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea of what
 his moral identity should be, this precious notion of a convention, only
 one of the rules of the game, nothing more, but all the same so terribly
 effective by its assumption of unlimited power over natural instincts, by
 the awful penalties of its failure. He began his story quietly enough. On
 board that Dale Line steamer that had picked up these four floating in a
 boat upon the discreet sunset glow of the sea, they had been after the
 first day looked askance upon. The fat skipper told some story, the others
 had been silent, and at first it had been accepted. You don't
 cross-examine poor castaways you had the good luck to save, if not from
 cruel death, then at least from cruel suffering. Afterwards, with time to
 think it over, it might have struck the officers of the Avondale that
 there was "something fishy" in the affair; but of course they would keep
 their doubts to themselves. They had picked up the captain, the mate, and
 two engineers of the steamer Patna sunk at sea, and that, very properly,
 was enough for them. I did not ask Jim about the nature of his feelings
 during the ten days he spent on board. From the way he narrated that part
 I was at liberty to infer he was partly stunned by the discovery he had
 made?the discovery about himself?and no doubt was at work
 trying to explain it away to the only man who was capable of appreciating
 all its tremendous magnitude. You must understand he did not try to
 minimise its importance. Of that I am sure; and therein lies his
 distinction. As to what sensations he experienced when he got ashore and
 heard the unforeseen conclusion of the tale in which he had taken such a
 pitiful part, he told me nothing of them, and it is difficult to imagine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I wonder whether he felt the ground cut from under his feet? I wonder?
 But no doubt he managed to get a fresh foothold very soon. He was ashore a
 whole fortnight waiting in the Sailors' Home, and as there were six or
 seven men staying there at the time, I had heard of him a little. Their
 languid opinion seemed to be that, in addition to his other shortcomings,
 he was a sulky brute. He had passed these days on the verandah, buried in
 a long chair, and coming out of his place of sepulture only at meal-times
 or late at night, when he wandered on the quays all by himself, detached
 from his surroundings, irresolute and silent, like a ghost without a home
 to haunt. "I don't think I've spoken three words to a living soul in all
 that time," he said, making me very sorry for him; and directly he added,
 "One of these fellows would have been sure to blurt out something I had
 made up my mind not to put up with, and I didn't want a row. No! Not then.
 I was too?too . . . I had no heart for it." "So that bulkhead held
 out after all," I remarked cheerfully. "Yes," he murmured, "it held. And
 yet I swear to you I felt it bulge under my hand." "It's extraordinary
 what strains old iron will stand sometimes," I said. Thrown back in his
 seat, his legs stiffly out and arms hanging down, he nodded slightly
 several times. You could not conceive a sadder spectacle. Suddenly he
 lifted his head; he sat up; he slapped his thigh. "Ah! what a chance
 missed! My God! what a chance missed!" he blazed out, but the ring of the
 last "missed" resembled a cry wrung out by pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He was silent again with a still, far-away look of fierce yearning after
 that missed distinction, with his nostrils for an instant dilated,
 sniffing the intoxicating breath of that wasted opportunity. If you think
 I was either surprised or shocked you do me an injustice in more ways than
 one! Ah, he was an imaginative beggar! He would give himself away; he
 would give himself up. I could see in his glance darted into the night all
 his inner being carried on, projected headlong into the fanciful realm of
 recklessly heroic aspirations. He had no leisure to regret what he had
 lost, he was so wholly and naturally concerned for what he had failed to
 obtain. He was very far away from me who watched him across three feet of
 space. With every instant he was penetrating deeper into the impossible
 world of romantic achievements. He got to the heart of it at last! A
 strange look of beatitude overspread his features, his eyes sparkled in
 the light of the candle burning between us; he positively smiled! He had
 penetrated to the very heart?to the very heart. It was an ecstatic
 smile that your faces?or mine either?will never wear, my dear
 boys. I whisked him back by saying, "If you had stuck to the ship, you
 mean!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He turned upon me, his eyes suddenly amazed and full of pain, with a
 bewildered, startled, suffering face, as though he had tumbled down from a
 star. Neither you nor I will ever look like this on any man. He shuddered
 profoundly, as if a cold finger-tip had touched his heart. Last of all he
 sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was not in a merciful mood. He provoked one by his contradictory
 indiscretions. "It is unfortunate you didn't know beforehand!" I said with
 every unkind intention; but the perfidious shaft fell harmless?dropped
 at his feet like a spent arrow, as it were, and he did not think of
 picking it up. Perhaps he had not even seen it. Presently, lolling at
 ease, he said, "Dash it all! I tell you it bulged. I was holding up my
 lamp along the angle-iron in the lower deck when a flake of rust as big as
 the palm of my hand fell off the plate, all of itself." He passed his hand
 over his forehead. "The thing stirred and jumped off like something alive
 while I was looking at it." "That made you feel pretty bad," I observed
 casually. "Do you suppose," he said, "that I was thinking of myself, with
 a hundred and sixty people at my back, all fast asleep in that
 fore-'tween-deck alone?and more of them aft; more on the deck?sleeping?knowing
 nothing about it?three times as many as there were boats for, even
 if there had been time? I expected to see the iron open out as I stood
 there and the rush of water going over them as they lay. . . . What could
 I do?what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I can easily picture him to myself in the peopled gloom of the cavernous
 place, with the light of the globe-lamp falling on a small portion of the
 bulkhead that had the weight of the ocean on the other side, and the
 breathing of unconscious sleepers in his ears. I can see him glaring at
 the iron, startled by the falling rust, overburdened by the knowledge of
 an imminent death. This, I gathered, was the second time he had been sent
 forward by that skipper of his, who, I rather think, wanted to keep him
 away from the bridge. He told me that his first impulse was to shout and
 straightway make all those people leap out of sleep into terror; but such
 an overwhelming sense of his helplessness came over him that he was not
 able to produce a sound. This is, I suppose, what people mean by the
 tongue cleaving to the roof of the mouth. "Too dry," was the concise
 expression he used in reference to this state. Without a sound, then, he
 scrambled out on deck through the number one hatch. A windsail rigged down
 there swung against him accidentally, and he remembered that the light
 touch of the canvas on his face nearly knocked him off the hatchway
 ladder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He confessed that his knees wobbled a good deal as he stood on the
 foredeck looking at another sleeping crowd. The engines having been
 stopped by that time, the steam was blowing off. Its deep rumble made the
 whole night vibrate like a bass string. The ship trembled to it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He saw here and there a head lifted off a mat, a vague form uprise in
 sitting posture, listen sleepily for a moment, sink down again into the
 billowy confusion of boxes, steam-winches, ventilators. He was aware all
 these people did not know enough to take intelligent notice of that
 strange noise. The ship of iron, the men with white faces, all the sights,
 all the sounds, everything on board to that ignorant and pious multitude
 was strange alike, and as trustworthy as it would for ever remain
 incomprehensible. It occurred to him that the fact was fortunate. The idea
 of it was simply terrible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'You must remember he believed, as any other man would have done in his
 place, that the ship would go down at any moment; the bulging, rust-eaten
 plates that kept back the ocean, fatally must give way, all at once like
 an undermined dam, and let in a sudden and overwhelming flood. He stood
 still looking at these recumbent bodies, a doomed man aware of his fate,
 surveying the silent company of the dead. They <i>were</i> dead! Nothing
 could save them! There were boats enough for half of them perhaps, but
 there was no time. No time! No time! It did not seem worth while to open
 his lips, to stir hand or foot. Before he could shout three words, or make
 three steps, he would be floundering in a sea whitened awfully by the
 desperate struggles of human beings, clamorous with the distress of cries
 for help. There was no help. He imagined what would happen perfectly; he
 went through it all motionless by the hatchway with the lamp in his hand?he
 went through it to the very last harrowing detail. I think he went through
 it again while he was telling me these things he could not tell the court.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I saw as clearly as I see you now that there was nothing I could do. It
 seemed to take all life out of my limbs. I thought I might just as well
 stand where I was and wait. I did not think I had many seconds. . . ."
 Suddenly the steam ceased blowing off. The noise, he remarked, had been
 distracting, but the silence at once became intolerably oppressive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I thought I would choke before I got drowned," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He protested he did not think of saving himself. The only distinct
 thought formed, vanishing, and re-forming in his brain, was: eight hundred
 people and seven boats; eight hundred people and seven boats.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Somebody was speaking aloud inside my head," he said a little wildly.
 "Eight hundred people and seven boats?and no time! Just think of
 it." He leaned towards me across the little table, and I tried to avoid
 his stare. "Do you think I was afraid of death?" he asked in a voice very
 fierce and low. He brought down his open hand with a bang that made the
 coffee-cups dance. "I am ready to swear I was not?I was not. . . .
 By God?no!" He hitched himself upright and crossed his arms; his
 chin fell on his breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The soft clashes of crockery reached us faintly through the high windows.
 There was a burst of voices, and several men came out in high good-humour
 into the gallery. They were exchanging jocular reminiscences of the
 donkeys in Cairo. A pale anxious youth stepping softly on long legs was
 being chaffed by a strutting and rubicund globe-trotter about his
 purchases in the bazaar. "No, really?do you think I've been done to
 that extent?" he inquired very earnest and deliberate. The band moved
 away, dropping into chairs as they went; matches flared, illuminating for
 a second faces without the ghost of an expression and the flat glaze of
 white shirt-fronts; the hum of many conversations animated with the ardour
 of feasting sounded to me absurd and infinitely remote.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Some of the crew were sleeping on the number one hatch within reach of
 my arm," began Jim again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'You must know they kept Kalashee watch in that ship, all hands sleeping
 through the night, and only the reliefs of quartermasters and look-out men
 being called. He was tempted to grip and shake the shoulder of the nearest
 lascar, but he didn't. Something held his arms down along his sides. He
 was not afraid?oh no! only he just couldn't?that's all. He was
 not afraid of death perhaps, but I'll tell you what, he was afraid of the
 emergency. His confounded imagination had evoked for him all the horrors
 of panic, the trampling rush, the pitiful screams, boats swamped?all
 the appalling incidents of a disaster at sea he had ever heard of. He
 might have been resigned to die but I suspect he wanted to die without
 added terrors, quietly, in a sort of peaceful trance. A certain readiness
 to perish is not so very rare, but it is seldom that you meet men whose
 souls, steeled in the impenetrable armour of resolution, are ready to
 fight a losing battle to the last; the desire of peace waxes stronger as
 hope declines, till at last it conquers the very desire of life. Which of
 us here has not observed this, or maybe experienced something of that
 feeling in his own person?this extreme weariness of emotions, the
 vanity of effort, the yearning for rest? Those striving with unreasonable
 forces know it well,?the shipwrecked castaways in boats, wanderers
 lost in a desert, men battling against the unthinking might of nature, or
 the stupid brutality of crowds.'

 CHAPTER 8
 </h2>
 <p>
 'How long he stood stock-still by the hatch expecting every moment to feel
 the ship dip under his feet and the rush of water take him at the back and
 toss him like a chip, I cannot say. Not very long?two minutes
 perhaps. A couple of men he could not make out began to converse drowsily,
 and also, he could not tell where, he detected a curious noise of
 shuffling feet. Above these faint sounds there was that awful stillness
 preceding a catastrophe, that trying silence of the moment before the
 crash; then it came into his head that perhaps he would have time to rush
 along and cut all the lanyards of the gripes, so that the boats would
 float as the ship went down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The Patna had a long bridge, and all the boats were up there, four on one
 side and three on the other?the smallest of them on the port-side
 and nearly abreast of the steering gear. He assured me, with evident
 anxiety to be believed, that he had been most careful to keep them ready
 for instant service. He knew his duty. I dare say he was a good enough
 mate as far as that went. "I always believed in being prepared for the
 worst," he commented, staring anxiously in my face. I nodded my approval
 of the sound principle, averting my eyes before the subtle unsoundness of
 the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He started unsteadily to run. He had to step over legs, avoid stumbling
 against the heads. Suddenly some one caught hold of his coat from below,
 and a distressed voice spoke under his elbow. The light of the lamp he
 carried in his right hand fell upon an upturned dark face whose eyes
 entreated him together with the voice. He had picked up enough of the
 language to understand the word water, repeated several times in a tone of
 insistence, of prayer, almost of despair. He gave a jerk to get away, and
 felt an arm embrace his leg.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"The beggar clung to me like a drowning man," he said impressively.
 "Water, water! What water did he mean? What did he know? As calmly as I
 could I ordered him to let go. He was stopping me, time was pressing,
 other men began to stir; I wanted time?time to cut the boats adrift.
 He got hold of my hand now, and I felt that he would begin to shout. It
 flashed upon me it was enough to start a panic, and I hauled off with my
 free arm and slung the lamp in his face. The glass jingled, the light went
 out, but the blow made him let go, and I ran off?I wanted to get at
 the boats; I wanted to get at the boats. He leaped after me from behind. I
 turned on him. He would not keep quiet; he tried to shout; I had half
 throttled him before I made out what he wanted. He wanted some water?water
 to drink; they were on strict allowance, you know, and he had with him a
 young boy I had noticed several times. His child was sick?and
 thirsty. He had caught sight of me as I passed by, and was begging for a
 little water. That's all. We were under the bridge, in the dark. He kept
 on snatching at my wrists; there was no getting rid of him. I dashed into
 my berth, grabbed my water-bottle, and thrust it into his hands. He
 vanished. I didn't find out till then how much I was in want of a drink
 myself." He leaned on one elbow with a hand over his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I felt a creepy sensation all down my backbone; there was something
 peculiar in all this. The fingers of the hand that shaded his brow
 trembled slightly. He broke the short silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"These things happen only once to a man and . . . Ah! well! When I got on
 the bridge at last the beggars were getting one of the boats off the
 chocks. A boat! I was running up the ladder when a heavy blow fell on my
 shoulder, just missing my head. It didn't stop me, and the chief engineer?they
 had got him out of his bunk by then?raised the boat-stretcher again.
 Somehow I had no mind to be surprised at anything. All this seemed natural?and
 awful?and awful. I dodged that miserable maniac, lifted him off the
 deck as though he had been a little child, and he started whispering in my
 arms: 'Don't! don't! I thought you were one of them niggers.' I flung him
 away, he skidded along the bridge and knocked the legs from under the
 little chap?the second. The skipper, busy about the boat, looked
 round and came at me head down, growling like a wild beast. I flinched no
 more than a stone. I was as solid standing there as this," he tapped
 lightly with his knuckles the wall beside his chair. "It was as though I
 had heard it all, seen it all, gone through it all twenty times already. I
 wasn't afraid of them. I drew back my fist and he stopped short, muttering?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"'Ah! it's you. Lend a hand quick.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"That's what he said. Quick! As if anybody could be quick enough. 'Aren't
 you going to do something?' I asked. 'Yes. Clear out,' he snarled over his
 shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I don't think I understood then what he meant. The other two had picked
 themselves up by that time, and they rushed together to the boat. They
 tramped, they wheezed, they shoved, they cursed the boat, the ship, each
 other?cursed me. All in mutters. I didn't move, I didn't speak. I
 watched the slant of the ship. She was as still as if landed on the blocks
 in a dry dock?only she was like this," He held up his hand, palm
 under, the tips of the fingers inclined downwards. "Like this," he
 repeated. "I could see the line of the horizon before me, as clear as a
 bell, above her stem-head; I could see the water far off there black and
 sparkling, and still?still as a-pond, deadly still, more still than
 ever sea was before?more still than I could bear to look at. Have
 you watched a ship floating head down, checked in sinking by a sheet of
 old iron too rotten to stand being shored up? Have you? Oh yes, shored up?
 I thought of that?I thought of every mortal thing; but can you shore
 up a bulkhead in five minutes?or in fifty for that matter? Where was
 I going to get men that would go down below? And the timber?the
 timber! Would you have had the courage to swing the maul for the first
 blow if you had seen that bulkhead? Don't say you would: you had not seen
 it; nobody would. Hang it?to do a thing like that you must believe
 there is a chance, one in a thousand, at least, some ghost of a chance;
 and you would not have believed. Nobody would have believed. You think me
 a cur for standing there, but what would you have done? What! You can't
 tell?nobody can tell. One must have time to turn round. What would
 you have me do? Where was the kindness in making crazy with fright all
 those people I could not save single-handed?that nothing could save?
 Look here! As true as I sit on this chair before you . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He drew quick breaths at every few words and shot quick glances at my
 face, as though in his anguish he were watchful of the effect. He was not
 speaking to me, he was only speaking before me, in a dispute with an
 invisible personality, an antagonistic and inseparable partner of his
 existence?another possessor of his soul. These were issues beyond
 the competency of a court of inquiry: it was a subtle and momentous
 quarrel as to the true essence of life, and did not want a judge. He
 wanted an ally, a helper, an accomplice. I felt the risk I ran of being
 circumvented, blinded, decoyed, bullied, perhaps, into taking a definite
 part in a dispute impossible of decision if one had to be fair to all the
 phantoms in possession?to the reputable that had its claims and to
 the disreputable that had its exigencies. I can't explain to you who
 haven't seen him and who hear his words only at second hand the mixed
 nature of my feelings. It seemed to me I was being made to comprehend the
 Inconceivable?and I know of nothing to compare with the discomfort
 of such a sensation. I was made to look at the convention that lurks in
 all truth and on the essential sincerity of falsehood. He appealed to all
 sides at once?to the side turned perpetually to the light of day,
 and to that side of us which, like the other hemisphere of the moon,
 exists stealthily in perpetual darkness, with only a fearful ashy light
 falling at times on the edge. He swayed me. I own to it, I own up. The
 occasion was obscure, insignificant?what you will: a lost youngster,
 one in a million?but then he was one of us; an incident as
 completely devoid of importance as the flooding of an ant-heap, and yet
 the mystery of his attitude got hold of me as though he had been an
 individual in the forefront of his kind, as if the obscure truth involved
 were momentous enough to affect mankind's conception of itself. . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Marlow paused to put new life into his expiring cheroot, seemed to forget
 all about the story, and abruptly began again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'My fault of course. One has no business really to get interested. It's a
 weakness of mine. His was of another kind. My weakness consists in not
 having a discriminating eye for the incidental?for the externals?no
 eye for the hod of the rag-picker or the fine linen of the next man. Next
 man?that's it. I have met so many men,' he pursued, with momentary
 sadness?'met them too with a certain?certain?impact, let
 us say; like this fellow, for instance?and in each case all I could
 see was merely the human being. A confounded democratic quality of vision
 which may be better than total blindness, but has been of no advantage to
 me, I can assure you. Men expect one to take into account their fine
 linen. But I never could get up any enthusiasm about these things. Oh!
 it's a failing; it's a failing; and then comes a soft evening; a lot of
 men too indolent for whist?and a story. . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He paused again to wait for an encouraging remark, perhaps, but nobody
 spoke; only the host, as if reluctantly performing a duty, murmured?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'You are so subtle, Marlow.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Who? I?' said Marlow in a low voice. 'Oh no! But <i>he</i> was; and try
 as I may for the success of this yarn, I am missing innumerable shades?they
 were so fine, so difficult to render in colourless words. Because he
 complicated matters by being so simple, too?the simplest poor devil!
 . . . By Jove! he was amazing. There he sat telling me that just as I saw
 him before my eyes he wouldn't be afraid to face anything?and
 believing in it too. I tell you it was fabulously innocent and it was
 enormous, enormous! I watched him covertly, just as though I had suspected
 him of an intention to take a jolly good rise out of me. He was confident
 that, on the square, "on the square, mind!" there was nothing he couldn't
 meet. Ever since he had been "so high"?"quite a little chap," he had
 been preparing himself for all the difficulties that can beset one on land
 and water. He confessed proudly to this kind of foresight. He had been
 elaborating dangers and defences, expecting the worst, rehearsing his
 best. He must have led a most exalted existence. Can you fancy it? A
 succession of adventures, so much glory, such a victorious progress! and
 the deep sense of his sagacity crowning every day of his inner life. He
 forgot himself; his eyes shone; and with every word my heart, searched by
 the light of his absurdity, was growing heavier in my breast. I had no
 mind to laugh, and lest I should smile I made for myself a stolid face. He
 gave signs of irritation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It is always the unexpected that happens," I said in a propitiatory
 tone. My obtuseness provoked him into a contemptuous "Pshaw!" I suppose he
 meant that the unexpected couldn't touch him; nothing less than the
 unconceivable itself could get over his perfect state of preparation. He
 had been taken unawares?and he whispered to himself a malediction
 upon the waters and the firmament, upon the ship, upon the men. Everything
 had betrayed him! He had been tricked into that sort of high-minded
 resignation which prevented him lifting as much as his little finger,
 while these others who had a very clear perception of the actual necessity
 were tumbling against each other and sweating desperately over that boat
 business. Something had gone wrong there at the last moment. It appears
 that in their flurry they had contrived in some mysterious way to get the
 sliding bolt of the foremost boat-chock jammed tight, and forthwith had
 gone out of the remnants of their minds over the deadly nature of that
 accident. It must have been a pretty sight, the fierce industry of these
 beggars toiling on a motionless ship that floated quietly in the silence
 of a world asleep, fighting against time for the freeing of that boat,
 grovelling on all-fours, standing up in despair, tugging, pushing,
 snarling at each other venomously, ready to kill, ready to weep, and only
 kept from flying at each other's throats by the fear of death that stood
 silent behind them like an inflexible and cold-eyed taskmaster. Oh yes! It
 must have been a pretty sight. He saw it all, he could talk about it with
 scorn and bitterness; he had a minute knowledge of it by means of some
 sixth sense, I conclude, because he swore to me he had remained apart
 without a glance at them and at the boat?without one single glance.
 And I believe him. I should think he was too busy watching the threatening
 slant of the ship, the suspended menace discovered in the midst of the
 most perfect security?fascinated by the sword hanging by a hair over
 his imaginative head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Nothing in the world moved before his eyes, and he could depict to
 himself without hindrance the sudden swing upwards of the dark sky-line,
 the sudden tilt up of the vast plain of the sea, the swift still rise, the
 brutal fling, the grasp of the abyss, the struggle without hope, the
 starlight closing over his head for ever like the vault of a tomb?the
 revolt of his young life?the black end. He could! By Jove! who
 couldn't? And you must remember he was a finished artist in that peculiar
 way, he was a gifted poor devil with the faculty of swift and forestalling
 vision. The sights it showed him had turned him into cold stone from the
 soles of his feet to the nape of his neck; but there was a hot dance of
 thoughts in his head, a dance of lame, blind, mute thoughts?a whirl
 of awful cripples. Didn't I tell you he confessed himself before me as
 though I had the power to bind and to loose? He burrowed deep, deep, in
 the hope of my absolution, which would have been of no good to him. This
 was one of those cases which no solemn deception can palliate, where no
 man can help; where his very Maker seems to abandon a sinner to his own
 devices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He stood on the starboard side of the bridge, as far as he could get from
 the struggle for the boat, which went on with the agitation of madness and
 the stealthiness of a conspiracy. The two Malays had meantime remained
 holding to the wheel. Just picture to yourselves the actors in that, thank
 God! unique, episode of the sea, four beside themselves with fierce and
 secret exertions, and three looking on in complete immobility, above the
 awnings covering the profound ignorance of hundreds of human beings, with
 their weariness, with their dreams, with their hopes, arrested, held by an
 invisible hand on the brink of annihilation. For that they were so, makes
 no doubt to me: given the state of the ship, this was the deadliest
 possible description of accident that could happen. These beggars by the
 boat had every reason to go distracted with funk. Frankly, had I been
 there, I would not have given as much as a counterfeit farthing for the
 ship's chance to keep above water to the end of each successive second.
 And still she floated! These sleeping pilgrims were destined to accomplish
 their whole pilgrimage to the bitterness of some other end. It was as if
 the Omnipotence whose mercy they confessed had needed their humble
 testimony on earth for a while longer, and had looked down to make a sign,
 "Thou shalt not!" to the ocean. Their escape would trouble me as a
 prodigiously inexplicable event, did I not know how tough old iron can be?as
 tough sometimes as the spirit of some men we meet now and then, worn to a
 shadow and breasting the weight of life. Not the least wonder of these
 twenty minutes, to my mind, is the behaviour of the two helmsmen. They
 were amongst the native batch of all sorts brought over from Aden to give
 evidence at the inquiry. One of them, labouring under intense bashfulness,
 was very young, and with his smooth, yellow, cheery countenance looked
 even younger than he was. I remember perfectly Brierly asking him, through
 the interpreter, what he thought of it at the time, and the interpreter,
 after a short colloquy, turning to the court with an important air?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He says he thought nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The other, with patient blinking eyes, a blue cotton handkerchief, faded
 with much washing, bound with a smart twist over a lot of grey wisps, his
 face shrunk into grim hollows, his brown skin made darker by a mesh of
 wrinkles, explained that he had a knowledge of some evil thing befalling
 the ship, but there had been no order; he could not remember an order; why
 should he leave the helm? To some further questions he jerked back his
 spare shoulders, and declared it never came into his mind then that the
 white men were about to leave the ship through fear of death. He did not
 believe it now. There might have been secret reasons. He wagged his old
 chin knowingly. Aha! secret reasons. He was a man of great experience, and
 he wanted <i>that</i> white Tuan to know?he turned towards Brierly,
 who didn't raise his head?that he had acquired a knowledge of many
 things by serving white men on the sea for a great number of years?and,
 suddenly, with shaky excitement he poured upon our spellbound attention a
 lot of queer-sounding names, names of dead-and-gone skippers, names of
 forgotten country ships, names of familiar and distorted sound, as if the
 hand of dumb time had been at work on them for ages. They stopped him at
 last. A silence fell upon the court,?a silence that remained
 unbroken for at least a minute, and passed gently into a deep murmur. This
 episode was the sensation of the second day's proceedings?affecting
 all the audience, affecting everybody except Jim, who was sitting moodily
 at the end of the first bench, and never looked up at this extraordinary
 and damning witness that seemed possessed of some mysterious theory of
 defence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'So these two lascars stuck to the helm of that ship without steerage-way,
 where death would have found them if such had been their destiny. The
 whites did not give them half a glance, had probably forgotten their
 existence. Assuredly Jim did not remember it. He remembered he could do
 nothing; he could do nothing, now he was alone. There was nothing to do
 but to sink with the ship. No use making a disturbance about it. Was
 there? He waited upstanding, without a sound, stiffened in the idea of
 some sort of heroic discretion. The first engineer ran cautiously across
 the bridge to tug at his sleeve.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Come and help! For God's sake, come and help!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He ran back to the boat on the points of his toes, and returned directly
 to worry at his sleeve, begging and cursing at the same time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I believe he would have kissed my hands," said Jim savagely, "and, next
 moment, he starts foaming and whispering in my face, 'If I had the time I
 would like to crack your skull for you.' I pushed him away. Suddenly he
 caught hold of me round the neck. Damn him! I hit him. I hit out without
 looking. 'Won't you save your own life?you infernal coward?' he
 sobs. Coward! He called me an infernal coward! Ha! ha! ha! ha! He called
 me?ha! ha! ha! . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He had thrown himself back and was shaking with laughter. I had never in
 my life heard anything so bitter as that noise. It fell like a blight on
 all the merriment about donkeys, pyramids, bazaars, or what not. Along the
 whole dim length of the gallery the voices dropped, the pale blotches of
 faces turned our way with one accord, and the silence became so profound
 that the clear tinkle of a teaspoon falling on the tesselated floor of the
 verandah rang out like a tiny and silvery scream.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You mustn't laugh like this, with all these people about," I
 remonstrated. "It isn't nice for them, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He gave no sign of having heard at first, but after a while, with a stare
 that, missing me altogether, seemed to probe the heart of some awful
 vision, he muttered carelessly?"Oh! they'll think I am drunk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And after that you would have thought from his appearance he would never
 make a sound again. But?no fear! He could no more stop telling now
 than he could have stopped living by the mere exertion of his will.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 9
 </h2>
 <p>
 '"I was saying to myself, 'Sink?curse you! Sink!'" These were the
 words with which he began again. He wanted it over. He was severely left
 alone, and he formulated in his head this address to the ship in a tone of
 imprecation, while at the same time he enjoyed the privilege of witnessing
 scenes?as far as I can judge?of low comedy. They were still at
 that bolt. The skipper was ordering, "Get under and try to lift"; and the
 others naturally shirked. You understand that to be squeezed flat under
 the keel of a boat wasn't a desirable position to be caught in if the ship
 went down suddenly. "Why don't you?you the strongest?" whined the
 little engineer. "Gott-for-dam! I am too thick," spluttered the skipper in
 despair. It was funny enough to make angels weep. They stood idle for a
 moment, and suddenly the chief engineer rushed again at Jim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Come and help, man! Are you mad to throw your only chance away? Come and
 help, man! Man! Look there?look!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And at last Jim looked astern where the other pointed with maniacal
 insistence. He saw a silent black squall which had eaten up already
 one-third of the sky. You know how these squalls come up there about that
 time of the year. First you see a darkening of the horizon?no more;
 then a cloud rises opaque like a wall. A straight edge of vapour lined
 with sickly whitish gleams flies up from the southwest, swallowing the
 stars in whole constellations; its shadow flies over the waters, and
 confounds sea and sky into one abyss of obscurity. And all is still. No
 thunder, no wind, no sound; not a flicker of lightning. Then in the
 tenebrous immensity a livid arch appears; a swell or two like undulations
 of the very darkness run past, and suddenly, wind and rain strike together
 with a peculiar impetuosity as if they had burst through something solid.
 Such a cloud had come up while they weren't looking. They had just noticed
 it, and were perfectly justified in surmising that if in absolute
 stillness there was some chance for the ship to keep afloat a few minutes
 longer, the least disturbance of the sea would make an end of her
 instantly. Her first nod to the swell that precedes the burst of such a
 squall would be also her last, would become a plunge, would, so to speak,
 be prolonged into a long dive, down, down to the bottom. Hence these new
 capers of their fright, these new antics in which they displayed their
 extreme aversion to die.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It was black, black," pursued Jim with moody steadiness. "It had sneaked
 upon us from behind. The infernal thing! I suppose there had been at the
 back of my head some hope yet. I don't know. But that was all over anyhow.
 It maddened me to see myself caught like this. I was angry, as though I
 had been trapped. I <i>was</i> trapped! The night was hot, too, I
 remember. Not a breath of air."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He remembered so well that, gasping in the chair, he seemed to sweat and
 choke before my eyes. No doubt it maddened him; it knocked him over afresh?in
 a manner of speaking?but it made him also remember that important
 purpose which had sent him rushing on that bridge only to slip clean out
 of his mind. He had intended to cut the lifeboats clear of the ship. He
 whipped out his knife and went to work slashing as though he had seen
 nothing, had heard nothing, had known of no one on board. They thought him
 hopelessly wrong-headed and crazy, but dared not protest noisily against
 this useless loss of time. When he had done he returned to the very same
 spot from which he had started. The chief was there, ready with a clutch
 at him to whisper close to his head, scathingly, as though he wanted to
 bite his ear?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You silly fool! do you think you'll get the ghost of a show when all
 that lot of brutes is in the water? Why, they will batter your head for
 you from these boats."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He wrung his hands, ignored, at Jim's elbow. The skipper kept up a
 nervous shuffle in one place and mumbled, "Hammer! hammer! Mein Gott! Get
 a hammer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The little engineer whimpered like a child, but, broken arm and all, he
 turned out the least craven of the lot as it seems, and, actually,
 mustered enough pluck to run an errand to the engine-room. No trifle, it
 must be owned in fairness to him. Jim told me he darted desperate looks
 like a cornered man, gave one low wail, and dashed off. He was back
 instantly clambering, hammer in hand, and without a pause flung himself at
 the bolt. The others gave up Jim at once and ran off to assist. He heard
 the tap, tap of the hammer, the sound of the released chock falling over.
 The boat was clear. Only then he turned to look?only then. But he
 kept his distance?he kept his distance. He wanted me to know he had
 kept his distance; that there was nothing in common between him and these
 men?who had the hammer. Nothing whatever. It is more than probable
 he thought himself cut off from them by a space that could not be
 traversed, by an obstacle that could not be overcome, by a chasm without
 bottom. He was as far as he could get from them?the whole breadth of
 the ship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His feet were glued to that remote spot and his eyes to their indistinct
 group bowed together and swaying strangely in the common torment of fear.
 A hand-lamp lashed to a stanchion above a little table rigged up on the
 bridge?the Patna had no chart-room amidships?threw a light on
 their labouring shoulders, on their arched and bobbing backs. They pushed
 at the bow of the boat; they pushed out into the night; they pushed, and
 would no more look back at him. They had given him up as if indeed he had
 been too far, too hopelessly separated from themselves, to be worth an
 appealing word, a glance, or a sign. They had no leisure to look back upon
 his passive heroism, to feel the sting of his abstention. The boat was
 heavy; they pushed at the bow with no breath to spare for an encouraging
 word: but the turmoil of terror that had scattered their self-command like
 chaff before the wind, converted their desperate exertions into a bit of
 fooling, upon my word, fit for knockabout clowns in a farce. They pushed
 with their hands, with their heads, they pushed for dear life with all the
 weight of their bodies, they pushed with all the might of their souls?only
 no sooner had they succeeded in canting the stem clear of the davit than
 they would leave off like one man and start a wild scramble into her. As a
 natural consequence the boat would swing in abruptly, driving them back,
 helpless and jostling against each other. They would stand nonplussed for
 a while, exchanging in fierce whispers all the infamous names they could
 call to mind, and go at it again. Three times this occurred. He described
 it to me with morose thoughtfulness. He hadn't lost a single movement of
 that comic business. "I loathed them. I hated them. I had to look at all
 that," he said without emphasis, turning upon me a sombrely watchful
 glance. "Was ever there any one so shamefully tried?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He took his head in his hands for a moment, like a man driven to
 distraction by some unspeakable outrage. These were things he could not
 explain to the court?and not even to me; but I would have been
 little fitted for the reception of his confidences had I not been able at
 times to understand the pauses between the words. In this assault upon his
 fortitude there was the jeering intention of a spiteful and vile
 vengeance; there was an element of burlesque in his ordeal?a
 degradation of funny grimaces in the approach of death or dishonour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He related facts which I have not forgotten, but at this distance of time
 I couldn't recall his very words: I only remember that he managed
 wonderfully to convey the brooding rancour of his mind into the bare
 recital of events. Twice, he told me, he shut his eyes in the certitude
 that the end was upon him already, and twice he had to open them again.
 Each time he noted the darkening of the great stillness. The shadow of the
 silent cloud had fallen upon the ship from the zenith, and seemed to have
 extinguished every sound of her teeming life. He could no longer hear the
 voices under the awnings. He told me that each time he closed his eyes a
 flash of thought showed him that crowd of bodies, laid out for death, as
 plain as daylight. When he opened them, it was to see the dim struggle of
 four men fighting like mad with a stubborn boat. "They would fall back
 before it time after time, stand swearing at each other, and suddenly make
 another rush in a bunch. . . . Enough to make you die laughing," he
 commented with downcast eyes; then raising them for a moment to my face
 with a dismal smile, "I ought to have a merry life of it, by God! for I
 shall see that funny sight a good many times yet before I die." His eyes
 fell again. "See and hear. . . . See and hear," he repeated twice, at long
 intervals, filled by vacant staring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He roused himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I made up my mind to keep my eyes shut," he said, "and I couldn't. I
 couldn't, and I don't care who knows it. Let them go through that kind of
 thing before they talk. Just let them?and do better?that's
 all. The second time my eyelids flew open and my mouth too. I had felt the
 ship move. She just dipped her bows?and lifted them gently?and
 slow! everlastingly slow; and ever so little. She hadn't done that much
 for days. The cloud had raced ahead, and this first swell seemed to travel
 upon a sea of lead. There was no life in that stir. It managed, though, to
 knock over something in my head. What would you have done? You are sure of
 yourself?aren't you? What would you do if you felt now?this
 minute?the house here move, just move a little under your chair.
 Leap! By heavens! you would take one spring from where you sit and land in
 that clump of bushes yonder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He flung his arm out at the night beyond the stone balustrade. I held my
 peace. He looked at me very steadily, very severe. There could be no
 mistake: I was being bullied now, and it behoved me to make no sign lest
 by a gesture or a word I should be drawn into a fatal admission about
 myself which would have had some bearing on the case. I was not disposed
 to take any risk of that sort. Don't forget I had him before me, and
 really he was too much like one of us not to be dangerous. But if you want
 to know I don't mind telling you that I did, with a rapid glance, estimate
 the distance to the mass of denser blackness in the middle of the
 grass-plot before the verandah. He exaggerated. I would have landed short
 by several feet?and that's the only thing of which I am fairly
 certain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The last moment had come, as he thought, and he did not move. His feet
 remained glued to the planks if his thoughts were knocking about loose in
 his head. It was at this moment too that he saw one of the men around the
 boat step backwards suddenly, clutch at the air with raised arms, totter
 and collapse. He didn't exactly fall, he only slid gently into a sitting
 posture, all hunched up, and with his shoulders propped against the side
 of the engine-room skylight. "That was the donkey-man. A haggard,
 white-faced chap with a ragged moustache. Acted third engineer," he
 explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Dead," I said. We had heard something of that in court.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"So they say," he pronounced with sombre indifference. "Of course I never
 knew. Weak heart. The man had been complaining of being out of sorts for
 some time before. Excitement. Over-exertion. Devil only knows. Ha! ha! ha!
 It was easy to see he did not want to die either. Droll, isn't it? May I
 be shot if he hadn't been fooled into killing himself! Fooled?neither
 more nor less. Fooled into it, by heavens! just as I . . . Ah! If he had
 only kept still; if he had only told them to go to the devil when they
 came to rush him out of his bunk because the ship was sinking! If he had
 only stood by with his hands in his pockets and called them names!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He got up, shook his fist, glared at me, and sat down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"A chance missed, eh?" I murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Why don't you laugh?" he said. "A joke hatched in hell. Weak heart! . .
 . I wish sometimes mine had been."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This irritated me. "Do you?" I exclaimed with deep-rooted irony. "Yes!
 Can't <i>you</i> understand?" he cried. "I don't know what more you could
 wish for," I said angrily. He gave me an utterly uncomprehending glance.
 This shaft had also gone wide of the mark, and he was not the man to
 bother about stray arrows. Upon my word, he was too unsuspecting; he was
 not fair game. I was glad that my missile had been thrown away,?that
 he had not even heard the twang of the bow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Of course he could not know at the time the man was dead. The next minute?his
 last on board?was crowded with a tumult of events and sensations
 which beat about him like the sea upon a rock. I use the simile advisedly,
 because from his relation I am forced to believe he had preserved through
 it all a strange illusion of passiveness, as though he had not acted but
 had suffered himself to be handled by the infernal powers who had selected
 him for the victim of their practical joke. The first thing that came to
 him was the grinding surge of the heavy davits swinging out at last?a
 jar which seemed to enter his body from the deck through the soles of his
 feet, and travel up his spine to the crown of his head. Then, the squall
 being very near now, another and a heavier swell lifted the passive hull
 in a threatening heave that checked his breath, while his brain and his
 heart together were pierced as with daggers by panic-stricken screams.
 "Let go! For God's sake, let go! Let go! She's going." Following upon that
 the boat-falls ripped through the blocks, and a lot of men began to talk
 in startled tones under the awnings. "When these beggars did break out,
 their yelps were enough to wake the dead," he said. Next, after the
 splashing shock of the boat literally dropped in the water, came the
 hollow noises of stamping and tumbling in her, mingled with confused
 shouts: "Unhook! Unhook! Shove! Unhook! Shove for your life! Here's the
 squall down on us. . . ." He heard, high above his head, the faint
 muttering of the wind; he heard below his feet a cry of pain. A lost voice
 alongside started cursing a swivel hook. The ship began to buzz fore and
 aft like a disturbed hive, and, as quietly as he was telling me of all
 this?because just then he was very quiet in attitude, in face, in
 voice?he went on to say without the slightest warning as it were, "I
 stumbled over his legs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This was the first I heard of his having moved at all. I could not
 restrain a grunt of surprise. Something had started him off at last, but
 of the exact moment, of the cause that tore him out of his immobility, he
 knew no more than the uprooted tree knows of the wind that laid it low.
 All this had come to him: the sounds, the sights, the legs of the dead man?by
 Jove! The infernal joke was being crammed devilishly down his throat, but?look
 you?he was not going to admit of any sort of swallowing motion in
 his gullet. It's extraordinary how he could cast upon you the spirit of
 his illusion. I listened as if to a tale of black magic at work upon a
 corpse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He went over sideways, very gently, and this is the last thing I
 remember seeing on board," he continued. "I did not care what he did. It
 looked as though he were picking himself up: I thought he was picking
 himself up, of course: I expected him to bolt past me over the rail and
 drop into the boat after the others. I could hear them knocking about down
 there, and a voice as if crying up a shaft called out 'George!' Then three
 voices together raised a yell. They came to me separately: one bleated,
 another screamed, one howled. Ough!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He shivered a little, and I beheld him rise slowly as if a steady hand
 from above had been pulling him out of the chair by his hair. Up, slowly?to
 his full height, and when his knees had locked stiff the hand let him go,
 and he swayed a little on his feet. There was a suggestion of awful
 stillness in his face, in his movements, in his very voice when he said
 "They shouted"?and involuntarily I pricked up my ears for the ghost
 of that shout that would be heard directly through the false effect of
 silence. "There were eight hundred people in that ship," he said, impaling
 me to the back of my seat with an awful blank stare. "Eight hundred living
 people, and they were yelling after the one dead man to come down and be
 saved. 'Jump, George! Jump! Oh, jump!' I stood by with my hand on the
 davit. I was very quiet. It had come over pitch dark. You could see
 neither sky nor sea. I heard the boat alongside go bump, bump, and not
 another sound down there for a while, but the ship under me was full of
 talking noises. Suddenly the skipper howled 'Mein Gott! The squall! The
 squall! Shove off!' With the first hiss of rain, and the first gust of
 wind, they screamed, 'Jump, George! We'll catch you! Jump!' The ship began
 a slow plunge; the rain swept over her like a broken sea; my cap flew off
 my head; my breath was driven back into my throat. I heard as if I had
 been on the top of a tower another wild screech, 'Geo-o-o-orge! Oh, jump!'
 She was going down, down, head first under me. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He raised his hand deliberately to his face, and made picking motions
 with his fingers as though he had been bothered with cobwebs, and
 afterwards he looked into the open palm for quite half a second before he
 blurted out?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I had jumped . . ." He checked himself, averted his gaze. . . . "It
 seems," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His clear blue eyes turned to me with a piteous stare, and looking at him
 standing before me, dumfounded and hurt, I was oppressed by a sad sense of
 resigned wisdom, mingled with the amused and profound pity of an old man
 helpless before a childish disaster.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Looks like it," I muttered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I knew nothing about it till I looked up," he explained hastily. And
 that's possible, too. You had to listen to him as you would to a small boy
 in trouble. He didn't know. It had happened somehow. It would never happen
 again. He had landed partly on somebody and fallen across a thwart. He
 felt as though all his ribs on his left side must be broken; then he
 rolled over, and saw vaguely the ship he had deserted uprising above him,
 with the red side-light glowing large in the rain like a fire on the brow
 of a hill seen through a mist. "She seemed higher than a wall; she loomed
 like a cliff over the boat . . . I wished I could die," he cried. "There
 was no going back. It was as if I had jumped into a well?into an
 everlasting deep hole. . . ."'

 CHAPTER 10
 </h2>
 <p>
 'He locked his fingers together and tore them apart. Nothing could be more
 true: he had indeed jumped into an everlasting deep hole. He had tumbled
 from a height he could never scale again. By that time the boat had gone
 driving forward past the bows. It was too dark just then for them to see
 each other, and, moreover, they were blinded and half drowned with rain.
 He told me it was like being swept by a flood through a cavern. They
 turned their backs to the squall; the skipper, it seems, got an oar over
 the stern to keep the boat before it, and for two or three minutes the end
 of the world had come through a deluge in a pitchy blackness. The sea
 hissed "like twenty thousand kettles." That's his simile, not mine. I
 fancy there was not much wind after the first gust; and he himself had
 admitted at the inquiry that the sea never got up that night to any
 extent. He crouched down in the bows and stole a furtive glance back. He
 saw just one yellow gleam of the mast-head light high up and blurred like
 a last star ready to dissolve. "It terrified me to see it still there," he
 said. That's what he said. What terrified him was the thought that the
 drowning was not over yet. No doubt he wanted to be done with that
 abomination as quickly as possible. Nobody in the boat made a sound. In
 the dark she seemed to fly, but of course she could not have had much way.
 Then the shower swept ahead, and the great, distracting, hissing noise
 followed the rain into distance and died out. There was nothing to be
 heard then but the slight wash about the boat's sides. Somebody's teeth
 were chattering violently. A hand touched his back. A faint voice said,
 "You there?" Another cried out shakily, "She's gone!" and they all stood
 up together to look astern. They saw no lights. All was black. A thin cold
 drizzle was driving into their faces. The boat lurched slightly. The teeth
 chattered faster, stopped, and began again twice before the man could
 master his shiver sufficiently to say, "Ju-ju-st in ti-ti-me. . . .
 Brrrr." He recognised the voice of the chief engineer saying surlily, "I
 saw her go down. I happened to turn my head." The wind had dropped almost
 completely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'They watched in the dark with their heads half turned to windward as if
 expecting to hear cries. At first he was thankful the night had covered up
 the scene before his eyes, and then to know of it and yet to have seen and
 heard nothing appeared somehow the culminating point of an awful
 misfortune. "Strange, isn't it?" he murmured, interrupting himself in his
 disjointed narrative.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It did not seem so strange to me. He must have had an unconscious
 conviction that the reality could not be half as bad, not half as
 anguishing, appalling, and vengeful as the created terror of his
 imagination. I believe that, in this first moment, his heart was wrung
 with all the suffering, that his soul knew the accumulated savour of all
 the fear, all the horror, all the despair of eight hundred human beings
 pounced upon in the night by a sudden and violent death, else why should
 he have said, "It seemed to me that I must jump out of that accursed boat
 and swim back to see?half a mile?more?any distance?to
 the very spot . . ."? Why this impulse? Do you see the significance? Why
 back to the very spot? Why not drown alongside?if he meant drowning?
 Why back to the very spot, to see?as if his imagination had to be
 soothed by the assurance that all was over before death could bring
 relief? I defy any one of you to offer another explanation. It was one of
 those bizarre and exciting glimpses through the fog. It was an
 extraordinary disclosure. He let it out as the most natural thing one
 could say. He fought down that impulse and then he became conscious of the
 silence. He mentioned this to me. A silence of the sea, of the sky, merged
 into one indefinite immensity still as death around these saved,
 palpitating lives. "You might have heard a pin drop in the boat," he said
 with a queer contraction of his lips, like a man trying to master his
 sensibilities while relating some extremely moving fact. A silence! God
 alone, who had willed him as he was, knows what he made of it in his
 heart. "I didn't think any spot on earth could be so still," he said. "You
 couldn't distinguish the sea from the sky; there was nothing to see and
 nothing to hear. Not a glimmer, not a shape, not a sound. You could have
 believed that every bit of dry land had gone to the bottom; that every man
 on earth but I and these beggars in the boat had got drowned." He leaned
 over the table with his knuckles propped amongst coffee-cups,
 liqueur-glasses, cigar-ends. "I seemed to believe it. Everything was gone
 and?all was over . . ." he fetched a deep sigh . . . "with me."'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Marlow sat up abruptly and flung away his cheroot with force. It made a
 darting red trail like a toy rocket fired through the drapery of creepers.
 Nobody stirred.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Hey, what do you think of it?' he cried with sudden animation. 'Wasn't he
 true to himself, wasn't he? His saved life was over for want of ground
 under his feet, for want of sights for his eyes, for want of voices in his
 ears. Annihilation?hey! And all the time it was only a clouded sky,
 a sea that did not break, the air that did not stir. Only a night; only a
 silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It lasted for a while, and then they were suddenly and unanimously moved
 to make a noise over their escape. "I knew from the first she would go."
 "Not a minute too soon." "A narrow squeak, b'gosh!" He said nothing, but
 the breeze that had dropped came back, a gentle draught freshened
 steadily, and the sea joined its murmuring voice to this talkative
 reaction succeeding the dumb moments of awe. She was gone! She was gone!
 Not a doubt of it. Nobody could have helped. They repeated the same words
 over and over again as though they couldn't stop themselves. Never doubted
 she would go. The lights were gone. No mistake. The lights were gone.
 Couldn't expect anything else. She had to go. . . . He noticed that they
 talked as though they had left behind them nothing but an empty ship. They
 concluded she would not have been long when she once started. It seemed to
 cause them some sort of satisfaction. They assured each other that she
 couldn't have been long about it?"Just shot down like a flat-iron."
 The chief engineer declared that the mast-head light at the moment of
 sinking seemed to drop "like a lighted match you throw down." At this the
 second laughed hysterically. "I am g-g-glad, I am gla-a-a-d." His teeth
 went on "like an electric rattle," said Jim, "and all at once he began to
 cry. He wept and blubbered like a child, catching his breath and sobbing
 'Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!' He would be quiet for a while and start
 suddenly, 'Oh, my poor arm! oh, my poor a-a-a-arm!' I felt I could knock
 him down. Some of them sat in the stern-sheets. I could just make out
 their shapes. Voices came to me, mumble, mumble, grunt, grunt. All this
 seemed very hard to bear. I was cold too. And I could do nothing. I
 thought that if I moved I would have to go over the side and . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His hand groped stealthily, came in contact with a liqueur-glass, and was
 withdrawn suddenly as if it had touched a red-hot coal. I pushed the
 bottle slightly. "Won't you have some more?" I asked. He looked at me
 angrily. "Don't you think I can tell you what there is to tell without
 screwing myself up?" he asked. The squad of globe-trotters had gone to
 bed. We were alone but for a vague white form erect in the shadow, that,
 being looked at, cringed forward, hesitated, backed away silently. It was
 getting late, but I did not hurry my guest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In the midst of his forlorn state he heard his companions begin to abuse
 some one. "What kept you from jumping, you lunatic?" said a scolding
 voice. The chief engineer left the stern-sheets, and could be heard
 clambering forward as if with hostile intentions against "the greatest
 idiot that ever was." The skipper shouted with rasping effort offensive
 epithets from where he sat at the oar. He lifted his head at that uproar,
 and heard the name "George," while a hand in the dark struck him on the
 breast. "What have you got to say for yourself, you fool?" queried
 somebody, with a sort of virtuous fury. "They were after me," he said.
 "They were abusing me?abusing me . . . by the name of George."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He paused to stare, tried to smile, turned his eyes away and went on.
 "That little second puts his head right under my nose, 'Why, it's that
 blasted mate!' 'What!' howls the skipper from the other end of the boat.
 'No!' shrieks the chief. And he too stooped to look at my face."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The wind had left the boat suddenly. The rain began to fall again, and
 the soft, uninterrupted, a little mysterious sound with which the sea
 receives a shower arose on all sides in the night. "They were too taken
 aback to say anything more at first," he narrated steadily, "and what
 could I have to say to them?" He faltered for a moment, and made an effort
 to go on. "They called me horrible names." His voice, sinking to a
 whisper, now and then would leap up suddenly, hardened by the passion of
 scorn, as though he had been talking of secret abominations. "Never mind
 what they called me," he said grimly. "I could hear hate in their voices.
 A good thing too. They could not forgive me for being in that boat. They
 hated it. It made them mad. . . ." He laughed short. . . . "But it kept me
 from?Look! I was sitting with my arms crossed, on the gunwale! . .
 ." He perched himself smartly on the edge of the table and crossed his
 arms. . . . "Like this?see? One little tilt backwards and I would
 have been gone?after the others. One little tilt?the least bit?the
 least bit." He frowned, and tapping his forehead with the tip of his
 middle finger, "It was there all the time," he said impressively. "All the
 time?that notion. And the rain?cold, thick, cold as melted
 snow?colder?on my thin cotton clothes?I'll never be so
 cold again in my life, I know. And the sky was black too?all black.
 Not a star, not a light anywhere. Nothing outside that confounded boat and
 those two yapping before me like a couple of mean mongrels at a tree'd
 thief. Yap! yap! 'What you doing here? You're a fine sort! Too much of a
 bloomin' gentleman to put your hand to it. Come out of your trance, did
 you? To sneak in? Did you?' Yap! yap! 'You ain't fit to live!' Yap! yap!
 Two of them together trying to out-bark each other. The other would bay
 from the stern through the rain?couldn't see him?couldn't make
 it out?some of his filthy jargon. Yap! yap! Bow-ow-ow-ow-ow! Yap!
 yap! It was sweet to hear them; it kept me alive, I tell you. It saved my
 life. At it they went, as if trying to drive me overboard with the noise!
 . . . 'I wonder you had pluck enough to jump. You ain't wanted here. If I
 had known who it was, I would have tipped you over?you skunk! What
 have you done with the other? Where did you get the pluck to jump?you
 coward? What's to prevent us three from firing you overboard?' . . . They
 were out of breath; the shower passed away upon the sea. Then nothing.
 There was nothing round the boat, not even a sound. Wanted to see me
 overboard, did they? Upon my soul! I think they would have had their wish
 if they had only kept quiet. Fire me overboard! Would they? 'Try,' I said.
 'I would for twopence.' 'Too good for you,' they screeched together. It
 was so dark that it was only when one or the other of them moved that I
 was quite sure of seeing him. By heavens! I only wish they had tried."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I couldn't help exclaiming, "What an extraordinary affair!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Not bad?eh?" he said, as if in some sort astounded. "They
 pretended to think I had done away with that donkey-man for some reason or
 other. Why should I? And how the devil was I to know? Didn't I get somehow
 into that boat? into that boat?I . . ." The muscles round his lips
 contracted into an unconscious grimace that tore through the mask of his
 usual expression?something violent, short-lived and illuminating
 like a twist of lightning that admits the eye for an instant into the
 secret convolutions of a cloud. "I did. I was plainly there with them?wasn't
 I? Isn't it awful a man should be driven to do a thing like that?and
 be responsible? What did I know about their George they were howling
 after? I remembered I had seen him curled up on the deck. 'Murdering
 coward!' the chief kept on calling me. He didn't seem able to remember any
 other two words. I didn't care, only his noise began to worry me. 'Shut
 up,' I said. At that he collected himself for a confounded screech. 'You
 killed him! You killed him!' 'No,' I shouted, 'but I will kill you
 directly.' I jumped up, and he fell backwards over a thwart with an awful
 loud thump. I don't know why. Too dark. Tried to step back I suppose. I
 stood still facing aft, and the wretched little second began to whine,
 'You ain't going to hit a chap with a broken arm?and you call
 yourself a gentleman, too.' I heard a heavy tramp?one?two?and
 wheezy grunting. The other beast was coming at me, clattering his oar over
 the stern. I saw him moving, big, big?as you see a man in a mist, in
 a dream. 'Come on,' I cried. I would have tumbled him over like a bale of
 shakings. He stopped, muttered to himself, and went back. Perhaps he had
 heard the wind. I didn't. It was the last heavy gust we had. He went back
 to his oar. I was sorry. I would have tried to?to . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He opened and closed his curved fingers, and his hands had an eager and
 cruel flutter. "Steady, steady," I murmured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Eh? What? I am not excited," he remonstrated, awfully hurt, and with a
 convulsive jerk of his elbow knocked over the cognac bottle. I started
 forward, scraping my chair. He bounced off the table as if a mine had been
 exploded behind his back, and half turned before he alighted, crouching on
 his feet to show me a startled pair of eyes and a face white about the
 nostrils. A look of intense annoyance succeeded. "Awfully sorry. How
 clumsy of me!" he mumbled, very vexed, while the pungent odour of spilt
 alcohol enveloped us suddenly with an atmosphere of a low drinking-bout in
 the cool, pure darkness of the night. The lights had been put out in the
 dining-hall; our candle glimmered solitary in the long gallery, and the
 columns had turned black from pediment to capital. On the vivid stars the
 high corner of the Harbour Office stood out distinct across the Esplanade,
 as though the sombre pile had glided nearer to see and hear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He assumed an air of indifference.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I dare say I am less calm now than I was then. I was ready for anything.
 These were trifles. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You had a lively time of it in that boat," I remarked
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I was ready," he repeated. "After the ship's lights had gone, anything
 might have happened in that boat?anything in the world?and the
 world no wiser. I felt this, and I was pleased. It was just dark enough
 too. We were like men walled up quick in a roomy grave. No concern with
 anything on earth. Nobody to pass an opinion. Nothing mattered." For the
 third time during this conversation he laughed harshly, but there was no
 one about to suspect him of being only drunk. "No fear, no law, no sounds,
 no eyes?not even our own, till?till sunrise at least."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was struck by the suggestive truth of his words. There is something
 peculiar in a small boat upon the wide sea. Over the lives borne from
 under the shadow of death there seems to fall the shadow of madness. When
 your ship fails you, your whole world seems to fail you; the world that
 made you, restrained you, took care of you. It is as if the souls of men
 floating on an abyss and in touch with immensity had been set free for any
 excess of heroism, absurdity, or abomination. Of course, as with belief,
 thought, love, hate, conviction, or even the visual aspect of material
 things, there are as many shipwrecks as there are men, and in this one
 there was something abject which made the isolation more complete?there
 was a villainy of circumstances that cut these men off more completely
 from the rest of mankind, whose ideal of conduct had never undergone the
 trial of a fiendish and appalling joke. They were exasperated with him for
 being a half-hearted shirker: he focussed on them his hatred of the whole
 thing; he would have liked to take a signal revenge for the abhorrent
 opportunity they had put in his way. Trust a boat on the high seas to
 bring out the Irrational that lurks at the bottom of every thought,
 sentiment, sensation, emotion. It was part of the burlesque meanness
 pervading that particular disaster at sea that they did not come to blows.
 It was all threats, all a terribly effective feint, a sham from beginning
 to end, planned by the tremendous disdain of the Dark Powers whose real
 terrors, always on the verge of triumph, are perpetually foiled by the
 steadfastness of men. I asked, after waiting for a while, "Well, what
 happened?" A futile question. I knew too much already to hope for the
 grace of a single uplifting touch, for the favour of hinted madness, of
 shadowed horror. "Nothing," he said. "I meant business, but they meant
 noise only. Nothing happened."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And the rising sun found him just as he had jumped up first in the bows
 of the boat. What a persistence of readiness! He had been holding the
 tiller in his hand, too, all the night. They had dropped the rudder
 overboard while attempting to ship it, and I suppose the tiller got kicked
 forward somehow while they were rushing up and down that boat trying to do
 all sorts of things at once so as to get clear of the side. It was a long
 heavy piece of hard wood, and apparently he had been clutching it for six
 hours or so. If you don't call that being ready! Can you imagine him,
 silent and on his feet half the night, his face to the gusts of rain,
 staring at sombre forms watchful of vague movements, straining his ears to
 catch rare low murmurs in the stern-sheets! Firmness of courage or effort
 of fear? What do you think? And the endurance is undeniable too. Six hours
 more or less on the defensive; six hours of alert immobility while the
 boat drove slowly or floated arrested, according to the caprice of the
 wind; while the sea, calmed, slept at last; while the clouds passed above
 his head; while the sky from an immensity lustreless and black, diminished
 to a sombre and lustrous vault, scintillated with a greater brilliance,
 faded to the east, paled at the zenith; while the dark shapes blotting the
 low stars astern got outlines, relief became shoulders, heads, faces,
 features,?confronted him with dreary stares, had dishevelled hair,
 torn clothes, blinked red eyelids at the white dawn. "They looked as
 though they had been knocking about drunk in gutters for a week," he
 described graphically; and then he muttered something about the sunrise
 being of a kind that foretells a calm day. You know that sailor habit of
 referring to the weather in every connection. And on my side his few
 mumbled words were enough to make me see the lower limb of the sun
 clearing the line of the horizon, the tremble of a vast ripple running
 over all the visible expanse of the sea, as if the waters had shuddered,
 giving birth to the globe of light, while the last puff of the breeze
 would stir the air in a sigh of relief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"They sat in the stern shoulder to shoulder, with the skipper in the
 middle, like three dirty owls, and stared at me," I heard him say with an
 intention of hate that distilled a corrosive virtue into the commonplace
 words like a drop of powerful poison falling into a glass of water; but my
 thoughts dwelt upon that sunrise. I could imagine under the pellucid
 emptiness of the sky these four men imprisoned in the solitude of the sea,
 the lonely sun, regardless of the speck of life, ascending the clear curve
 of the heaven as if to gaze ardently from a greater height at his own
 splendour reflected in the still ocean. "They called out to me from aft,"
 said Jim, "as though we had been chums together. I heard them. They were
 begging me to be sensible and drop that 'blooming piece of wood.' Why <i>would</i>
 I carry on so? They hadn't done me any harm?had they? There had been
 no harm. . . . No harm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His face crimsoned as though he could not get rid of the air in his
 lungs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"No harm!" he burst out. "I leave it to you. You can understand. Can't
 you? You see it?don't you? No harm! Good God! What more could they
 have done? Oh yes, I know very well?I jumped. Certainly. I jumped! I
 told you I jumped; but I tell you they were too much for any man. It was
 their doing as plainly as if they had reached up with a boat-hook and
 pulled me over. Can't you see it? You must see it. Come. Speak?straight
 out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His uneasy eyes fastened upon mine, questioned, begged, challenged,
 entreated. For the life of me I couldn't help murmuring, "You've been
 tried." "More than is fair," he caught up swiftly. "I wasn't given half a
 chance?with a gang like that. And now they were friendly?oh,
 so damnably friendly! Chums, shipmates. All in the same boat. Make the
 best of it. They hadn't meant anything. They didn't care a hang for
 George. George had gone back to his berth for something at the last moment
 and got caught. The man was a manifest fool. Very sad, of course. . . .
 Their eyes looked at me; their lips moved; they wagged their heads at the
 other end of the boat?three of them; they beckoned?to me. Why
 not? Hadn't I jumped? I said nothing. There are no words for the sort of
 things I wanted to say. If I had opened my lips just then I would have
 simply howled like an animal. I was asking myself when I would wake up.
 They urged me aloud to come aft and hear quietly what the skipper had to
 say. We were sure to be picked up before the evening?right in the
 track of all the Canal traffic; there was smoke to the north-west now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It gave me an awful shock to see this faint, faint blur, this low trail
 of brown mist through which you could see the boundary of sea and sky. I
 called out to them that I could hear very well where I was. The skipper
 started swearing, as hoarse as a crow. He wasn't going to talk at the top
 of his voice for <i>my</i> accommodation. 'Are you afraid they will hear
 you on shore?' I asked. He glared as if he would have liked to claw me to
 pieces. The chief engineer advised him to humour me. He said I wasn't
 right in my head yet. The other rose astern, like a thick pillar of flesh?and
 talked?talked. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim remained thoughtful. "Well?" I said. "What did I care what story they
 agreed to make up?" he cried recklessly. "They could tell what they jolly
 well liked. It was their business. I knew the story. Nothing they could
 make people believe could alter it for me. I let him talk, argue?talk,
 argue. He went on and on and on. Suddenly I felt my legs give way under
 me. I was sick, tired?tired to death. I let fall the tiller, turned
 my back on them, and sat down on the foremost thwart. I had enough. They
 called to me to know if I understood?wasn't it true, every word of
 it? It was true, by God! after their fashion. I did not turn my head. I
 heard them palavering together. 'The silly ass won't say anything.' 'Oh,
 he understands well enough.' 'Let him be; he will be all right.' 'What can
 he do?' What could I do? Weren't we all in the same boat? I tried to be
 deaf. The smoke had disappeared to the northward. It was a dead calm. They
 had a drink from the water-breaker, and I drank too. Afterwards they made
 a great business of spreading the boat-sail over the gunwales. Would I
 keep a look-out? They crept under, out of my sight, thank God! I felt
 weary, weary, done up, as if I hadn't had one hour's sleep since the day I
 was born. I couldn't see the water for the glitter of the sunshine. From
 time to time one of them would creep out, stand up to take a look all
 round, and get under again. I could hear spells of snoring below the sail.
 Some of them could sleep. One of them at least. I couldn't! All was light,
 light, and the boat seemed to be falling through it. Now and then I would
 feel quite surprised to find myself sitting on a thwart. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He began to walk with measured steps to and fro before my chair, one hand
 in his trousers-pocket, his head bent thoughtfully, and his right arm at
 long intervals raised for a gesture that seemed to put out of his way an
 invisible intruder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I suppose you think I was going mad," he began in a changed tone. "And
 well you may, if you remember I had lost my cap. The sun crept all the way
 from east to west over my bare head, but that day I could not come to any
 harm, I suppose. The sun could not make me mad. . . ." His right arm put
 aside the idea of madness. . . . "Neither could it kill me. . . ." Again
 his arm repulsed a shadow. . . . "<i>That</i> rested with me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Did it?" I said, inexpressibly amazed at this new turn, and I looked at
 him with the same sort of feeling I might be fairly conceived to
 experience had he, after spinning round on his heel, presented an
 altogether new face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I didn't get brain fever, I did not drop dead either," he went on. "I
 didn't bother myself at all about the sun over my head. I was thinking as
 coolly as any man that ever sat thinking in the shade. That greasy beast
 of a skipper poked his big cropped head from under the canvas and screwed
 his fishy eyes up at me. 'Donnerwetter! you will die,' he growled, and
 drew in like a turtle. I had seen him. I had heard him. He didn't
 interrupt me. I was thinking just then that I wouldn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He tried to sound my thought with an attentive glance dropped on me in
 passing. "Do you mean to say you had been deliberating with yourself
 whether you would die?" I asked in as impenetrable a tone as I could
 command. He nodded without stopping. "Yes, it had come to that as I sat
 there alone," he said. He passed on a few steps to the imaginary end of
 his beat, and when he flung round to come back both his hands were thrust
 deep into his pockets. He stopped short in front of my chair and looked
 down. "Don't you believe it?" he inquired with tense curiosity. I was
 moved to make a solemn declaration of my readiness to believe implicitly
 anything he thought fit to tell me.'

 CHAPTER 11
 </h2>
 <p>
 'He heard me out with his head on one side, and I had another glimpse
 through a rent in the mist in which he moved and had his being. The dim
 candle spluttered within the ball of glass, and that was all I had to see
 him by; at his back was the dark night with the clear stars, whose distant
 glitter disposed in retreating planes lured the eye into the depths of a
 greater darkness; and yet a mysterious light seemed to show me his boyish
 head, as if in that moment the youth within him had, for a moment, glowed
 and expired. "You are an awful good sort to listen like this," he said.
 "It does me good. You don't know what it is to me. You don't" . . . words
 seemed to fail him. It was a distinct glimpse. He was a youngster of the
 sort you like to see about you; of the sort you like to imagine yourself
 to have been; of the sort whose appearance claims the fellowship of these
 illusions you had thought gone out, extinct, cold, and which, as if
 rekindled at the approach of another flame, give a flutter deep, deep down
 somewhere, give a flutter of light . . . of heat! . . . Yes; I had a
 glimpse of him then . . . and it was not the last of that kind. . . . "You
 don't know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed?make
 a clean breast of it to an elder man. It is so difficult?so awfully
 unfair?so hard to understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The mists were closing again. I don't know how old I appeared to him?and
 how much wise. Not half as old as I felt just then; not half as uselessly
 wise as I knew myself to be. Surely in no other craft as in that of the
 sea do the hearts of those already launched to sink or swim go out so much
 to the youth on the brink, looking with shining eyes upon that glitter of
 the vast surface which is only a reflection of his own glances full of
 fire. There is such magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had
 driven each of us to sea, such a glorious indefiniteness, such a beautiful
 greed of adventures that are their own and only reward. What we get?well,
 we won't talk of that; but can one of us restrain a smile? In no other
 kind of life is the illusion more wide of reality?in no other is the
 beginning <i>all</i> illusion?the disenchantment more swift?the
 subjugation more complete. Hadn't we all commenced with the same desire,
 ended with the same knowledge, carried the memory of the same cherished
 glamour through the sordid days of imprecation? What wonder that when some
 heavy prod gets home the bond is found to be close; that besides the
 fellowship of the craft there is felt the strength of a wider feeling?the
 feeling that binds a man to a child. He was there before me, believing
 that age and wisdom can find a remedy against the pain of truth, giving me
 a glimpse of himself as a young fellow in a scrape that is the very devil
 of a scrape, the sort of scrape greybeards wag at solemnly while they hide
 a smile. And he had been deliberating upon death?confound him! He
 had found that to meditate about because he thought he had saved his life,
 while all its glamour had gone with the ship in the night. What more
 natural! It was tragic enough and funny enough in all conscience to call
 aloud for compassion, and in what was I better than the rest of us to
 refuse him my pity? And even as I looked at him the mists rolled into the
 rent, and his voice spoke?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I was so lost, you know. It was the sort of thing one does not expect to
 happen to one. It was not like a fight, for instance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It was not," I admitted. He appeared changed, as if he had suddenly
 matured.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"One couldn't be sure," he muttered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Ah! You were not sure," I said, and was placated by the sound of a faint
 sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Well, I wasn't," he said courageously. "It was something like that
 wretched story they made up. It was not a lie?but it wasn't truth
 all the same. It was something. . . . One knows a downright lie. There was
 not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and the wrong of
 this affair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"How much more did you want?" I asked; but I think I spoke so low that he
 did not catch what I said. He had advanced his argument as though life had
 been a network of paths separated by chasms. His voice sounded reasonable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Suppose I had not?I mean to say, suppose I had stuck to the ship?
 Well. How much longer? Say a minute?half a minute. Come. In thirty
 seconds, as it seemed certain then, I would have been overboard; and do
 you think I would not have laid hold of the first thing that came in my
 way?oar, life-buoy, grating?anything? Wouldn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And be saved," I interjected.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I would have meant to be," he retorted. "And that's more than I meant
 when I" . . . he shivered as if about to swallow some nauseous drug . . .
 "jumped," he pronounced with a convulsive effort, whose stress, as if
 propagated by the waves of the air, made my body stir a little in the
 chair. He fixed me with lowering eyes. "Don't you believe me?" he cried.
 "I swear! . . . Confound it! You got me here to talk, and . . . You must!
 . . . You said you would believe." "Of course I do," I protested, in a
 matter-of-fact tone which produced a calming effect. "Forgive me," he
 said. "Of course I wouldn't have talked to you about all this if you had
 not been a gentleman. I ought to have known . . . I am?I am?a
 gentleman too . . ." "Yes, yes," I said hastily. He was looking me
 squarely in the face, and withdrew his gaze slowly. "Now you understand
 why I didn't after all . . . didn't go out in that way. I wasn't going to
 be frightened at what I had done. And, anyhow, if I had stuck to the ship
 I would have done my best to be saved. Men have been known to float for
 hours?in the open sea?and be picked up not much the worse for
 it. I might have lasted it out better than many others. There's nothing
 the matter with my heart." He withdrew his right fist from his pocket, and
 the blow he struck on his chest resounded like a muffled detonation in the
 night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"No," I said. He meditated, with his legs slightly apart and his chin
 sunk. "A hair's-breadth," he muttered. "Not the breadth of a hair between
 this and that. And at the time . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It is difficult to see a hair at midnight," I put in, a little viciously
 I fear. Don't you see what I mean by the solidarity of the craft? I was
 aggrieved against him, as though he had cheated me?me!?of a
 splendid opportunity to keep up the illusion of my beginnings, as though
 he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour. "And so
 you cleared out?at once."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Jumped," he corrected me incisively. "Jumped?mind!" he repeated,
 and I wondered at the evident but obscure intention. "Well, yes! Perhaps I
 could not see then. But I had plenty of time and any amount of light in
 that boat. And I could think, too. Nobody would know, of course, but this
 did not make it any easier for me. You've got to believe that, too. I did
 not want all this talk. . . . No . . . Yes . . . I won't lie . . . I
 wanted it: it is the very thing I wanted?there. Do you think you or
 anybody could have made me if I . . . I am?I am not afraid to tell.
 And I wasn't afraid to think either. I looked it in the face. I wasn't
 going to run away. At first?at night, if it hadn't been for those
 fellows I might have . . . No! by heavens! I was not going to give them
 that satisfaction. They had done enough. They made up a story, and
 believed it for all I know. But I knew the truth, and I would live it down?alone,
 with myself. I wasn't going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing.
 What did it prove after all? I was confoundedly cut up. Sick of life?to
 tell you the truth; but what would have been the good to shirk it?in?in?that
 way? That was not the way. I believe?I believe it would have?it
 would have ended?nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He had been walking up and down, but with the last word he turned short
 at me.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What do <i>you</i> believe?" he asked with violence. A pause ensued, and
 suddenly I felt myself overcome by a profound and hopeless fatigue, as
 though his voice had startled me out of a dream of wandering through empty
 spaces whose immensity had harassed my soul and exhausted my body.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '". . . Would have ended nothing," he muttered over me obstinately, after
 a little while. "No! the proper thing was to face it out?alone for
 myself?wait for another chance?find out . . ."'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 12
 </h2>
 <p>
 'All around everything was still as far as the ear could reach. The mist
 of his feelings shifted between us, as if disturbed by his struggles, and
 in the rifts of the immaterial veil he would appear to my staring eyes
 distinct of form and pregnant with vague appeal like a symbolic figure in
 a picture. The chill air of the night seemed to lie on my limbs as heavy
 as a slab of marble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I see," I murmured, more to prove to myself that I could break my state
 of numbness than for any other reason.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"The Avondale picked us up just before sunset," he remarked moodily.
 "Steamed right straight for us. We had only to sit and wait."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'After a long interval, he said, "They told their story." And again there
 was that oppressive silence. "Then only I knew what it was I had made up
 my mind to," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You said nothing," I whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What could I say?" he asked, in the same low tone. . . . "Shock slight.
 Stopped the ship. Ascertained the damage. Took measures to get the boats
 out without creating a panic. As the first boat was lowered ship went down
 in a squall. Sank like lead. . . . What could be more clear" . . . he hung
 his head . . . "and more awful?" His lips quivered while he looked
 straight into my eyes. "I had jumped?hadn't I?" he asked, dismayed.
 "That's what I had to live down. The story didn't matter." . . . He
 clasped his hands for an instant, glanced right and left into the gloom:
 "It was like cheating the dead," he stammered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And there were no dead," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He went away from me at this. That is the only way I can describe it. In
 a moment I saw his back close to the balustrade. He stood there for some
 time, as if admiring the purity and the peace of the night. Some
 flowering-shrub in the garden below spread its powerful scent through the
 damp air. He returned to me with hasty steps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And that did not matter," he said, as stubbornly as you please.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Perhaps not," I admitted. I began to have a notion he was too much for
 me. After all, what did <i>I</i> know?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Dead or not dead, I could not get clear," he said. "I had to live;
 hadn't I?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Well, yes?if you take it in that way," I mumbled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I was glad, of course," he threw out carelessly, with his mind fixed on
 something else. "The exposure," he pronounced slowly, and lifted his head.
 "Do you know what was my first thought when I heard? I was relieved. I was
 relieved to learn that those shouts?did I tell you I had heard
 shouts? No? Well, I did. Shouts for help . . . blown along with the
 drizzle. Imagination, I suppose. And yet I can hardly . . . How stupid. .
 . . The others did not. I asked them afterwards. They all said No. No? And
 I was hearing them even then! I might have known?but I didn't think?I
 only listened. Very faint screams?day after day. Then that little
 half-caste chap here came up and spoke to me. 'The Patna . . . French
 gunboat . . . towed successfully to Aden . . . Investigation . . . Marine
 Office . . . Sailors' Home . . . arrangements made for your board and
 lodging!' I walked along with him, and I enjoyed the silence. So there had
 been no shouting. Imagination. I had to believe him. I could hear nothing
 any more. I wonder how long I could have stood it. It was getting worse,
 too . . . I mean?louder." 'He fell into thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And I had heard nothing! Well?so be it. But the lights! The lights
 did go! We did not see them. They were not there. If they had been, I
 would have swam back?I would have gone back and shouted alongside?I
 would have begged them to take me on board. . . . I would have had my
 chance. . . . You doubt me? . . . How do you know how I felt? . . . What
 right have you to doubt? . . . I very nearly did it as it was?do you
 understand?" His voice fell. "There was not a glimmer?not a
 glimmer," he protested mournfully. "Don't you understand that if there had
 been, you would not have seen me here? You see me?and you doubt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I shook my head negatively. This question of the lights being lost sight
 of when the boat could not have been more than a quarter of a mile from
 the ship was a matter for much discussion. Jim stuck to it that there was
 nothing to be seen after the first shower had cleared away; and the others
 had affirmed the same thing to the officers of the Avondale. Of course
 people shook their heads and smiled. One old skipper who sat near me in
 court tickled my ear with his white beard to murmur, "Of course they would
 lie." As a matter of fact nobody lied; not even the chief engineer with
 his story of the mast-head light dropping like a match you throw down. Not
 consciously, at least. A man with his liver in such a state might very
 well have seen a floating spark in the corner of his eye when stealing a
 hurried glance over his shoulder. They had seen no light of any sort
 though they were well within range, and they could only explain this in
 one way: the ship had gone down. It was obvious and comforting. The
 foreseen fact coming so swiftly had justified their haste. No wonder they
 did not cast about for any other explanation. Yet the true one was very
 simple, and as soon as Brierly suggested it the court ceased to bother
 about the question. If you remember, the ship had been stopped, and was
 lying with her head on the course steered through the night, with her
 stern canted high and her bows brought low down in the water through the
 filling of the fore-compartment. Being thus out of trim, when the squall
 struck her a little on the quarter, she swung head to wind as sharply as
 though she had been at anchor. By this change in her position all her
 lights were in a very few moments shut off from the boat to leeward. It
 may very well be that, had they been seen, they would have had the effect
 of a mute appeal?that their glimmer lost in the darkness of the
 cloud would have had the mysterious power of the human glance that can
 awaken the feelings of remorse and pity. It would have said, "I am here?still
 here" . . . and what more can the eye of the most forsaken of human beings
 say? But she turned her back on them as if in disdain of their fate: she
 had swung round, burdened, to glare stubbornly at the new danger of the
 open sea which she so strangely survived to end her days in a breaking-up
 yard, as if it had been her recorded fate to die obscurely under the blows
 of many hammers. What were the various ends their destiny provided for the
 pilgrims I am unable to say; but the immediate future brought, at about
 nine o'clock next morning, a French gunboat homeward bound from Reunion.
 The report of her commander was public property. He had swept a little out
 of his course to ascertain what was the matter with that steamer floating
 dangerously by the head upon a still and hazy sea. There was an ensign,
 union down, flying at her main gaff (the serang had the sense to make a
 signal of distress at daylight); but the cooks were preparing the food in
 the cooking-boxes forward as usual. The decks were packed as close as a
 sheep-pen: there were people perched all along the rails, jammed on the
 bridge in a solid mass; hundreds of eyes stared, and not a sound was heard
 when the gunboat ranged abreast, as if all that multitude of lips had been
 sealed by a spell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The Frenchman hailed, could get no intelligible reply, and after
 ascertaining through his binoculars that the crowd on deck did not look
 plague-stricken, decided to send a boat. Two officers came on board,
 listened to the serang, tried to talk with the Arab, couldn't make head or
 tail of it: but of course the nature of the emergency was obvious enough.
 They were also very much struck by discovering a white man, dead and
 curled up peacefully on the bridge. "Fort intrigues par ce cadavre," as I
 was informed a long time after by an elderly French lieutenant whom I came
 across one afternoon in Sydney, by the merest chance, in a sort of cafe,
 and who remembered the affair perfectly. Indeed this affair, I may notice
 in passing, had an extraordinary power of defying the shortness of
 memories and the length of time: it seemed to live, with a sort of uncanny
 vitality, in the minds of men, on the tips of their tongues. I've had the
 questionable pleasure of meeting it often, years afterwards, thousands of
 miles away, emerging from the remotest possible talk, coming to the
 surface of the most distant allusions. Has it not turned up to-night
 between us? And I am the only seaman here. I am the only one to whom it is
 a memory. And yet it has made its way out! But if two men who, unknown to
 each other, knew of this affair met accidentally on any spot of this
 earth, the thing would pop up between them as sure as fate, before they
 parted. I had never seen that Frenchman before, and at the end of an hour
 we had done with each other for life: he did not seem particularly
 talkative either; he was a quiet, massive chap in a creased uniform,
 sitting drowsily over a tumbler half full of some dark liquid. His
 shoulder-straps were a bit tarnished, his clean-shaved cheeks were large
 and sallow; he looked like a man who would be given to taking snuff?don't
 you know? I won't say he did; but the habit would have fitted that kind of
 man. It all began by his handing me a number of Home News, which I didn't
 want, across the marble table. I said "Merci." We exchanged a few
 apparently innocent remarks, and suddenly, before I knew how it had come
 about, we were in the midst of it, and he was telling me how much they had
 been "intrigued by that corpse." It turned out he had been one of the
 boarding officers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In the establishment where we sat one could get a variety of foreign
 drinks which were kept for the visiting naval officers, and he took a sip
 of the dark medical-looking stuff, which probably was nothing more nasty
 than cassis a l'eau, and glancing with one eye into the tumbler, shook his
 head slightly. "Impossible de comprendre?vous concevez," he said,
 with a curious mixture of unconcern and thoughtfulness. I could very
 easily conceive how impossible it had been for them to understand. Nobody
 in the gunboat knew enough English to get hold of the story as told by the
 serang. There was a good deal of noise, too, round the two officers. "They
 crowded upon us. There was a circle round that dead man (autour de ce
 mort)," he described. "One had to attend to the most pressing. These
 people were beginning to agitate themselves?Parbleu! A mob like that?don't
 you see?" he interjected with philosophic indulgence. As to the bulkhead,
 he had advised his commander that the safest thing was to leave it alone,
 it was so villainous to look at. They got two hawsers on board promptly
 (en toute hale) and took the Patna in tow?stern foremost at that?which,
 under the circumstances, was not so foolish, since the rudder was too much
 out of the water to be of any great use for steering, and this manoeuvre
 eased the strain on the bulkhead, whose state, he expounded with stolid
 glibness, demanded the greatest care (exigeait les plus grands
 menagements). I could not help thinking that my new acquaintance must have
 had a voice in most of these arrangements: he looked a reliable officer,
 no longer very active, and he was seamanlike too, in a way, though as he
 sat there, with his thick fingers clasped lightly on his stomach, he
 reminded you of one of those snuffy, quiet village priests, into whose
 ears are poured the sins, the sufferings, the remorse of peasant
 generations, on whose faces the placid and simple expression is like a
 veil thrown over the mystery of pain and distress. He ought to have had a
 threadbare black soutane buttoned smoothly up to his ample chin, instead
 of a frock-coat with shoulder-straps and brass buttons. His broad bosom
 heaved regularly while he went on telling me that it had been the very
 devil of a job, as doubtless (sans doute) I could figure to myself in my
 quality of a seaman (en votre qualite de marin). At the end of the period
 he inclined his body slightly towards me, and, pursing his shaved lips,
 allowed the air to escape with a gentle hiss. "Luckily," he continued,
 "the sea was level like this table, and there was no more wind than there
 is here." . . . The place struck me as indeed intolerably stuffy, and very
 hot; my face burned as though I had been young enough to be embarrassed
 and blushing. They had directed their course, he pursued, to the nearest
 English port "naturellement," where their responsibility ceased, "Dieu
 merci." . . . He blew out his flat cheeks a little. . . . "Because, mind
 you (notez bien), all the time of towing we had two quartermasters
 stationed with axes by the hawsers, to cut us clear of our tow in case she
 . . ." He fluttered downwards his heavy eyelids, making his meaning as
 plain as possible. . . . "What would you! One does what one can (on fait
 ce qu'on peut)," and for a moment he managed to invest his ponderous
 immobility with an air of resignation. "Two quartermasters?thirty
 hours?always there. Two!" he repeated, lifting up his right hand a
 little, and exhibiting two fingers. This was absolutely the first gesture
 I saw him make. It gave me the opportunity to "note" a starred scar on the
 back of his hand?effect of a gunshot clearly; and, as if my sight
 had been made more acute by this discovery, I perceived also the seam of
 an old wound, beginning a little below the temple and going out of sight
 under the short grey hair at the side of his head?the graze of a
 spear or the cut of a sabre. He clasped his hands on his stomach again. "I
 remained on board that?that?my memory is going (s'en va). Ah!
 Patt-na. C'est bien ca. Patt-na. Merci. It is droll how one forgets. I
 stayed on that ship thirty hours. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You did!" I exclaimed. Still gazing at his hands, he pursed his lips a
 little, but this time made no hissing sound. "It was judged proper," he
 said, lifting his eyebrows dispassionately, "that one of the officers
 should remain to keep an eye open (pour ouvrir l'oeil)" . . . he sighed
 idly . . . "and for communicating by signals with the towing ship?do
 you see??and so on. For the rest, it was my opinion too. We made our
 boats ready to drop over?and I also on that ship took measures. . .
 . Enfin! One has done one's possible. It was a delicate position. Thirty
 hours! They prepared me some food. As for the wine?go and whistle
 for it?not a drop." In some extraordinary way, without any marked
 change in his inert attitude and in the placid expression of his face, he
 managed to convey the idea of profound disgust. "I?you know?when
 it comes to eating without my glass of wine?I am nowhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was afraid he would enlarge upon the grievance, for though he didn't
 stir a limb or twitch a feature, he made one aware how much he was
 irritated by the recollection. But he seemed to forget all about it. They
 delivered their charge to the "port authorities," as he expressed it. He
 was struck by the calmness with which it had been received. "One might
 have thought they had such a droll find (drole de trouvaille) brought them
 every day. You are extraordinary?you others," he commented, with his
 back propped against the wall, and looking himself as incapable of an
 emotional display as a sack of meal. There happened to be a man-of-war and
 an Indian Marine steamer in the harbour at the time, and he did not
 conceal his admiration of the efficient manner in which the boats of these
 two ships cleared the Patna of her passengers. Indeed his torpid demeanour
 concealed nothing: it had that mysterious, almost miraculous, power of
 producing striking effects by means impossible of detection which is the
 last word of the highest art. "Twenty-five minutes?watch in hand?twenty-five,
 no more." . . . He unclasped and clasped again his fingers without
 removing his hands from his stomach, and made it infinitely more effective
 than if he had thrown up his arms to heaven in amazement. . . . "All that
 lot (tout ce monde) on shore?with their little affairs?nobody
 left but a guard of seamen (marins de l'Etat) and that interesting corpse
 (cet interessant cadavre). Twenty-five minutes." . . . With downcast eyes
 and his head tilted slightly on one side he seemed to roll knowingly on
 his tongue the savour of a smart bit of work. He persuaded one without any
 further demonstration that his approval was eminently worth having, and
 resuming his hardly interrupted immobility, he went on to inform me that,
 being under orders to make the best of their way to Toulon, they left in
 two hours' time, "so that (de sorte que) there are many things in this
 incident of my life (dans cet episode de ma vie) which have remained
 obscure."'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 13
 </h2>
 <p>
 'After these words, and without a change of attitude, he, so to speak,
 submitted himself passively to a state of silence. I kept him company; and
 suddenly, but not abruptly, as if the appointed time had arrived for his
 moderate and husky voice to come out of his immobility, he pronounced,
 "Mon Dieu! how the time passes!" Nothing could have been more commonplace
 than this remark; but its utterance coincided for me with a moment of
 vision. It's extraordinary how we go through life with eyes half shut,
 with dull ears, with dormant thoughts. Perhaps it's just as well; and it
 may be that it is this very dullness that makes life to the incalculable
 majority so supportable and so welcome. Nevertheless, there can be but few
 of us who had never known one of these rare moments of awakening when we
 see, hear, understand ever so much?everything?in a flash?before
 we fall back again into our agreeable somnolence. I raised my eyes when he
 spoke, and I saw him as though I had never seen him before. I saw his chin
 sunk on his breast, the clumsy folds of his coat, his clasped hands, his
 motionless pose, so curiously suggestive of his having been simply left
 there. Time had passed indeed: it had overtaken him and gone ahead. It had
 left him hopelessly behind with a few poor gifts: the iron-grey hair, the
 heavy fatigue of the tanned face, two scars, a pair of tarnished
 shoulder-straps; one of those steady, reliable men who are the raw
 material of great reputations, one of those uncounted lives that are
 buried without drums and trumpets under the foundations of monumental
 successes. "I am now third lieutenant of the Victorieuse" (she was the
 flagship of the French Pacific squadron at the time), he said, detaching
 his shoulders from the wall a couple of inches to introduce himself. I
 bowed slightly on my side of the table, and told him I commanded a
 merchant vessel at present anchored in Rushcutters' Bay. He had "remarked"
 her,?a pretty little craft. He was very civil about it in his
 impassive way. I even fancy he went the length of tilting his head in
 compliment as he repeated, breathing visibly the while, "Ah, yes. A little
 craft painted black?very pretty?very pretty (tres coquet)."
 After a time he twisted his body slowly to face the glass door on our
 right. "A dull town (triste ville)," he observed, staring into the street.
 It was a brilliant day; a southerly buster was raging, and we could see
 the passers-by, men and women, buffeted by the wind on the sidewalks, the
 sunlit fronts of the houses across the road blurred by the tall whirls of
 dust. "I descended on shore," he said, "to stretch my legs a little, but .
 . ." He didn't finish, and sank into the depths of his repose. "Pray?tell
 me," he began, coming up ponderously, "what was there at the bottom of
 this affair?precisely (au juste)? It is curious. That dead man, for
 instance?and so on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"There were living men too," I said; "much more curious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"No doubt, no doubt," he agreed half audibly, then, as if after mature
 consideration, murmured, "Evidently." I made no difficulty in
 communicating to him what had interested me most in this affair. It seemed
 as though he had a right to know: hadn't he spent thirty hours on board
 the Patna?had he not taken the succession, so to speak, had he not
 done "his possible"? He listened to me, looking more priest-like than
 ever, and with what?probably on account of his downcast eyes?had
 the appearance of devout concentration. Once or twice he elevated his
 eyebrows (but without raising his eyelids), as one would say "The devil!"
 Once he calmly exclaimed, "Ah, bah!" under his breath, and when I had
 finished he pursed his lips in a deliberate way and emitted a sort of
 sorrowful whistle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In any one else it might have been an evidence of boredom, a sign of
 indifference; but he, in his occult way, managed to make his immobility
 appear profoundly responsive, and as full of valuable thoughts as an egg
 is of meat. What he said at last was nothing more than a "Very
 interesting," pronounced politely, and not much above a whisper. Before I
 got over my disappointment he added, but as if speaking to himself,
 "That's it. That <i>is</i> it." His chin seemed to sink lower on his
 breast, his body to weigh heavier on his seat. I was about to ask him what
 he meant, when a sort of preparatory tremor passed over his whole person,
 as a faint ripple may be seen upon stagnant water even before the wind is
 felt. "And so that poor young man ran away along with the others," he
 said, with grave tranquillity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I don't know what made me smile: it is the only genuine smile of mine I
 can remember in connection with Jim's affair. But somehow this simple
 statement of the matter sounded funny in French. . . . "S'est enfui avec
 les autres," had said the lieutenant. And suddenly I began to admire the
 discrimination of the man. He had made out the point at once: he did get
 hold of the only thing I cared about. I felt as though I were taking
 professional opinion on the case. His imperturbable and mature calmness
 was that of an expert in possession of the facts, and to whom one's
 perplexities are mere child's-play. "Ah! The young, the young," he said
 indulgently. "And after all, one does not die of it." "Die of what?" I
 asked swiftly. "Of being afraid." He elucidated his meaning and sipped his
 drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I perceived that the three last fingers of his wounded hand were stiff
 and could not move independently of each other, so that he took up his
 tumbler with an ungainly clutch. "One is always afraid. One may talk, but
 . . ." He put down the glass awkwardly. . . . "The fear, the fear?look
 you?it is always there." . . . He touched his breast near a brass
 button, on the very spot where Jim had given a thump to his own when
 protesting that there was nothing the matter with his heart. I suppose I
 made some sign of dissent, because he insisted, "Yes! yes! One talks, one
 talks; this is all very fine; but at the end of the reckoning one is no
 cleverer than the next man?and no more brave. Brave! This is always
 to be seen. I have rolled my hump (roule ma bosse)," he said, using the
 slang expression with imperturbable seriousness, "in all parts of the
 world; I have known brave men?famous ones! Allez!" . . . He drank
 carelessly. . . . "Brave?you conceive?in the Service?one
 has got to be?the trade demands it (le metier veut ca). Is it not
 so?" he appealed to me reasonably. "Eh bien! Each of them?I say each
 of them, if he were an honest man?bien entendu?would confess
 that there is a point?there is a point?for the best of us?there
 is somewhere a point when you let go everything (vous lachez tout). And
 you have got to live with that truth?do you see? Given a certain
 combination of circumstances, fear is sure to come. Abominable funk (un
 trac epouvantable). And even for those who do not believe this truth there
 is fear all the same?the fear of themselves. Absolutely so. Trust
 me. Yes. Yes. . . . At my age one knows what one is talking about?que
 diable!" . . . He had delivered himself of all this as immovably as though
 he had been the mouthpiece of abstract wisdom, but at this point he
 heightened the effect of detachment by beginning to twirl his thumbs
 slowly. "It's evident?parbleu!" he continued; "for, make up your
 mind as much as you like, even a simple headache or a fit of indigestion
 (un derangement d'estomac) is enough to . . . Take me, for instance?I
 have made my proofs. Eh bien! I, who am speaking to you, once . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He drained his glass and returned to his twirling. "No, no; one does not
 die of it," he pronounced finally, and when I found he did not mean to
 proceed with the personal anecdote, I was extremely disappointed; the more
 so as it was not the sort of story, you know, one could very well press
 him for. I sat silent, and he too, as if nothing could please him better.
 Even his thumbs were still now. Suddenly his lips began to move. "That is
 so," he resumed placidly. "Man is born a coward (L'homme est ne poltron).
 It is a difficulty?parbleu! It would be too easy other vise. But
 habit?habit?necessity?do you see??the eye of
 others?voila. One puts up with it. And then the example of others
 who are no better than yourself, and yet make good countenance. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His voice ceased.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"That young man?you will observe?had none of these
 inducements?at least at the moment," I remarked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He raised his eyebrows forgivingly: "I don't say; I don't say. The young
 man in question might have had the best dispositions?the best
 dispositions," he repeated, wheezing a little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I am glad to see you taking a lenient view," I said. "His own feeling in
 the matter was?ah!?hopeful, and . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The shuffle of his feet under the table interrupted me. He drew up his
 heavy eyelids. Drew up, I say?no other expression can describe the
 steady deliberation of the act?and at last was disclosed completely
 to me. I was confronted by two narrow grey circlets, like two tiny steel
 rings around the profound blackness of the pupils. The sharp glance,
 coming from that massive body, gave a notion of extreme efficiency, like a
 razor-edge on a battle-axe. "Pardon," he said punctiliously. His right
 hand went up, and he swayed forward. "Allow me . . . I contended that one
 may get on knowing very well that one's courage does not come of itself
 (ne vient pas tout seul). There's nothing much in that to get upset about.
 One truth the more ought not to make life impossible. . . . But the honour?the
 honour, monsieur! . . . The honour . . . that is real?that is! And
 what life may be worth when" . . . he got on his feet with a ponderous
 impetuosity, as a startled ox might scramble up from the grass . . . "when
 the honour is gone?ah ca! par exemple?I can offer no opinion.
 I can offer no opinion?because?monsieur?I know nothing
 of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I had risen too, and, trying to throw infinite politeness into our
 attitudes, we faced each other mutely, like two china dogs on a
 mantelpiece. Hang the fellow! he had pricked the bubble. The blight of
 futility that lies in wait for men's speeches had fallen upon our
 conversation, and made it a thing of empty sounds. "Very well," I said,
 with a disconcerted smile; "but couldn't it reduce itself to not being
 found out?" He made as if to retort readily, but when he spoke he had
 changed his mind. "This, monsieur, is too fine for me?much above me?I
 don't think about it." He bowed heavily over his cap, which he held before
 him by the peak, between the thumb and the forefinger of his wounded hand.
 I bowed too. We bowed together: we scraped our feet at each other with
 much ceremony, while a dirty specimen of a waiter looked on critically, as
 though he had paid for the performance. "Serviteur," said the Frenchman.
 Another scrape. "Monsieur" . . . "Monsieur." . . . The glass door swung
 behind his burly back. I saw the southerly buster get hold of him and
 drive him down wind with his hand to his head, his shoulders braced, and
 the tails of his coat blown hard against his legs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I sat down again alone and discouraged?discouraged about Jim's
 case. If you wonder that after more than three years it had preserved its
 actuality, you must know that I had seen him only very lately. I had come
 straight from Samarang, where I had loaded a cargo for Sydney: an utterly
 uninteresting bit of business,?what Charley here would call one of
 my rational transactions,?and in Samarang I had seen something of
 Jim. He was then working for De Jongh, on my recommendation. Water-clerk.
 "My representative afloat," as De Jongh called him. You can't imagine a
 mode of life more barren of consolation, less capable of being invested
 with a spark of glamour?unless it be the business of an insurance
 canvasser. Little Bob Stanton?Charley here knew him well?had
 gone through that experience. The same who got drowned afterwards trying
 to save a lady's-maid in the Sephora disaster. A case of collision on a
 hazy morning off the Spanish coast?you may remember. All the
 passengers had been packed tidily into the boats and shoved clear of the
 ship, when Bob sheered alongside again and scrambled back on deck to fetch
 that girl. How she had been left behind I can't make out; anyhow, she had
 gone completely crazy?wouldn't leave the ship?held to the rail
 like grim death. The wrestling-match could be seen plainly from the boats;
 but poor Bob was the shortest chief mate in the merchant service, and the
 woman stood five feet ten in her shoes and was as strong as a horse, I've
 been told. So it went on, pull devil, pull baker, the wretched girl
 screaming all the time, and Bob letting out a yell now and then to warn
 his boat to keep well clear of the ship. One of the hands told me, hiding
 a smile at the recollection, "It was for all the world, sir, like a
 naughty youngster fighting with his mother." The same old chap said that
 "At the last we could see that Mr. Stanton had given up hauling at the
 gal, and just stood by looking at her, watchful like. We thought
 afterwards he must've been reckoning that, maybe, the rush of water would
 tear her away from the rail by-and-by and give him a show to save her. We
 daren't come alongside for our life; and after a bit the old ship went
 down all on a sudden with a lurch to starboard?plop. The suck in was
 something awful. We never saw anything alive or dead come up." Poor Bob's
 spell of shore-life had been one of the complications of a love affair, I
 believe. He fondly hoped he had done with the sea for ever, and made sure
 he had got hold of all the bliss on earth, but it came to canvassing in
 the end. Some cousin of his in Liverpool put up to it. He used to tell us
 his experiences in that line. He made us laugh till we cried, and, not
 altogether displeased at the effect, undersized and bearded to the waist
 like a gnome, he would tiptoe amongst us and say, "It's all very well for
 you beggars to laugh, but my immortal soul was shrivelled down to the size
 of a parched pea after a week of that work." I don't know how Jim's soul
 accommodated itself to the new conditions of his life?I was kept too
 busy in getting him something to do that would keep body and soul together?but
 I am pretty certain his adventurous fancy was suffering all the pangs of
 starvation. It had certainly nothing to feed upon in this new calling. It
 was distressing to see him at it, though he tackled it with a stubborn
 serenity for which I must give him full credit. I kept my eye on his
 shabby plodding with a sort of notion that it was a punishment for the
 heroics of his fancy?an expiation for his craving after more glamour
 than he could carry. He had loved too well to imagine himself a glorious
 racehorse, and now he was condemned to toil without honour like a
 costermonger's donkey. He did it very well. He shut himself in, put his
 head down, said never a word. Very well; very well indeed?except for
 certain fantastic and violent outbreaks, on the deplorable occasions when
 the irrepressible Patna case cropped up. Unfortunately that scandal of the
 Eastern seas would not die out. And this is the reason why I could never
 feel I had done with Jim for good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I sat thinking of him after the French lieutenant had left, not, however,
 in connection with De Jongh's cool and gloomy backshop, where we had
 hurriedly shaken hands not very long ago, but as I had seen him years
 before in the last flickers of the candle, alone with me in the long
 gallery of the Malabar House, with the chill and the darkness of the night
 at his back. The respectable sword of his country's law was suspended over
 his head. To-morrow?or was it to-day? (midnight had slipped by long
 before we parted)?the marble-faced police magistrate, after
 distributing fines and terms of imprisonment in the assault-and-battery
 case, would take up the awful weapon and smite his bowed neck. Our
 communion in the night was uncommonly like a last vigil with a condemned
 man. He was guilty too. He was guilty?as I had told myself
 repeatedly, guilty and done for; nevertheless, I wished to spare him the
 mere detail of a formal execution. I don't pretend to explain the reasons
 of my desire?I don't think I could; but if you haven't got a sort of
 notion by this time, then I must have been very obscure in my narrative,
 or you too sleepy to seize upon the sense of my words. I don't defend my
 morality. There was no morality in the impulse which induced me to lay
 before him Brierly's plan of evasion?I may call it?in all its
 primitive simplicity. There were the rupees?absolutely ready in my
 pocket and very much at his service. Oh! a loan; a loan of course?and
 if an introduction to a man (in Rangoon) who could put some work in his
 way . . . Why! with the greatest pleasure. I had pen, ink, and paper in my
 room on the first floor And even while I was speaking I was impatient to
 begin the letter?day, month, year, 2.30 A.M. . . . for the sake of
 our old friendship I ask you to put some work in the way of Mr. James
 So-and-so, in whom, &amp;c., &amp;c. . . . I was even ready to write in
 that strain about him. If he had not enlisted my sympathies he had done
 better for himself?he had gone to the very fount and origin of that
 sentiment he had reached the secret sensibility of my egoism. I am
 concealing nothing from you, because were I to do so my action would
 appear more unintelligible than any man's action has the right to be, and?in
 the second place?to-morrow you will forget my sincerity along with
 the other lessons of the past. In this transaction, to speak grossly and
 precisely, I was the irreproachable man; but the subtle intentions of my
 immorality were defeated by the moral simplicity of the criminal. No doubt
 he was selfish too, but his selfishness had a higher origin, a more lofty
 aim. I discovered that, say what I would, he was eager to go through the
 ceremony of execution, and I didn't say much, for I felt that in argument
 his youth would tell against me heavily: he believed where I had already
 ceased to doubt. There was something fine in the wildness of his
 unexpressed, hardly formulated hope. "Clear out! Couldn't think of it," he
 said, with a shake of the head. "I make you an offer for which I neither
 demand nor expect any sort of gratitude," I said; "you shall repay the
 money when convenient, and . . ." "Awfully good of you," he muttered
 without looking up. I watched him narrowly: the future must have appeared
 horribly uncertain to him; but he did not falter, as though indeed there
 had been nothing wrong with his heart. I felt angry?not for the
 first time that night. "The whole wretched business," I said, "is bitter
 enough, I should think, for a man of your kind . . ." "It is, it is," he
 whispered twice, with his eyes fixed on the floor. It was heartrending. He
 towered above the light, and I could see the down on his cheek, the colour
 mantling warm under the smooth skin of his face. Believe me or not, I say
 it was outrageously heartrending. It provoked me to brutality. "Yes," I
 said; "and allow me to confess that I am totally unable to imagine what
 advantage you can expect from this licking of the dregs." "Advantage!" he
 murmured out of his stillness. "I am dashed if I do," I said, enraged.
 "I've been trying to tell you all there is in it," he went on slowly, as
 if meditating something unanswerable. "But after all, it is <i>my</i>
 trouble." I opened my mouth to retort, and discovered suddenly that I'd
 lost all confidence in myself; and it was as if he too had given me up,
 for he mumbled like a man thinking half aloud. "Went away . . . went into
 hospitals. . . . Not one of them would face it. . . . They! . . ." He
 moved his hand slightly to imply disdain. "But I've got to get over this
 thing, and I mustn't shirk any of it or . . . I won't shirk any of it." He
 was silent. He gazed as though he had been haunted. His unconscious face
 reflected the passing expressions of scorn, of despair, of resolution?reflected
 them in turn, as a magic mirror would reflect the gliding passage of
 unearthly shapes. He lived surrounded by deceitful ghosts, by austere
 shades. "Oh! nonsense, my dear fellow," I began. He had a movement of
 impatience. "You don't seem to understand," he said incisively; then
 looking at me without a wink, "I may have jumped, but I don't run away."
 "I meant no offence," I said; and added stupidly, "Better men than you
 have found it expedient to run, at times." He coloured all over, while in
 my confusion I half-choked myself with my own tongue. "Perhaps so," he
 said at last, "I am not good enough; I can't afford it. I am bound to
 fight this thing down?I am fighting it now." I got out of my chair
 and felt stiff all over. The silence was embarrassing, and to put an end
 to it I imagined nothing better but to remark, "I had no idea it was so
 late," in an airy tone. . . . "I dare say you have had enough of this," he
 said brusquely: "and to tell you the truth"?he began to look round
 for his hat?"so have I."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Well! he had refused this unique offer. He had struck aside my helping
 hand; he was ready to go now, and beyond the balustrade the night seemed
 to wait for him very still, as though he had been marked down for its
 prey. I heard his voice. "Ah! here it is." He had found his hat. For a few
 seconds we hung in the wind. "What will you do after?after . . ." I
 asked very low. "Go to the dogs as likely as not," he answered in a gruff
 mutter. I had recovered my wits in a measure, and judged best to take it
 lightly. "Pray remember," I said, "that I should like very much to see you
 again before you go." "I don't know what's to prevent you. The damned
 thing won't make me invisible," he said with intense bitterness,?"no
 such luck." And then at the moment of taking leave he treated me to a
 ghastly muddle of dubious stammers and movements, to an awful display of
 hesitations. God forgive him?me! He had taken it into his fanciful
 head that I was likely to make some difficulty as to shaking hands. It was
 too awful for words. I believe I shouted suddenly at him as you would
 bellow to a man you saw about to walk over a cliff; I remember our voices
 being raised, the appearance of a miserable grin on his face, a crushing
 clutch on my hand, a nervous laugh. The candle spluttered out, and the
 thing was over at last, with a groan that floated up to me in the dark. He
 got himself away somehow. The night swallowed his form. He was a horrible
 bungler. Horrible. I heard the quick crunch-crunch of the gravel under his
 boots. He was running. Absolutely running, with nowhere to go to. And he
 was not yet four-and-twenty.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 14
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I slept little, hurried over my breakfast, and after a slight hesitation
 gave up my early morning visit to my ship. It was really very wrong of me,
 because, though my chief mate was an excellent man all round, he was the
 victim of such black imaginings that if he did not get a letter from his
 wife at the expected time he would go quite distracted with rage and
 jealousy, lose all grip on the work, quarrel with all hands, and either
 weep in his cabin or develop such a ferocity of temper as all but drove
 the crew to the verge of mutiny. The thing had always seemed inexplicable
 to me: they had been married thirteen years; I had a glimpse of her once,
 and, honestly, I couldn't conceive a man abandoned enough to plunge into
 sin for the sake of such an unattractive person. I don't know whether I
 have not done wrong by refraining from putting that view before poor
 Selvin: the man made a little hell on earth for himself, and I also
 suffered indirectly, but some sort of, no doubt, false delicacy prevented
 me. The marital relations of seamen would make an interesting subject, and
 I could tell you instances. . . . However, this is not the place, nor the
 time, and we are concerned with Jim?who was unmarried. If his
 imaginative conscience or his pride; if all the extravagant ghosts and
 austere shades that were the disastrous familiars of his youth would not
 let him run away from the block, I, who of course can't be suspected of
 such familiars, was irresistibly impelled to go and see his head roll off.
 I wended my way towards the court. I didn't hope to be very much impressed
 or edified, or interested or even frightened?though, as long as
 there is any life before one, a jolly good fright now and then is a
 salutary discipline. But neither did I expect to be so awfully depressed.
 The bitterness of his punishment was in its chill and mean atmosphere. The
 real significance of crime is in its being a breach of faith with the
 community of mankind, and from that point of view he was no mean traitor,
 but his execution was a hole-and-corner affair. There was no high
 scaffolding, no scarlet cloth (did they have scarlet cloth on Tower Hill?
 They should have had), no awe-stricken multitude to be horrified at his
 guilt and be moved to tears at his fate?no air of sombre
 retribution. There was, as I walked along, the clear sunshine, a
 brilliance too passionate to be consoling, the streets full of jumbled
 bits of colour like a damaged kaleidoscope: yellow, green, blue, dazzling
 white, the brown nudity of an undraped shoulder, a bullock-cart with a red
 canopy, a company of native infantry in a drab body with dark heads
 marching in dusty laced boots, a native policeman in a sombre uniform of
 scanty cut and belted in patent leather, who looked up at me with
 orientally pitiful eyes as though his migrating spirit were suffering
 exceedingly from that unforeseen?what d'ye call 'em??avatar?incarnation.
 Under the shade of a lonely tree in the courtyard, the villagers connected
 with the assault case sat in a picturesque group, looking like a
 chromo-lithograph of a camp in a book of Eastern travel. One missed the
 obligatory thread of smoke in the foreground and the pack-animals grazing.
 A blank yellow wall rose behind overtopping the tree, reflecting the
 glare. The court-room was sombre, seemed more vast. High up in the dim
 space the punkahs were swaying short to and fro, to and fro. Here and
 there a draped figure, dwarfed by the bare walls, remained without
 stirring amongst the rows of empty benches, as if absorbed in pious
 meditation. The plaintiff, who had been beaten,?an obese
 chocolate-coloured man with shaved head, one fat breast bare and a bright
 yellow caste-mark above the bridge of his nose,?sat in pompous
 immobility: only his eyes glittered, rolling in the gloom, and the
 nostrils dilated and collapsed violently as he breathed. Brierly dropped
 into his seat looking done up, as though he had spent the night in
 sprinting on a cinder-track. The pious sailing-ship skipper appeared
 excited and made uneasy movements, as if restraining with difficulty an
 impulse to stand up and exhort us earnestly to prayer and repentance. The
 head of the magistrate, delicately pale under the neatly arranged hair,
 resembled the head of a hopeless invalid after he had been washed and
 brushed and propped up in bed. He moved aside the vase of flowers?a
 bunch of purple with a few pink blossoms on long stalks?and seizing
 in both hands a long sheet of bluish paper, ran his eye over it, propped
 his forearms on the edge of the desk, and began to read aloud in an even,
 distinct, and careless voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'By Jove! For all my foolishness about scaffolds and heads rolling off?I
 assure you it was infinitely worse than a beheading. A heavy sense of
 finality brooded over all this, unrelieved by the hope of rest and safety
 following the fall of the axe. These proceedings had all the cold
 vengefulness of a death-sentence, and the cruelty of a sentence of exile.
 This is how I looked at it that morning?and even now I seem to see
 an undeniable vestige of truth in that exaggerated view of a common
 occurrence. You may imagine how strongly I felt this at the time. Perhaps
 it is for that reason that I could not bring myself to admit the finality.
 The thing was always with me, I was always eager to take opinion on it, as
 though it had not been practically settled: individual opinion?international
 opinion?by Jove! That Frenchman's, for instance. His own country's
 pronouncement was uttered in the passionless and definite phraseology a
 machine would use, if machines could speak. The head of the magistrate was
 half hidden by the paper, his brow was like alabaster.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There were several questions before the court. The first as to whether
 the ship was in every respect fit and seaworthy for the voyage. The court
 found she was not. The next point, I remember, was, whether up to the time
 of the accident the ship had been navigated with proper and seamanlike
 care. They said Yes to that, goodness knows why, and then they declared
 that there was no evidence to show the exact cause of the accident. A
 floating derelict probably. I myself remember that a Norwegian barque
 bound out with a cargo of pitch-pine had been given up as missing about
 that time, and it was just the sort of craft that would capsize in a
 squall and float bottom up for months?a kind of maritime ghoul on
 the prowl to kill ships in the dark. Such wandering corpses are common
 enough in the North Atlantic, which is haunted by all the terrors of the
 sea,?fogs, icebergs, dead ships bent upon mischief, and long
 sinister gales that fasten upon one like a vampire till all the strength
 and the spirit and even hope are gone, and one feels like the empty shell
 of a man. But there?in those seas?the incident was rare enough
 to resemble a special arrangement of a malevolent providence, which,
 unless it had for its object the killing of a donkeyman and the bringing
 of worse than death upon Jim, appeared an utterly aimless piece of
 devilry. This view occurring to me took off my attention. For a time I was
 aware of the magistrate's voice as a sound merely; but in a moment it
 shaped itself into distinct words . . . "in utter disregard of their plain
 duty," it said. The next sentence escaped me somehow, and then . . .
 "abandoning in the moment of danger the lives and property confided to
 their charge" . . . went on the voice evenly, and stopped. A pair of eyes
 under the white forehead shot darkly a glance above the edge of the paper.
 I looked for Jim hurriedly, as though I had expected him to disappear. He
 was very still?but he was there. He sat pink and fair and extremely
 attentive. "Therefore, . . ." began the voice emphatically. He stared with
 parted lips, hanging upon the words of the man behind the desk. These came
 out into the stillness wafted on the wind made by the punkahs, and I,
 watching for their effect upon him, caught only the fragments of official
 language. . . . "The Court . . . Gustav So-and-so . . . master . . .
 native of Germany . . . James So-and-so . . . mate . . . certificates
 cancelled." A silence fell. The magistrate had dropped the paper, and,
 leaning sideways on the arm of his chair, began to talk with Brierly
 easily. People started to move out; others were pushing in, and I also
 made for the door. Outside I stood still, and when Jim passed me on his
 way to the gate, I caught at his arm and detained him. The look he gave
 discomposed me, as though I had been responsible for his state he looked
 at me as if I had been the embodied evil of life. "It's all over," I
 stammered. "Yes," he said thickly. "And now let no man . . ." He jerked
 his arm out of my grasp. I watched his back as he went away. It was a long
 street, and he remained in sight for some time. He walked rather slow, and
 straddling his legs a little, as if he had found it difficult to keep a
 straight line. Just before I lost him I fancied he staggered a bit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Man overboard," said a deep voice behind me. Turning round, I saw a
 fellow I knew slightly, a West Australian; Chester was his name. He, too,
 had been looking after Jim. He was a man with an immense girth of chest, a
 rugged, clean-shaved face of mahogany colour, and two blunt tufts of
 iron-grey, thick, wiry hairs on his upper lip. He had been pearler,
 wrecker, trader, whaler too, I believe; in his own words?anything
 and everything a man may be at sea, but a pirate. The Pacific, north and
 south, was his proper hunting-ground; but he had wandered so far afield
 looking for a cheap steamer to buy. Lately he had discovered?so he
 said?a guano island somewhere, but its approaches were dangerous,
 and the anchorage, such as it was, could not be considered safe, to say
 the least of it. "As good as a gold-mine," he would exclaim. "Right bang
 in the middle of the Walpole Reefs, and if it's true enough that you can
 get no holding-ground anywhere in less than forty fathom, then what of
 that? There are the hurricanes, too. But it's a first-rate thing. As good
 as a gold-mine?better! Yet there's not a fool of them that will see
 it. I can't get a skipper or a shipowner to go near the place. So I made
 up my mind to cart the blessed stuff myself." . . . This was what he
 required a steamer for, and I knew he was just then negotiating
 enthusiastically with a Parsee firm for an old, brig-rigged,
 sea-anachronism of ninety horse-power. We had met and spoken together
 several times. He looked knowingly after Jim. "Takes it to heart?" he
 asked scornfully. "Very much," I said. "Then he's no good," he opined.
 "What's all the to-do about? A bit of ass's skin. That never yet made a
 man. You must see things exactly as they are?if you don't, you may
 just as well give in at once. You will never do anything in this world.
 Look at me. I made it a practice never to take anything to heart." "Yes,"
 I said, "you see things as they are." "I wish I could see my partner
 coming along, that's what I wish to see," he said. "Know my partner? Old
 Robinson. Yes; <i>the</i> Robinson. Don't <i>you</i> know? The notorious
 Robinson. The man who smuggled more opium and bagged more seals in his
 time than any loose Johnny now alive. They say he used to board the
 sealing-schooners up Alaska way when the fog was so thick that the Lord
 God, He alone, could tell one man from another. Holy-Terror Robinson.
 That's the man. He is with me in that guano thing. The best chance he ever
 came across in his life." He put his lips to my ear. "Cannibal??well,
 they used to give him the name years and years ago. You remember the
 story? A shipwreck on the west side of Stewart Island; that's right; seven
 of them got ashore, and it seems they did not get on very well together.
 Some men are too cantankerous for anything?don't know how to make
 the best of a bad job?don't see things as they are?as they <i>are</i>,
 my boy! And then what's the consequence? Obvious! Trouble, trouble; as
 likely as not a knock on the head; and serve 'em right too. That sort is
 the most useful when it's dead. The story goes that a boat of Her
 Majesty's ship Wolverine found him kneeling on the kelp, naked as the day
 he was born, and chanting some psalm-tune or other; light snow was falling
 at the time. He waited till the boat was an oar's length from the shore,
 and then up and away. They chased him for an hour up and down the
 boulders, till a marihe flung a stone that took him behind the ear
 providentially and knocked him senseless. Alone? Of course. But that's
 like that tale of sealing-schooners; the Lord God knows the right and the
 wrong of that story. The cutter did not investigate much. They wrapped him
 in a boat-cloak and took him off as quick as they could, with a dark night
 coming on, the weather threatening, and the ship firing recall guns every
 five minutes. Three weeks afterwards he was as well as ever. He didn't
 allow any fuss that was made on shore to upset him; he just shut his lips
 tight, and let people screech. It was bad enough to have lost his ship,
 and all he was worth besides, without paying attention to the hard names
 they called him. That's the man for me." He lifted his arm for a signal to
 some one down the street. "He's got a little money, so I had to let him
 into my thing. Had to! It would have been sinful to throw away such a
 find, and I was cleaned out myself. It cut me to the quick, but I could
 see the matter just as it was, and if I <i>must</i> share?thinks I?with
 any man, then give me Robinson. I left him at breakfast in the hotel to
 come to court, because I've an idea. . . . Ah! Good morning, Captain
 Robinson. . . . Friend of mine, Captain Robinson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'An emaciated patriarch in a suit of white drill, a solah topi with a
 green-lined rim on a head trembling with age, joined us after crossing the
 street in a trotting shuffle, and stood propped with both hands on the
 handle of an umbrella. A white beard with amber streaks hung lumpily down
 to his waist. He blinked his creased eyelids at me in a bewildered way.
 "How do you do? how do you do?" he piped amiably, and tottered. "A little
 deaf," said Chester aside. "Did you drag him over six thousand miles to
 get a cheap steamer?" I asked. "I would have taken him twice round the
 world as soon as look at him," said Chester with immense energy. "The
 steamer will be the making of us, my lad. Is it my fault that every
 skipper and shipowner in the whole of blessed Australasia turns out a
 blamed fool? Once I talked for three hours to a man in Auckland. 'Send a
 ship,' I said, 'send a ship. I'll give you half of the first cargo for
 yourself, free gratis for nothing?just to make a good start.' Says
 he, 'I wouldn't do it if there was no other place on earth to send a ship
 to.' Perfect ass, of course. Rocks, currents, no anchorage, sheer cliff to
 lay to, no insurance company would take the risk, didn't see how he could
 get loaded under three years. Ass! I nearly went on my knees to him. 'But
 look at the thing as it is,' says I. 'Damn rocks and hurricanes. Look at
 it as it is. There's guano there Queensland sugar-planters would fight for?fight
 for on the quay, I tell you.' . . . What can you do with a fool? . . .
 'That's one of your little jokes, Chester,' he says. . . . Joke! I could
 have wept. Ask Captain Robinson here. . . . And there was another
 shipowning fellow?a fat chap in a white waistcoat in Wellington, who
 seemed to think I was up to some swindle or other. 'I don't know what sort
 of fool you're looking for,' he says, 'but I am busy just now. Good
 morning.' I longed to take him in my two hands and smash him through the
 window of his own office. But I didn't. I was as mild as a curate. 'Think
 of it,' says I. '<i>Do</i> think it over. I'll call to-morrow.' He grunted
 something about being 'out all day.' On the stairs I felt ready to beat my
 head against the wall from vexation. Captain Robinson here can tell you.
 It was awful to think of all that lovely stuff lying waste under the sun?stuff
 that would send the sugar-cane shooting sky-high. The making of
 Queensland! The making of Queensland! And in Brisbane, where I went to
 have a last try, they gave me the name of a lunatic. Idiots! The only
 sensible man I came across was the cabman who drove me about. A
 broken-down swell he was, I fancy. Hey! Captain Robinson? You remember I
 told you about my cabby in Brisbane?don't you? The chap had a
 wonderful eye for things. He saw it all in a jiffy. It was a real pleasure
 to talk with him. One evening after a devil of a day amongst shipowners I
 felt so bad that, says I, 'I must get drunk. Come along; I must get drunk,
 or I'll go mad.' 'I am your man,' he says; 'go ahead.' I don't know what I
 would have done without him. Hey! Captain Robinson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He poked the ribs of his partner. "He! he! he!" laughed the Ancient,
 looked aimlessly down the street, then peered at me doubtfully with sad,
 dim pupils. . . . "He! he! he!" . . . He leaned heavier on the umbrella,
 and dropped his gaze on the ground. I needn't tell you I had tried to get
 away several times, but Chester had foiled every attempt by simply
 catching hold of my coat. "One minute. I've a notion." "What's your
 infernal notion?" I exploded at last. "If you think I am going in with you
 . . ." "No, no, my boy. Too late, if you wanted ever so much. We've got a
 steamer." "You've got the ghost of a steamer," I said. "Good enough for a
 start?there's no superior nonsense about us. Is there, Captain
 Robinson?" "No! no! no!" croaked the old man without lifting his eyes, and
 the senile tremble of his head became almost fierce with determination. "I
 understand you know that young chap," said Chester, with a nod at the
 street from which Jim had disappeared long ago. "He's been having grub
 with you in the Malabar last night?so I was told."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I said that was true, and after remarking that he too liked to live well
 and in style, only that, for the present, he had to be saving of every
 penny?"none too many for the business! Isn't that so, Captain
 Robinson?"?he squared his shoulders and stroked his dumpy moustache,
 while the notorious Robinson, coughing at his side, clung more than ever
 to the handle of the umbrella, and seemed ready to subside passively into
 a heap of old bones. "You see, the old chap has all the money," whispered
 Chester confidentially. "I've been cleaned out trying to engineer the
 dratted thing. But wait a bit, wait a bit. The good time is coming." . . .
 He seemed suddenly astonished at the signs of impatience I gave. "Oh,
 crakee!" he cried; "I am telling you of the biggest thing that ever was,
 and you . . ." "I have an appointment," I pleaded mildly. "What of that?"
 he asked with genuine surprise; "let it wait." "That's exactly what I am
 doing now," I remarked; "hadn't you better tell me what it is you want?"
 "Buy twenty hotels like that," he growled to himself; "and every joker
 boarding in them too?twenty times over." He lifted his head smartly
 "I want that young chap." "I don't understand," I said. "He's no good, is
 he?" said Chester crisply. "I know nothing about it," I protested. "Why,
 you told me yourself he was taking it to heart," argued Chester. "Well, in
 my opinion a chap who . . . Anyhow, he can't be much good; but then you
 see I am on the look-out for somebody, and I've just got a thing that will
 suit him. I'll give him a job on my island." He nodded significantly. "I'm
 going to dump forty coolies there?if I've to steal 'em. Somebody
 must work the stuff. Oh! I mean to act square: wooden shed,
 corrugated-iron roof?I know a man in Hobart who will take my bill at
 six months for the materials. I do. Honour bright. Then there's the
 water-supply. I'll have to fly round and get somebody to trust me for
 half-a-dozen second-hand iron tanks. Catch rain-water, hey? Let him take
 charge. Make him supreme boss over the coolies. Good idea, isn't it? What
 do you say?" "There are whole years when not a drop of rain falls on
 Walpole," I said, too amazed to laugh. He bit his lip and seemed bothered.
 "Oh, well, I will fix up something for them?or land a supply. Hang
 it all! That's not the question."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I said nothing. I had a rapid vision of Jim perched on a shadowless rock,
 up to his knees in guano, with the screams of sea-birds in his ears, the
 incandescent ball of the sun above his head; the empty sky and the empty
 ocean all a-quiver, simmering together in the heat as far as the eye could
 reach. "I wouldn't advise my worst enemy . . ." I began. "What's the
 matter with you?" cried Chester; "I mean to give him a good screw?that
 is, as soon as the thing is set going, of course. It's as easy as falling
 off a log. Simply nothing to do; two six-shooters in his belt . . . Surely
 he wouldn't be afraid of anything forty coolies could do?with two
 six-shooters and he the only armed man too! It's much better than it
 looks. I want you to help me to talk him over." "No!" I shouted. Old
 Robinson lifted his bleared eyes dismally for a moment, Chester looked at
 me with infinite contempt. "So you wouldn't advise him?" he uttered
 slowly. "Certainly not," I answered, as indignant as though he had
 requested me to help murder somebody; "moreover, I am sure he wouldn't. He
 is badly cut up, but he isn't mad as far as I know." "He is no earthly
 good for anything," Chester mused aloud. "He would just have done for me.
 If you only could see a thing as it is, you would see it's the very thing
 for him. And besides . . . Why! it's the most splendid, sure chance . . ."
 He got angry suddenly. "I must have a man. There! . . ." He stamped his
 foot and smiled unpleasantly. "Anyhow, I could guarantee the island
 wouldn't sink under him?and I believe he is a bit particular on that
 point." "Good morning," I said curtly. He looked at me as though I had
 been an incomprehensible fool. . . . "Must be moving, Captain Robinson,"
 he yelled suddenly into the old man's ear. "These Parsee Johnnies are
 waiting for us to clinch the bargain." He took his partner under the arm
 with a firm grip, swung him round, and, unexpectedly, leered at me over
 his shoulder. "I was trying to do him a kindness," he asserted, with an
 air and tone that made my blood boil. "Thank you for nothing?in his
 name," I rejoined. "Oh! you are devilish smart," he sneered; "but you are
 like the rest of them. Too much in the clouds. See what you will do with
 him." "I don't know that I want to do anything with him." "Don't you?" he
 spluttered; his grey moustache bristled with anger, and by his side the
 notorious Robinson, propped on the umbrella, stood with his back to me, as
 patient and still as a worn-out cab-horse. "I haven't found a guano
 island," I said. "It's my belief you wouldn't know one if you were led
 right up to it by the hand," he riposted quickly; "and in this world
 you've got to see a thing first, before you can make use of it. Got to see
 it through and through at that, neither more nor less." "And get others to
 see it, too," I insinuated, with a glance at the bowed back by his side.
 Chester snorted at me. "His eyes are right enough?don't you worry.
 He ain't a puppy." "Oh, dear, no!" I said. "Come along, Captain Robinson,"
 he shouted, with a sort of bullying deference under the rim of the old
 man's hat; the Holy Terror gave a submissive little jump. The ghost of a
 steamer was waiting for them, Fortune on that fair isle! They made a
 curious pair of Argonauts. Chester strode on leisurely, well set up,
 portly, and of conquering mien; the other, long, wasted, drooping, and
 hooked to his arm, shuffled his withered shanks with desperate haste.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 15
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I did not start in search of Jim at once, only because I had really an
 appointment which I could not neglect. Then, as ill-luck would have it, in
 my agent's office I was fastened upon by a fellow fresh from Madagascar
 with a little scheme for a wonderful piece of business. It had something
 to do with cattle and cartridges and a Prince Ravonalo something; but the
 pivot of the whole affair was the stupidity of some admiral?Admiral
 Pierre, I think. Everything turned on that, and the chap couldn't find
 words strong enough to express his confidence. He had globular eyes
 starting out of his head with a fishy glitter, bumps on his forehead, and
 wore his long hair brushed back without a parting. He had a favourite
 phrase which he kept on repeating triumphantly, "The minimum of risk with
 the maximum of profit is my motto. What?" He made my head ache, spoiled my
 tiffin, but got his own out of me all right; and as soon as I had shaken
 him off, I made straight for the water-side. I caught sight of Jim leaning
 over the parapet of the quay. Three native boatmen quarrelling over five
 annas were making an awful row at his elbow. He didn't hear me come up,
 but spun round as if the slight contact of my finger had released a catch.
 "I was looking," he stammered. I don't remember what I said, not much
 anyhow, but he made no difficulty in following me to the hotel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He followed me as manageable as a little child, with an obedient air,
 with no sort of manifestation, rather as though he had been waiting for me
 there to come along and carry him off. I need not have been so surprised
 as I was at his tractability. On all the round earth, which to some seems
 so big and that others affect to consider as rather smaller than a
 mustard-seed, he had no place where he could?what shall I say??where
 he could withdraw. That's it! Withdraw?be alone with his loneliness.
 He walked by my side very calm, glancing here and there, and once turned
 his head to look after a Sidiboy fireman in a cutaway coat and yellowish
 trousers, whose black face had silky gleams like a lump of anthracite
 coal. I doubt, however, whether he saw anything, or even remained all the
 time aware of my companionship, because if I had not edged him to the left
 here, or pulled him to the right there, I believe he would have gone
 straight before him in any direction till stopped by a wall or some other
 obstacle. I steered him into my bedroom, and sat down at once to write
 letters. This was the only place in the world (unless, perhaps, the
 Walpole Reef?but that was not so handy) where he could have it out
 with himself without being bothered by the rest of the universe. The
 damned thing?as he had expressed it?had not made him
 invisible, but I behaved exactly as though he were. No sooner in my chair
 I bent over my writing-desk like a medieval scribe, and, but for the
 movement of the hand holding the pen, remained anxiously quiet. I can't
 say I was frightened; but I certainly kept as still as if there had been
 something dangerous in the room, that at the first hint of a movement on
 my part would be provoked to pounce upon me. There was not much in the
 room?you know how these bedrooms are?a sort of four-poster
 bedstead under a mosquito-net, two or three chairs, the table I was
 writing at, a bare floor. A glass door opened on an upstairs verandah, and
 he stood with his face to it, having a hard time with all possible
 privacy. Dusk fell; I lit a candle with the greatest economy of movement
 and as much prudence as though it were an illegal proceeding. There is no
 doubt that he had a very hard time of it, and so had I, even to the point,
 I must own, of wishing him to the devil, or on Walpole Reef at least. It
 occurred to me once or twice that, after all, Chester was, perhaps, the
 man to deal effectively with such a disaster. That strange idealist had
 found a practical use for it at once?unerringly, as it were. It was
 enough to make one suspect that, maybe, he really could see the true
 aspect of things that appeared mysterious or utterly hopeless to less
 imaginative persons. I wrote and wrote; I liquidated all the arrears of my
 correspondence, and then went on writing to people who had no reason
 whatever to expect from me a gossipy letter about nothing at all. At times
 I stole a sidelong glance. He was rooted to the spot, but convulsive
 shudders ran down his back; his shoulders would heave suddenly. He was
 fighting, he was fighting?mostly for his breath, as it seemed. The
 massive shadows, cast all one way from the straight flame of the candle,
 seemed possessed of gloomy consciousness; the immobility of the furniture
 had to my furtive eye an air of attention. I was becoming fanciful in the
 midst of my industrious scribbling; and though, when the scratching of my
 pen stopped for a moment, there was complete silence and stillness in the
 room, I suffered from that profound disturbance and confusion of thought
 which is caused by a violent and menacing uproar?of a heavy gale at
 sea, for instance. Some of you may know what I mean: that mingled anxiety,
 distress, and irritation with a sort of craven feeling creeping in?not
 pleasant to acknowledge, but which gives a quite special merit to one's
 endurance. I don't claim any merit for standing the stress of Jim's
 emotions; I could take refuge in the letters; I could have written to
 strangers if necessary. Suddenly, as I was taking up a fresh sheet of
 notepaper, I heard a low sound, the first sound that, since we had been
 shut up together, had come to my ears in the dim stillness of the room. I
 remained with my head down, with my hand arrested. Those who have kept
 vigil by a sick-bed have heard such faint sounds in the stillness of the
 night watches, sounds wrung from a racked body, from a weary soul. He
 pushed the glass door with such force that all the panes rang: he stepped
 out, and I held my breath, straining my ears without knowing what else I
 expected to hear. He was really taking too much to heart an empty
 formality which to Chester's rigorous criticism seemed unworthy the notice
 of a man who could see things as they were. An empty formality; a piece of
 parchment. Well, well. As to an inaccessible guano deposit, that was
 another story altogether. One could intelligibly break one's heart over
 that. A feeble burst of many voices mingled with the tinkle of silver and
 glass floated up from the dining-room below; through the open door the
 outer edge of the light from my candle fell on his back faintly; beyond
 all was black; he stood on the brink of a vast obscurity, like a lonely
 figure by the shore of a sombre and hopeless ocean. There was the Walpole
 Reef in it?to be sure?a speck in the dark void, a straw for
 the drowning man. My compassion for him took the shape of the thought that
 I wouldn't have liked his people to see him at that moment. I found it
 trying myself. His back was no longer shaken by his gasps; he stood
 straight as an arrow, faintly visible and still; and the meaning of this
 stillness sank to the bottom of my soul like lead into the water, and made
 it so heavy that for a second I wished heartily that the only course left
 open for me was to pay for his funeral. Even the law had done with him. To
 bury him would have been such an easy kindness! It would have been so much
 in accordance with the wisdom of life, which consists in putting out of
 sight all the reminders of our folly, of our weakness, of our mortality;
 all that makes against our efficiency?the memory of our failures,
 the hints of our undying fears, the bodies of our dead friends. Perhaps he
 did take it too much to heart. And if so then?Chester's offer. . . .
 At this point I took up a fresh sheet and began to write resolutely. There
 was nothing but myself between him and the dark ocean. I had a sense of
 responsibility. If I spoke, would that motionless and suffering youth leap
 into the obscurity?clutch at the straw? I found out how difficult it
 may be sometimes to make a sound. There is a weird power in a spoken word.
 And why the devil not? I was asking myself persistently while I drove on
 with my writing. All at once, on the blank page, under the very point of
 the pen, the two figures of Chester and his antique partner, very distinct
 and complete, would dodge into view with stride and gestures, as if
 reproduced in the field of some optical toy. I would watch them for a
 while. No! They were too phantasmal and extravagant to enter into any
 one's fate. And a word carries far?very far?deals destruction
 through time as the bullets go flying through space. I said nothing; and
 he, out there with his back to the light, as if bound and gagged by all
 the invisible foes of man, made no stir and made no sound.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 16
 </h2>
 <p>
 'The time was coming when I should see him loved, trusted, admired, with a
 legend of strength and prowess forming round his name as though he had
 been the stuff of a hero. It's true?I assure you; as true as I'm
 sitting here talking about him in vain. He, on his side, had that faculty
 of beholding at a hint the face of his desire and the shape of his dream,
 without which the earth would know no lover and no adventurer. He captured
 much honour and an Arcadian happiness (I won't say anything about
 innocence) in the bush, and it was as good to him as the honour and the
 Arcadian happiness of the streets to another man. Felicity, felicity?how
 shall I say it??is quaffed out of a golden cup in every latitude:
 the flavour is with you?with you alone, and you can make it as
 intoxicating as you please. He was of the sort that would drink deep, as
 you may guess from what went before. I found him, if not exactly
 intoxicated, then at least flushed with the elixir at his lips. He had not
 obtained it at once. There had been, as you know, a period of probation
 amongst infernal ship-chandlers, during which he had suffered and I had
 worried about?about?my trust?you may call it. I don't
 know that I am completely reassured now, after beholding him in all his
 brilliance. That was my last view of him?in a strong light,
 dominating, and yet in complete accord with his surroundings?with
 the life of the forests and with the life of men. I own that I was
 impressed, but I must admit to myself that after all this is not the
 lasting impression. He was protected by his isolation, alone of his own
 superior kind, in close touch with Nature, that keeps faith on such easy
 terms with her lovers. But I cannot fix before my eye the image of his
 safety. I shall always remember him as seen through the open door of my
 room, taking, perhaps, too much to heart the mere consequences of his
 failure. I am pleased, of course, that some good?and even some
 splendour?came out of my endeavours; but at times it seems to me it
 would have been better for my peace of mind if I had not stood between him
 and Chester's confoundedly generous offer. I wonder what his exuberant
 imagination would have made of Walpole islet?that most hopelessly
 forsaken crumb of dry land on the face of the waters. It is not likely I
 would ever have heard, for I must tell you that Chester, after calling at
 some Australian port to patch up his brig-rigged sea-anachronism, steamed
 out into the Pacific with a crew of twenty-two hands all told, and the
 only news having a possible bearing upon the mystery of his fate was the
 news of a hurricane which is supposed to have swept in its course over the
 Walpole shoals, a month or so afterwards. Not a vestige of the Argonauts
 ever turned up; not a sound came out of the waste. Finis! The Pacific is
 the most discreet of live, hot-tempered oceans: the chilly Antarctic can
 keep a secret too, but more in the manner of a grave.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And there is a sense of blessed finality in such discretion, which is
 what we all more or less sincerely are ready to admit?for what else
 is it that makes the idea of death supportable? End! Finis! the potent
 word that exorcises from the house of life the haunting shadow of fate.
 This is what?notwithstanding the testimony of my eyes and his own
 earnest assurances?I miss when I look back upon Jim's success. While
 there's life there is hope, truly; but there is fear too. I don't mean to
 say that I regret my action, nor will I pretend that I can't sleep o'
 nights in consequence; still, the idea obtrudes itself that he made so
 much of his disgrace while it is the guilt alone that matters. He was not?if
 I may say so?clear to me. He was not clear. And there is a suspicion
 he was not clear to himself either. There were his fine sensibilities, his
 fine feelings, his fine longings?a sort of sublimated, idealised
 selfishness. He was?if you allow me to say so?very fine; very
 fine?and very unfortunate. A little coarser nature would not have
 borne the strain; it would have had to come to terms with itself?with
 a sigh, with a grunt, or even with a guffaw; a still coarser one would
 have remained invulnerably ignorant and completely uninteresting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But he was too interesting or too unfortunate to be thrown to the dogs,
 or even to Chester. I felt this while I sat with my face over the paper
 and he fought and gasped, struggling for his breath in that terribly
 stealthy way, in my room; I felt it when he rushed out on the verandah as
 if to fling himself over?and didn't; I felt it more and more all the
 time he remained outside, faintly lighted on the background of night, as
 if standing on the shore of a sombre and hopeless sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'An abrupt heavy rumble made me lift my head. The noise seemed to roll
 away, and suddenly a searching and violent glare fell on the blind face of
 the night. The sustained and dazzling flickers seemed to last for an
 unconscionable time. The growl of the thunder increased steadily while I
 looked at him, distinct and black, planted solidly upon the shores of a
 sea of light. At the moment of greatest brilliance the darkness leaped
 back with a culminating crash, and he vanished before my dazzled eyes as
 utterly as though he had been blown to atoms. A blustering sigh passed;
 furious hands seemed to tear at the shrubs, shake the tops of the trees
 below, slam doors, break window-panes, all along the front of the
 building. He stepped in, closing the door behind him, and found me bending
 over the table: my sudden anxiety as to what he would say was very great,
 and akin to a fright. "May I have a cigarette?" he asked. I gave a push to
 the box without raising my head. "I want?want?tobacco," he
 muttered. I became extremely buoyant. "Just a moment." I grunted
 pleasantly. He took a few steps here and there. "That's over," I heard him
 say. A single distant clap of thunder came from the sea like a gun of
 distress. "The monsoon breaks up early this year," he remarked
 conversationally, somewhere behind me. This encouraged me to turn round,
 which I did as soon as I had finished addressing the last envelope. He was
 smoking greedily in the middle of the room, and though he heard the stir I
 made, he remained with his back to me for a time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Come?I carried it off pretty well," he said, wheeling suddenly.
 "Something's paid off?not much. I wonder what's to come." His face
 did not show any emotion, only it appeared a little darkened and swollen,
 as though he had been holding his breath. He smiled reluctantly as it
 were, and went on while I gazed up at him mutely. . . . "Thank you, though?your
 room?jolly convenient?for a chap?badly hipped." . . .
 The rain pattered and swished in the garden; a water-pipe (it must have
 had a hole in it) performed just outside the window a parody of blubbering
 woe with funny sobs and gurgling lamentations, interrupted by jerky spasms
 of silence. . . . "A bit of shelter," he mumbled and ceased.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'A flash of faded lightning darted in through the black framework of the
 windows and ebbed out without any noise. I was thinking how I had best
 approach him (I did not want to be flung off again) when he gave a little
 laugh. "No better than a vagabond now" . . . the end of the cigarette
 smouldered between his fingers . . . "without a single?single," he
 pronounced slowly; "and yet . . ." He paused; the rain fell with redoubled
 violence. "Some day one's bound to come upon some sort of chance to get it
 all back again. Must!" he whispered distinctly, glaring at my boots.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I did not even know what it was he wished so much to regain, what it was
 he had so terribly missed. It might have been so much that it was
 impossible to say. A piece of ass's skin, according to Chester. . . . He
 looked up at me inquisitively. "Perhaps. If life's long enough," I
 muttered through my teeth with unreasonable animosity. "Don't reckon too
 much on it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Jove! I feel as if nothing could ever touch me," he said in a tone of
 sombre conviction. "If this business couldn't knock me over, then there's
 no fear of there being not enough time to?climb out, and . . ." He
 looked upwards.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It struck me that it is from such as he that the great army of waifs and
 strays is recruited, the army that marches down, down into all the gutters
 of the earth. As soon as he left my room, that "bit of shelter," he would
 take his place in the ranks, and begin the journey towards the bottomless
 pit. I at least had no illusions; but it was I, too, who a moment ago had
 been so sure of the power of words, and now was afraid to speak, in the
 same way one dares not move for fear of losing a slippery hold. It is when
 we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how
 incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us
 the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun. It is as if loneliness
 were a hard and absolute condition of existence; the envelope of flesh and
 blood on which our eyes are fixed melts before the outstretched hand, and
 there remains only the capricious, unconsolable, and elusive spirit that
 no eye can follow, no hand can grasp. It was the fear of losing him that
 kept me silent, for it was borne upon me suddenly and with unaccountable
 force that should I let him slip away into the darkness I would never
 forgive myself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Well. Thanks?once more. You've been?er?uncommonly?really
 there's no word to . . . Uncommonly! I don't know why, I am sure. I am
 afraid I don't feel as grateful as I would if the whole thing hadn't been
 so brutally sprung on me. Because at bottom . . . you, yourself . . ." He
 stuttered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Possibly," I struck in. He frowned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"All the same, one is responsible." He watched me like a hawk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And that's true, too," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Well. I've gone with it to the end, and I don't intend to let any man
 cast it in my teeth without?without?resenting it." He clenched
 his fist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"There's yourself," I said with a smile?mirthless enough, God knows?but
 he looked at me menacingly. "That's my business," he said. An air of
 indomitable resolution came and went upon his face like a vain and passing
 shadow. Next moment he looked a dear good boy in trouble, as before. He
 flung away the cigarette. "Good-bye," he said, with the sudden haste of a
 man who had lingered too long in view of a pressing bit of work waiting
 for him; and then for a second or so he made not the slightest movement.
 The downpour fell with the heavy uninterrupted rush of a sweeping flood,
 with a sound of unchecked overwhelming fury that called to one's mind the
 images of collapsing bridges, of uprooted trees, of undermined mountains.
 No man could breast the colossal and headlong stream that seemed to break
 and swirl against the dim stillness in which we were precariously
 sheltered as if on an island. The perforated pipe gurgled, choked, spat,
 and splashed in odious ridicule of a swimmer fighting for his life. "It is
 raining," I remonstrated, "and I . . ." "Rain or shine," he began
 brusquely, checked himself, and walked to the window. "Perfect deluge," he
 muttered after a while: he leaned his forehead on the glass. "It's dark,
 too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Yes, it is very dark," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He pivoted on his heels, crossed the room, and had actually opened the
 door leading into the corridor before I leaped up from my chair. "Wait," I
 cried, "I want you to . . ." "I can't dine with you again to-night," he
 flung at me, with one leg out of the room already. "I haven't the
 slightest intention to ask you," I shouted. At this he drew back his foot,
 but remained mistrustfully in the very doorway. I lost no time in
 entreating him earnestly not to be absurd; to come in and shut the door.'

 CHAPTER 17

 <p>
 'He came in at last; but I believe it was mostly the rain that did it; it
 was falling just then with a devastating violence which quieted down
 gradually while we talked. His manner was very sober and set; his bearing
 was that of a naturally taciturn man possessed by an idea. My talk was of
 the material aspect of his position; it had the sole aim of saving him
 from the degradation, ruin, and despair that out there close so swiftly
 upon a friendless, homeless man; I pleaded with him to accept my help; I
 argued reasonably: and every time I looked up at that absorbed smooth
 face, so grave and youthful, I had a disturbing sense of being no help but
 rather an obstacle to some mysterious, inexplicable, impalpable striving
 of his wounded spirit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I suppose you intend to eat and drink and to sleep under shelter in the
 usual way," I remember saying with irritation. "You say you won't touch
 the money that is due to you." . . . He came as near as his sort can to
 making a gesture of horror. (There were three weeks and five days' pay
 owing him as mate of the Patna.) "Well, that's too little to matter
 anyhow; but what will you do to-morrow? Where will you turn? You must live
 . . ." "That isn't the thing," was the comment that escaped him under his
 breath. I ignored it, and went on combating what I assumed to be the
 scruples of an exaggerated delicacy. "On every conceivable ground," I
 concluded, "you must let me help you." "You can't," he said very simply
 and gently, and holding fast to some deep idea which I could detect
 shimmering like a pool of water in the dark, but which I despaired of ever
 approaching near enough to fathom. I surveyed his well-proportioned bulk.
 "At any rate," I said, "I am able to help what I can see of you. I don't
 pretend to do more." He shook his head sceptically without looking at me.
 I got very warm. "But I can," I insisted. "I can do even more. I <i>am</i>
 doing more. I am trusting you . . ." "The money . . ." he began. "Upon my
 word you deserve being told to go to the devil," I cried, forcing the note
 of indignation. He was startled, smiled, and I pressed my attack home. "It
 isn't a question of money at all. You are too superficial," I said (and at
 the same time I was thinking to myself: Well, here goes! And perhaps he
 is, after all). "Look at the letter I want you to take. I am writing to a
 man of whom I've never asked a favour, and I am writing about you in terms
 that one only ventures to use when speaking of an intimate friend. I make
 myself unreservedly responsible for you. That's what I am doing. And
 really if you will only reflect a little what that means . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He lifted his head. The rain had passed away; only the water-pipe went on
 shedding tears with an absurd drip, drip outside the window. It was very
 quiet in the room, whose shadows huddled together in corners, away from
 the still flame of the candle flaring upright in the shape of a dagger;
 his face after a while seemed suffused by a reflection of a soft light as
 if the dawn had broken already.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Jove!" he gasped out. "It is noble of you!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Had he suddenly put out his tongue at me in derision, I could not have
 felt more humiliated. I thought to myself?Serve me right for a
 sneaking humbug. . . . His eyes shone straight into my face, but I
 perceived it was not a mocking brightness. All at once he sprang into
 jerky agitation, like one of those flat wooden figures that are worked by
 a string. His arms went up, then came down with a slap. He became another
 man altogether. "And I had never seen," he shouted; then suddenly bit his
 lip and frowned. "What a bally ass I've been," he said very slow in an
 awed tone. . . . "You are a brick!" he cried next in a muffled voice. He
 snatched my hand as though he had just then seen it for the first time,
 and dropped it at once. "Why! this is what I?you?I . . ." he
 stammered, and then with a return of his old stolid, I may say mulish,
 manner he began heavily, "I would be a brute now if I . . ." and then his
 voice seemed to break. "That's all right," I said. I was almost alarmed by
 this display of feeling, through which pierced a strange elation. I had
 pulled the string accidentally, as it were; I did not fully understand the
 working of the toy. "I must go now," he said. "Jove! You <i>have</i>
 helped me. Can't sit still. The very thing . . ." He looked at me with
 puzzled admiration. "The very thing . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Of course it was the thing. It was ten to one that I had saved him from
 starvation?of that peculiar sort that is almost invariably
 associated with drink. This was all. I had not a single illusion on that
 score, but looking at him, I allowed myself to wonder at the nature of the
 one he had, within the last three minutes, so evidently taken into his
 bosom. I had forced into his hand the means to carry on decently the
 serious business of life, to get food, drink, and shelter of the customary
 kind while his wounded spirit, like a bird with a broken wing, might hop
 and flutter into some hole to die quietly of inanition there. This is what
 I had thrust upon him: a definitely small thing; and?behold!?by
 the manner of its reception it loomed in the dim light of the candle like
 a big, indistinct, perhaps a dangerous shadow. "You don't mind me not
 saying anything appropriate," he burst out. "There isn't anything one
 could say. Last night already you had done me no end of good. Listening to
 me?you know. I give you my word I've thought more than once the top
 of my head would fly off. . ." He darted?positively darted?here
 and there, rammed his hands into his pockets, jerked them out again, flung
 his cap on his head. I had no idea it was in him to be so airily brisk. I
 thought of a dry leaf imprisoned in an eddy of wind, while a mysterious
 apprehension, a load of indefinite doubt, weighed me down in my chair. He
 stood stock-still, as if struck motionless by a discovery. "You have given
 me confidence," he declared, soberly. "Oh! for God's sake, my dear fellow?don't!"
 I entreated, as though he had hurt me. "All right. I'll shut up now and
 henceforth. Can't prevent me thinking though. . . . Never mind! . . . I'll
 show yet . . ." He went to the door in a hurry, paused with his head down,
 and came back, stepping deliberately. "I always thought that if a fellow
 could begin with a clean slate . . . And now you . . . in a measure . . .
 yes . . . clean slate." I waved my hand, and he marched out without
 looking back; the sound of his footfalls died out gradually behind the
 closed door?the unhesitating tread of a man walking in broad
 daylight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But as to me, left alone with the solitary candle, I remained strangely
 unenlightened. I was no longer young enough to behold at every turn the
 magnificence that besets our insignificant footsteps in good and in evil.
 I smiled to think that, after all, it was yet he, of us two, who had the
 light. And I felt sad. A clean slate, did he say? As if the initial word
 of each our destiny were not graven in imperishable characters upon the
 face of a rock.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 18
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Six months afterwards my friend (he was a cynical, more than middle-aged
 bachelor, with a reputation for eccentricity, and owned a rice-mill) wrote
 to me, and judging, from the warmth of my recommendation, that I would
 like to hear, enlarged a little upon Jim's perfections. These were
 apparently of a quiet and effective sort. "Not having been able so far to
 find more in my heart than a resigned toleration for any individual of my
 kind, I have lived till now alone in a house that even in this steaming
 climate could be considered as too big for one man. I have had him to live
 with me for some time past. It seems I haven't made a mistake." It seemed
 to me on reading this letter that my friend had found in his heart more
 than tolerance for Jim?that there were the beginnings of active
 liking. Of course he stated his grounds in a characteristic way. For one
 thing, Jim kept his freshness in the climate. Had he been a girl?my
 friend wrote?one could have said he was blooming?blooming
 modestly?like a violet, not like some of these blatant tropical
 flowers. He had been in the house for six weeks, and had not as yet
 attempted to slap him on the back, or address him as "old boy," or try to
 make him feel a superannuated fossil. He had nothing of the exasperating
 young man's chatter. He was good-tempered, had not much to say for
 himself, was not clever by any means, thank goodness?wrote my
 friend. It appeared, however, that Jim was clever enough to be quietly
 appreciative of his wit, while, on the other hand, he amused him by his
 naiveness. "The dew is yet on him, and since I had the bright idea of
 giving him a room in the house and having him at meals I feel less
 withered myself. The other day he took it into his head to cross the room
 with no other purpose but to open a door for me; and I felt more in touch
 with mankind than I had been for years. Ridiculous, isn't it? Of course I
 guess there is something?some awful little scrape?which you
 know all about?but if I am sure that it is terribly heinous, I fancy
 one could manage to forgive it. For my part, I declare I am unable to
 imagine him guilty of anything much worse than robbing an orchard. Is it
 much worse? Perhaps you ought to have told me; but it is such a long time
 since we both turned saints that you may have forgotten we, too, had
 sinned in our time? It may be that some day I shall have to ask you, and
 then I shall expect to be told. I don't care to question him myself till I
 have some idea what it is. Moreover, it's too soon as yet. Let him open
 the door a few times more for me. . . ." Thus my friend. I was trebly
 pleased?at Jim's shaping so well, at the tone of the letter, at my
 own cleverness. Evidently I had known what I was doing. I had read
 characters aright, and so on. And what if something unexpected and
 wonderful were to come of it? That evening, reposing in a deck-chair under
 the shade of my own poop awning (it was in Hong-Kong harbour), I laid on
 Jim's behalf the first stone of a castle in Spain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I made a trip to the northward, and when I returned I found another
 letter from my friend waiting for me. It was the first envelope I tore
 open. "There are no spoons missing, as far as I know," ran the first line;
 "I haven't been interested enough to inquire. He is gone, leaving on the
 breakfast-table a formal little note of apology, which is either silly or
 heartless. Probably both?and it's all one to me. Allow me to say,
 lest you should have some more mysterious young men in reserve, that I
 have shut up shop, definitely and for ever. This is the last eccentricity
 I shall be guilty of. Do not imagine for a moment that I care a hang; but
 he is very much regretted at tennis-parties, and for my own sake I've told
 a plausible lie at the club. . . ." I flung the letter aside and started
 looking through the batch on my table, till I came upon Jim's handwriting.
 Would you believe it? One chance in a hundred! But it is always that
 hundredth chance! That little second engineer of the Patna had turned up
 in a more or less destitute state, and got a temporary job of looking
 after the machinery of the mill. "I couldn't stand the familiarity of the
 little beast," Jim wrote from a seaport seven hundred miles south of the
 place where he should have been in clover. "I am now for the time with
 Egstrom &amp; Blake, ship-chandlers, as their?well?runner, to
 call the thing by its right name. For reference I gave them your name,
 which they know of course, and if you could write a word in my favour it
 would be a permanent employment." I was utterly crushed under the ruins of
 my castle, but of course I wrote as desired. Before the end of the year my
 new charter took me that way, and I had an opportunity of seeing him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He was still with Egstrom &amp; Blake, and we met in what they called
 "our parlour" opening out of the store. He had that moment come in from
 boarding a ship, and confronted me head down, ready for a tussle. "What
 have you got to say for yourself?" I began as soon as we had shaken hands.
 "What I wrote you?nothing more," he said stubbornly. "Did the fellow
 blab?or what?" I asked. He looked up at me with a troubled smile.
 "Oh, no! He didn't. He made it a kind of confidential business between us.
 He was most damnably mysterious whenever I came over to the mill; he would
 wink at me in a respectful manner?as much as to say 'We know what we
 know.' Infernally fawning and familiar?and that sort of thing . . ."
 He threw himself into a chair and stared down his legs. "One day we
 happened to be alone and the fellow had the cheek to say, 'Well, Mr.
 James'?I was called Mr. James there as if I had been the son?'here
 we are together once more. This is better than the old ship?ain't
 it?' . . . Wasn't it appalling, eh? I looked at him, and he put on a
 knowing air. 'Don't you be uneasy, sir,' he says. 'I know a gentleman when
 I see one, and I know how a gentleman feels. I hope, though, you will be
 keeping me on this job. I had a hard time of it too, along of that rotten
 old Patna racket.' Jove! It was awful. I don't know what I should have
 said or done if I had not just then heard Mr. Denver calling me in the
 passage. It was tiffin-time, and we walked together across the yard and
 through the garden to the bungalow. He began to chaff me in his kindly way
 . . . I believe he liked me . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim was silent for a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I know he liked me. That's what made it so hard. Such a splendid man! .
 . . That morning he slipped his hand under my arm. . . . He, too, was
 familiar with me." He burst into a short laugh, and dropped his chin on
 his breast. "Pah! When I remembered how that mean little beast had been
 talking to me," he began suddenly in a vibrating voice, "I couldn't bear
 to think of myself . . . I suppose you know . . ." I nodded. . . . "More
 like a father," he cried; his voice sank. "I would have had to tell him. I
 couldn't let it go on?could I?" "Well?" I murmured, after waiting a
 while. "I preferred to go," he said slowly; "this thing must be buried."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'We could hear in the shop Blake upbraiding Egstrom in an abusive,
 strained voice. They had been associated for many years, and every day
 from the moment the doors were opened to the last minute before closing,
 Blake, a little man with sleek, jetty hair and unhappy, beady eyes, could
 be heard rowing his partner incessantly with a sort of scathing and
 plaintive fury. The sound of that everlasting scolding was part of the
 place like the other fixtures; even strangers would very soon come to
 disregard it completely unless it be perhaps to mutter "Nuisance," or to
 get up suddenly and shut the door of the "parlour." Egstrom himself, a
 raw-boned, heavy Scandinavian, with a busy manner and immense blonde
 whiskers, went on directing his people, checking parcels, making out bills
 or writing letters at a stand-up desk in the shop, and comported himself
 in that clatter exactly as though he had been stone-deaf. Now and again he
 would emit a bothered perfunctory "Sssh," which neither produced nor was
 expected to produce the slightest effect. "They are very decent to me
 here," said Jim. "Blake's a little cad, but Egstrom's all right." He stood
 up quickly, and walking with measured steps to a tripod telescope standing
 in the window and pointed at the roadstead, he applied his eye to it.
 "There's that ship which has been becalmed outside all the morning has got
 a breeze now and is coming in," he remarked patiently; "I must go and
 board." We shook hands in silence, and he turned to go. "Jim!" I cried. He
 looked round with his hand on the lock. "You?you have thrown away
 something like a fortune." He came back to me all the way from the door.
 "Such a splendid old chap," he said. "How could I? How could I?" His lips
 twitched. "Here it does not matter." "Oh! you?you?" I began,
 and had to cast about for a suitable word, but before I became aware that
 there was no name that would just do, he was gone. I heard outside
 Egstrom's deep gentle voice saying cheerily, "That's the Sarah W. Granger,
 Jimmy. You must manage to be first aboard"; and directly Blake struck in,
 screaming after the manner of an outraged cockatoo, "Tell the captain
 we've got some of his mail here. That'll fetch him. D'ye hear, Mister
 What's-your-name?" And there was Jim answering Egstrom with something
 boyish in his tone. "All right. I'll make a race of it." He seemed to take
 refuge in the boat-sailing part of that sorry business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I did not see him again that trip, but on my next (I had a six months'
 charter) I went up to the store. Ten yards away from the door Blake's
 scolding met my ears, and when I came in he gave me a glance of utter
 wretchedness; Egstrom, all smiles, advanced, extending a large bony hand.
 "Glad to see you, captain. . . . Sssh. . . . Been thinking you were about
 due back here. What did you say, sir? . . . Sssh. . . . Oh! him! He has
 left us. Come into the parlour." . . . After the slam of the door Blake's
 strained voice became faint, as the voice of one scolding desperately in a
 wilderness. . . . "Put us to a great inconvenience, too. Used us badly?I
 must say . . ." "Where's he gone to? Do you know?" I asked. "No. It's no
 use asking either," said Egstrom, standing bewhiskered and obliging before
 me with his arms hanging down his sides clumsily, and a thin silver
 watch-chain looped very low on a rucked-up blue serge waistcoat. "A man
 like that don't go anywhere in particular." I was too concerned at the
 news to ask for the explanation of that pronouncement, and he went on. "He
 left?let's see?the very day a steamer with returning pilgrims
 from the Red Sea put in here with two blades of her propeller gone. Three
 weeks ago now." "Wasn't there something said about the Patna case?" I
 asked, fearing the worst. He gave a start, and looked at me as if I had
 been a sorcerer. "Why, yes! How do you know? Some of them were talking
 about it here. There was a captain or two, the manager of Vanlo's
 engineering shop at the harbour, two or three others, and myself. Jim was
 in here too, having a sandwich and a glass of beer; when we are busy?you
 see, captain?there's no time for a proper tiffin. He was standing by
 this table eating sandwiches, and the rest of us were round the telescope
 watching that steamer come in; and by-and-by Vanlo's manager began to talk
 about the chief of the Patna; he had done some repairs for him once, and
 from that he went on to tell us what an old ruin she was, and the money
 that had been made out of her. He came to mention her last voyage, and
 then we all struck in. Some said one thing and some another?not much?what
 you or any other man might say; and there was some laughing. Captain
 O'Brien of the Sarah W. Granger, a large, noisy old man with a stick?he
 was sitting listening to us in this arm-chair here?he let drive
 suddenly with his stick at the floor, and roars out, 'Skunks!' . . . Made
 us all jump. Vanlo's manager winks at us and asks, 'What's the matter,
 Captain O'Brien?' 'Matter! matter!' the old man began to shout; 'what are
 you Injuns laughing at? It's no laughing matter. It's a disgrace to human
 natur'?that's what it is. I would despise being seen in the same
 room with one of those men. Yes, sir!' He seemed to catch my eye like, and
 I had to speak out of civility. 'Skunks!' says I, 'of course, Captain
 O'Brien, and I wouldn't care to have them here myself, so you're quite
 safe in this room, Captain O'Brien. Have a little something cool to
 drink.' 'Dam' your drink, Egstrom,' says he, with a twinkle in his eye;
 'when I want a drink I will shout for it. I am going to quit. It stinks
 here now.' At this all the others burst out laughing, and out they go
 after the old man. And then, sir, that blasted Jim he puts down the
 sandwich he had in his hand and walks round the table to me; there was his
 glass of beer poured out quite full. 'I am off,' he says?just like
 this. 'It isn't half-past one yet,' says I; 'you might snatch a smoke
 first.' I thought he meant it was time for him to go down to his work.
 When I understood what he was up to, my arms fell?so! Can't get a
 man like that every day, you know, sir; a regular devil for sailing a
 boat; ready to go out miles to sea to meet ships in any sort of weather.
 More than once a captain would come in here full of it, and the first
 thing he would say would be, 'That's a reckless sort of a lunatic you've
 got for water-clerk, Egstrom. I was feeling my way in at daylight under
 short canvas when there comes flying out of the mist right under my
 forefoot a boat half under water, sprays going over the mast-head, two
 frightened niggers on the bottom boards, a yelling fiend at the tiller.
 Hey! hey! Ship ahoy! ahoy! Captain! Hey! hey! Egstrom &amp; Blake's man
 first to speak to you! Hey! hey! Egstrom &amp; Blake! Hallo! hey! whoop!
 Kick the niggers?out reefs?a squall on at the time?shoots
 ahead whooping and yelling to me to make sail and he would give me a lead
 in?more like a demon than a man. Never saw a boat handled like that
 in all my life. Couldn't have been drunk?was he? Such a quiet,
 soft-spoken chap too?blush like a girl when he came on board. . . .'
 I tell you, Captain Marlow, nobody had a chance against us with a strange
 ship when Jim was out. The other ship-chandlers just kept their old
 customers, and . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Egstrom appeared overcome with emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Why, sir?it seemed as though he wouldn't mind going a hundred
 miles out to sea in an old shoe to nab a ship for the firm. If the
 business had been his own and all to make yet, he couldn't have done more
 in that way. And now . . . all at once . . . like this! Thinks I to
 myself: 'Oho! a rise in the screw?that's the trouble?is it?'
 'All right,' says I, 'no need of all that fuss with me, Jimmy. Just
 mention your figure. Anything in reason.' He looks at me as if he wanted
 to swallow something that stuck in his throat. 'I can't stop with you.'
 'What's that blooming joke?' I asks. He shakes his head, and I could see
 in his eye he was as good as gone already, sir. So I turned to him and
 slanged him till all was blue. 'What is it you're running away from?' I
 asks. 'Who has been getting at you? What scared you? You haven't as much
 sense as a rat; they don't clear out from a good ship. Where do you expect
 to get a better berth??you this and you that.' I made him look sick,
 I can tell you. 'This business ain't going to sink,' says I. He gave a big
 jump. 'Good-bye,' he says, nodding at me like a lord; 'you ain't half a
 bad chap, Egstrom. I give you my word that if you knew my reasons you
 wouldn't care to keep me.' 'That's the biggest lie you ever told in your
 life,' says I; 'I know my own mind.' He made me so mad that I had to
 laugh. 'Can't you really stop long enough to drink this glass of beer
 here, you funny beggar, you?' I don't know what came over him; he didn't
 seem able to find the door; something comical, I can tell you, captain. I
 drank the beer myself. 'Well, if you're in such a hurry, here's luck to
 you in your own drink,' says I; 'only, you mark my words, if you keep up
 this game you'll very soon find that the earth ain't big enough to hold
 you?that's all.' He gave me one black look, and out he rushed with a
 face fit to scare little children."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Egstrom snorted bitterly, and combed one auburn whisker with knotty
 fingers. "Haven't been able to get a man that was any good since. It's
 nothing but worry, worry, worry in business. And where might you have come
 across him, captain, if it's fair to ask?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He was the mate of the Patna that voyage," I said, feeling that I owed
 some explanation. For a time Egstrom remained very still, with his fingers
 plunged in the hair at the side of his face, and then exploded. "And who
 the devil cares about that?" "I daresay no one," I began . . . "And what
 the devil is he?anyhow?for to go on like this?" He stuffed
 suddenly his left whisker into his mouth and stood amazed. "Jee!" he
 exclaimed, "I told him the earth wouldn't be big enough to hold his
 caper."'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 19
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I have told you these two episodes at length to show his manner of
 dealing with himself under the new conditions of his life. There were many
 others of the sort, more than I could count on the fingers of my two
 hands. They were all equally tinged by a high-minded absurdity of
 intention which made their futility profound and touching. To fling away
 your daily bread so as to get your hands free for a grapple with a ghost
 may be an act of prosaic heroism. Men had done it before (though we who
 have lived know full well that it is not the haunted soul but the hungry
 body that makes an outcast), and men who had eaten and meant to eat every
 day had applauded the creditable folly. He was indeed unfortunate, for all
 his recklessness could not carry him out from under the shadow. There was
 always a doubt of his courage. The truth seems to be that it is impossible
 to lay the ghost of a fact. You can face it or shirk it?and I have
 come across a man or two who could wink at their familiar shades.
 Obviously Jim was not of the winking sort; but what I could never make up
 my mind about was whether his line of conduct amounted to shirking his
 ghost or to facing him out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I strained my mental eyesight only to discover that, as with the
 complexion of all our actions, the shade of difference was so delicate
 that it was impossible to say. It might have been flight and it might have
 been a mode of combat. To the common mind he became known as a rolling
 stone, because this was the funniest part: he did after a time become
 perfectly known, and even notorious, within the circle of his wanderings
 (which had a diameter of, say, three thousand miles), in the same way as
 an eccentric character is known to a whole countryside. For instance, in
 Bankok, where he found employment with Yucker Brothers, charterers and
 teak merchants, it was almost pathetic to see him go about in sunshine
 hugging his secret, which was known to the very up-country logs on the
 river. Schomberg, the keeper of the hotel where he boarded, a hirsute
 Alsatian of manly bearing and an irrepressible retailer of all the
 scandalous gossip of the place, would, with both elbows on the table,
 impart an adorned version of the story to any guest who cared to imbibe
 knowledge along with the more costly liquors. "And, mind you, the nicest
 fellow you could meet," would be his generous conclusion; "quite
 superior." It says a lot for the casual crowd that frequented Schomberg's
 establishment that Jim managed to hang out in Bankok for a whole six
 months. I remarked that people, perfect strangers, took to him as one
 takes to a nice child. His manner was reserved, but it was as though his
 personal appearance, his hair, his eyes, his smile, made friends for him
 wherever he went. And, of course, he was no fool. I heard Siegmund Yucker
 (native of Switzerland), a gentle creature ravaged by a cruel dyspepsia,
 and so frightfully lame that his head swung through a quarter of a circle
 at every step he took, declare appreciatively that for one so young he was
 "of great gabasidy," as though it had been a mere question of cubic
 contents. "Why not send him up country?" I suggested anxiously. (Yucker
 Brothers had concessions and teak forests in the interior.) "If he has
 capacity, as you say, he will soon get hold of the work. And physically he
 is very fit. His health is always excellent." "Ach! It's a great ting in
 dis goundry to be vree vrom tispep-shia," sighed poor Yucker enviously,
 casting a stealthy glance at the pit of his ruined stomach. I left him
 drumming pensively on his desk and muttering, "Es ist ein' Idee. Es ist
 ein' Idee." Unfortunately, that very evening an unpleasant affair took
 place in the hotel.

 'I don't know that I blame Jim very much, but it was a truly regrettable
 incident. It belonged to the lamentable species of bar-room scuffles, and
 the other party to it was a cross-eyed Dane of sorts whose visiting-card
 recited, under his misbegotten name: first lieutenant in the Royal Siamese
 Navy. The fellow, of course, was utterly hopeless at billiards, but did
 not like to be beaten, I suppose. He had had enough to drink to turn nasty
 after the sixth game, and make some scornful remark at Jim's expense. Most
 of the people there didn't hear what was said, and those who had heard
 seemed to have had all precise recollection scared out of them by the
 appalling nature of the consequences that immediately ensued. It was very
 lucky for the Dane that he could swim, because the room opened on a
 verandah and the Menam flowed below very wide and black. A boat-load of
 Chinamen, bound, as likely as not, on some thieving expedition, fished out
 the officer of the King of Siam, and Jim turned up at about midnight on
 board my ship without a hat. "Everybody in the room seemed to know," he
 said, gasping yet from the contest, as it were. He was rather sorry, on
 general principles, for what had happened, though in this case there had
 been, he said, "no option." But what dismayed him was to find the nature
 of his burden as well known to everybody as though he had gone about all
 that time carrying it on his shoulders. Naturally after this he couldn't
 remain in the place. He was universally condemned for the brutal violence,
 so unbecoming a man in his delicate position; some maintained he had been
 disgracefully drunk at the time; others criticised his want of tact. Even
 Schomberg was very much annoyed. "He is a very nice young man," he said
 argumentatively to me, "but the lieutenant is a first-rate fellow too. He
 dines every night at my table d'hote, you know. And there's a billiard-cue
 broken. I can't allow that. First thing this morning I went over with my
 apologies to the lieutenant, and I think I've made it all right for
 myself; but only think, captain, if everybody started such games! Why, the
 man might have been drowned! And here I can't run out into the next street
 and buy a new cue. I've got to write to Europe for them. No, no! A temper
 like that won't do!" . . . He was extremely sore on the subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This was the worst incident of all in his?his retreat. Nobody could
 deplore it more than myself; for if, as somebody said hearing him
 mentioned, "Oh yes! I know. He has knocked about a good deal out here,"
 yet he had somehow avoided being battered and chipped in the process. This
 last affair, however, made me seriously uneasy, because if his exquisite
 sensibilities were to go the length of involving him in pot-house
 shindies, he would lose his name of an inoffensive, if aggravating, fool,
 and acquire that of a common loafer. For all my confidence in him I could
 not help reflecting that in such cases from the name to the thing itself
 is but a step. I suppose you will understand that by that time I could not
 think of washing my hands of him. I took him away from Bankok in my ship,
 and we had a longish passage. It was pitiful to see how he shrank within
 himself. A seaman, even if a mere passenger, takes an interest in a ship,
 and looks at the sea-life around him with the critical enjoyment of a
 painter, for instance, looking at another man's work. In every sense of
 the expression he is "on deck"; but my Jim, for the most part, skulked
 down below as though he had been a stowaway. He infected me so that I
 avoided speaking on professional matters, such as would suggest themselves
 naturally to two sailors during a passage. For whole days we did not
 exchange a word; I felt extremely unwilling to give orders to my officers
 in his presence. Often, when alone with him on deck or in the cabin, we
 didn't know what to do with our eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I placed him with De Jongh, as you know, glad enough to dispose of him in
 any way, yet persuaded that his position was now growing intolerable. He
 had lost some of that elasticity which had enabled him to rebound back
 into his uncompromising position after every overthrow. One day, coming
 ashore, I saw him standing on the quay; the water of the roadstead and the
 sea in the offing made one smooth ascending plane, and the outermost ships
 at anchor seemed to ride motionless in the sky. He was waiting for his
 boat, which was being loaded at our feet with packages of small stores for
 some vessel ready to leave. After exchanging greetings, we remained silent?side
 by side. "Jove!" he said suddenly, "this is killing work."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He smiled at me; I must say he generally could manage a smile. I made no
 reply. I knew very well he was not alluding to his duties; he had an easy
 time of it with De Jongh. Nevertheless, as soon as he had spoken I became
 completely convinced that the work was killing. I did not even look at
 him. "Would you like," said I, "to leave this part of the world
 altogether; try California or the West Coast? I'll see what I can do . .
 ." He interrupted me a little scornfully. "What difference would it make?"
 . . . I felt at once convinced that he was right. It would make no
 difference; it was not relief he wanted; I seemed to perceive dimly that
 what he wanted, what he was, as it were, waiting for, was something not
 easy to define?something in the nature of an opportunity. I had
 given him many opportunities, but they had been merely opportunities to
 earn his bread. Yet what more could any man do? The position struck me as
 hopeless, and poor Brierly's saying recurred to me, "Let him creep twenty
 feet underground and stay there." Better that, I thought, than this
 waiting above ground for the impossible. Yet one could not be sure even of
 that. There and then, before his boat was three oars' lengths away from
 the quay, I had made up my mind to go and consult Stein in the evening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This Stein was a wealthy and respected merchant. His "house" (because it
 was a house, Stein &amp; Co., and there was some sort of partner who, as
 Stein said, "looked after the Moluccas") had a large inter-island
 business, with a lot of trading posts established in the most
 out-of-the-way places for collecting the produce. His wealth and his
 respectability were not exactly the reasons why I was anxious to seek his
 advice. I desired to confide my difficulty to him because he was one of
 the most trustworthy men I had ever known. The gentle light of a simple,
 unwearied, as it were, and intelligent good-nature illumined his long
 hairless face. It had deep downward folds, and was pale as of a man who
 had always led a sedentary life?which was indeed very far from being
 the case. His hair was thin, and brushed back from a massive and lofty
 forehead. One fancied that at twenty he must have looked very much like
 what he was now at threescore. It was a student's face; only the eyebrows
 nearly all white, thick and bushy, together with the resolute searching
 glance that came from under them, were not in accord with his, I may say,
 learned appearance. He was tall and loose-jointed; his slight stoop,
 together with an innocent smile, made him appear benevolently ready to
 lend you his ear; his long arms with pale big hands had rare deliberate
 gestures of a pointing out, demonstrating kind. I speak of him at length,
 because under this exterior, and in conjunction with an upright and
 indulgent nature, this man possessed an intrepidity of spirit and a
 physical courage that could have been called reckless had it not been like
 a natural function of the body?say good digestion, for instance?completely
 unconscious of itself. It is sometimes said of a man that he carries his
 life in his hand. Such a saying would have been inadequate if applied to
 him; during the early part of his existence in the East he had been
 playing ball with it. All this was in the past, but I knew the story of
 his life and the origin of his fortune. He was also a naturalist of some
 distinction, or perhaps I should say a learned collector. Entomology was
 his special study. His collection of Buprestidae and Longicorns?beetles
 all?horrible miniature monsters, looking malevolent in death and
 immobility, and his cabinet of butterflies, beautiful and hovering under
 the glass of cases on lifeless wings, had spread his fame far over the
 earth. The name of this merchant, adventurer, sometime adviser of a Malay
 sultan (to whom he never alluded otherwise than as "my poor Mohammed
 Bonso"), had, on account of a few bushels of dead insects, become known to
 learned persons in Europe, who could have had no conception, and certainly
 would not have cared to know anything, of his life or character. I, who
 knew, considered him an eminently suitable person to receive my
 confidences about Jim's difficulties as well as my own.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 20
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Late in the evening I entered his study, after traversing an imposing but
 empty dining-room very dimly lit. The house was silent. I was preceded by
 an elderly grim Javanese servant in a sort of livery of white jacket and
 yellow sarong, who, after throwing the door open, exclaimed low, "O
 master!" and stepping aside, vanished in a mysterious way as though he had
 been a ghost only momentarily embodied for that particular service. Stein
 turned round with the chair, and in the same movement his spectacles
 seemed to get pushed up on his forehead. He welcomed me in his quiet and
 humorous voice. Only one corner of the vast room, the corner in which
 stood his writing-desk, was strongly lighted by a shaded reading-lamp, and
 the rest of the spacious apartment melted into shapeless gloom like a
 cavern. Narrow shelves filled with dark boxes of uniform shape and colour
 ran round the walls, not from floor to ceiling, but in a sombre belt about
 four feet broad. Catacombs of beetles. Wooden tablets were hung above at
 irregular intervals. The light reached one of them, and the word
 Coleoptera written in gold letters glittered mysteriously upon a vast
 dimness. The glass cases containing the collection of butterflies were
 ranged in three long rows upon slender-legged little tables. One of these
 cases had been removed from its place and stood on the desk, which was
 bestrewn with oblong slips of paper blackened with minute handwriting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"So you see me?so," he said. His hand hovered over the case where a
 butterfly in solitary grandeur spread out dark bronze wings, seven inches
 or more across, with exquisite white veinings and a gorgeous border of
 yellow spots. "Only one specimen like this they have in <i>your</i>
 London, and then?no more. To my small native town this my collection
 I shall bequeath. Something of me. The best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He bent forward in the chair and gazed intently, his chin over the front
 of the case. I stood at his back. "Marvellous," he whispered, and seemed
 to forget my presence. His history was curious. He had been born in
 Bavaria, and when a youth of twenty-two had taken an active part in the
 revolutionary movement of 1848. Heavily compromised, he managed to make
 his escape, and at first found a refuge with a poor republican watchmaker
 in Trieste. From there he made his way to Tripoli with a stock of cheap
 watches to hawk about,?not a very great opening truly, but it turned
 out lucky enough, because it was there he came upon a Dutch traveller?a
 rather famous man, I believe, but I don't remember his name. It was that
 naturalist who, engaging him as a sort of assistant, took him to the East.
 They travelled in the Archipelago together and separately, collecting
 insects and birds, for four years or more. Then the naturalist went home,
 and Stein, having no home to go to, remained with an old trader he had
 come across in his journeys in the interior of Celebes?if Celebes
 may be said to have an interior. This old Scotsman, the only white man
 allowed to reside in the country at the time, was a privileged friend of
 the chief ruler of Wajo States, who was a woman. I often heard Stein
 relate how that chap, who was slightly paralysed on one side, had
 introduced him to the native court a short time before another stroke
 carried him off. He was a heavy man with a patriarchal white beard, and of
 imposing stature. He came into the council-hall where all the rajahs,
 pangerans, and headmen were assembled, with the queen, a fat wrinkled
 woman (very free in her speech, Stein said), reclining on a high couch
 under a canopy. He dragged his leg, thumping with his stick, and grasped
 Stein's arm, leading him right up to the couch. "Look, queen, and you
 rajahs, this is my son," he proclaimed in a stentorian voice. "I have
 traded with your fathers, and when I die he shall trade with you and your
 sons."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'By means of this simple formality Stein inherited the Scotsman's
 privileged position and all his stock-in-trade, together with a fortified
 house on the banks of the only navigable river in the country. Shortly
 afterwards the old queen, who was so free in her speech, died, and the
 country became disturbed by various pretenders to the throne. Stein joined
 the party of a younger son, the one of whom thirty years later he never
 spoke otherwise but as "my poor Mohammed Bonso." They both became the
 heroes of innumerable exploits; they had wonderful adventures, and once
 stood a siege in the Scotsman's house for a month, with only a score of
 followers against a whole army. I believe the natives talk of that war to
 this day. Meantime, it seems, Stein never failed to annex on his own
 account every butterfly or beetle he could lay hands on. After some eight
 years of war, negotiations, false truces, sudden outbreaks,
 reconciliation, treachery, and so on, and just as peace seemed at last
 permanently established, his "poor Mohammed Bonso" was assassinated at the
 gate of his own royal residence while dismounting in the highest spirits
 on his return from a successful deer-hunt. This event rendered Stein's
 position extremely insecure, but he would have stayed perhaps had it not
 been that a short time afterwards he lost Mohammed's sister ("my dear wife
 the princess," he used to say solemnly), by whom he had had a daughter?mother
 and child both dying within three days of each other from some infectious
 fever. He left the country, which this cruel loss had made unbearable to
 him. Thus ended the first and adventurous part of his existence. What
 followed was so different that, but for the reality of sorrow which
 remained with him, this strange part must have resembled a dream. He had a
 little money; he started life afresh, and in the course of years acquired
 a considerable fortune. At first he had travelled a good deal amongst the
 islands, but age had stolen upon him, and of late he seldom left his
 spacious house three miles out of town, with an extensive garden, and
 surrounded by stables, offices, and bamboo cottages for his servants and
 dependants, of whom he had many. He drove in his buggy every morning to
 town, where he had an office with white and Chinese clerks. He owned a
 small fleet of schooners and native craft, and dealt in island produce on
 a large scale. For the rest he lived solitary, but not misanthropic, with
 his books and his collection, classing and arranging specimens,
 corresponding with entomologists in Europe, writing up a descriptive
 catalogue of his treasures. Such was the history of the man whom I had
 come to consult upon Jim's case without any definite hope. Simply to hear
 what he would have to say would have been a relief. I was very anxious,
 but I respected the intense, almost passionate, absorption with which he
 looked at a butterfly, as though on the bronze sheen of these frail wings,
 in the white tracings, in the gorgeous markings, he could see other
 things, an image of something as perishable and defying destruction as
 these delicate and lifeless tissues displaying a splendour unmarred by
 death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Marvellous!" he repeated, looking up at me. "Look! The beauty?but
 that is nothing?look at the accuracy, the harmony. And so fragile!
 And so strong! And so exact! This is Nature?the balance of colossal
 forces. Every star is so?and every blade of grass stands so?and
 the mighty Kosmos in perfect equilibrium produces?this. This wonder;
 this masterpiece of Nature?the great artist."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Never heard an entomologist go on like this," I observed cheerfully.
 "Masterpiece! And what of man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Man is amazing, but he is not a masterpiece," he said, keeping his eyes
 fixed on the glass case. "Perhaps the artist was a little mad. Eh? What do
 you think? Sometimes it seems to me that man is come where he is not
 wanted, where there is no place for him; for if not, why should he want
 all the place? Why should he run about here and there making a great noise
 about himself, talking about the stars, disturbing the blades of grass? .
 . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Catching butterflies," I chimed in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He smiled, threw himself back in his chair, and stretched his legs. "Sit
 down," he said. "I captured this rare specimen myself one very fine
 morning. And I had a very big emotion. You don't know what it is for a
 collector to capture such a rare specimen. You can't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I smiled at my ease in a rocking-chair. His eyes seemed to look far
 beyond the wall at which they stared; and he narrated how, one night, a
 messenger arrived from his "poor Mohammed," requiring his presence at the
 "residenz"?as he called it?which was distant some nine or ten
 miles by a bridle-path over a cultivated plain, with patches of forest
 here and there. Early in the morning he started from his fortified house,
 after embracing his little Emma, and leaving the "princess," his wife, in
 command. He described how she came with him as far as the gate, walking
 with one hand on the neck of his horse; she had on a white jacket, gold
 pins in her hair, and a brown leather belt over her left shoulder with a
 revolver in it. "She talked as women will talk," he said, "telling me to
 be careful, and to try to get back before dark, and what a great
 wickedness it was for me to go alone. We were at war, and the country was
 not safe; my men were putting up bullet-proof shutters to the house and
 loading their rifles, and she begged me to have no fear for her. She could
 defend the house against anybody till I returned. And I laughed with
 pleasure a little. I liked to see her so brave and young and strong. I too
 was young then. At the gate she caught hold of my hand and gave it one
 squeeze and fell back. I made my horse stand still outside till I heard
 the bars of the gate put up behind me. There was a great enemy of mine, a
 great noble?and a great rascal too?roaming with a band in the
 neighbourhood. I cantered for four or five miles; there had been rain in
 the night, but the musts had gone up, up?and the face of the earth
 was clean; it lay smiling to me, so fresh and innocent?like a little
 child. Suddenly somebody fires a volley?twenty shots at least it
 seemed to me. I hear bullets sing in my ear, and my hat jumps to the back
 of my head. It was a little intrigue, you understand. They got my poor
 Mohammed to send for me and then laid that ambush. I see it all in a
 minute, and I think?This wants a little management. My pony snort,
 jump, and stand, and I fall slowly forward with my head on his mane. He
 begins to walk, and with one eye I could see over his neck a faint cloud
 of smoke hanging in front of a clump of bamboos to my left. I think?Aha!
 my friends, why you not wait long enough before you shoot? This is not yet
 gelungen. Oh no! I get hold of my revolver with my right hand?quiet?quiet.
 After all, there were only seven of these rascals. They get up from the
 grass and start running with their sarongs tucked up, waving spears above
 their heads, and yelling to each other to look out and catch the horse,
 because I was dead. I let them come as close as the door here, and then
 bang, bang, bang?take aim each time too. One more shot I fire at a
 man's back, but I miss. Too far already. And then I sit alone on my horse
 with the clean earth smiling at me, and there are the bodies of three men
 lying on the ground. One was curled up like a dog, another on his back had
 an arm over his eyes as if to keep off the sun, and the third man he draws
 up his leg very slowly and makes it with one kick straight again. I watch
 him very carefully from my horse, but there is no more?bleibt ganz
 ruhig?keep still, so. And as I looked at his face for some sign of
 life I observed something like a faint shadow pass over his forehead. It
 was the shadow of this butterfly. Look at the form of the wing. This
 species fly high with a strong flight. I raised my eyes and I saw him
 fluttering away. I think?Can it be possible? And then I lost him. I
 dismounted and went on very slow, leading my horse and holding my revolver
 with one hand and my eyes darting up and down and right and left,
 everywhere! At last I saw him sitting on a small heap of dirt ten feet
 away. At once my heart began to beat quick. I let go my horse, keep my
 revolver in one hand, and with the other snatch my soft felt hat off my
 head. One step. Steady. Another step. Flop! I got him! When I got up I
 shook like a leaf with excitement, and when I opened these beautiful wings
 and made sure what a rare and so extraordinary perfect specimen I had, my
 head went round and my legs became so weak with emotion that I had to sit
 on the ground. I had greatly desired to possess myself of a specimen of
 that species when collecting for the professor. I took long journeys and
 underwent great privations; I had dreamed of him in my sleep, and here
 suddenly I had him in my fingers?for myself! In the words of the
 poet" (he pronounced it "boet")?
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "'So halt' ich's endlich denn in meinen Handen,
 Und nenn' es in gewissem Sinne mein.'"
</pre>
 <p>
 He gave to the last word the emphasis of a suddenly lowered voice, and
 withdrew his eyes slowly from my face. He began to charge a long-stemmed
 pipe busily and in silence, then, pausing with his thumb on the orifice of
 the bowl, looked again at me significantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Yes, my good friend. On that day I had nothing to desire; I had greatly
 annoyed my principal enemy; I was young, strong; I had friendship; I had
 the love" (he said "lof") "of woman, a child I had, to make my heart very
 full?and even what I had once dreamed in my sleep had come into my
 hand too!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He struck a match, which flared violently. His thoughtful placid face
 twitched once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Friend, wife, child," he said slowly, gazing at the small flame?"phoo!"
 The match was blown out. He sighed and turned again to the glass case. The
 frail and beautiful wings quivered faintly, as if his breath had for an
 instant called back to life that gorgeous object of his dreams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"The work," he began suddenly, pointing to the scattered slips, and in
 his usual gentle and cheery tone, "is making great progress. I have been
 this rare specimen describing. . . . Na! And what is your good news?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"To tell you the truth, Stein," I said with an effort that surprised me,
 "I came here to describe a specimen. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Butterfly?" he asked, with an unbelieving and humorous eagerness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Nothing so perfect," I answered, feeling suddenly dispirited with all
 sorts of doubts. "A man!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Ach so!" he murmured, and his smiling countenance, turned to me, became
 grave. Then after looking at me for a while he said slowly, "Well?I
 am a man too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Here you have him as he was; he knew how to be so generously encouraging
 as to make a scrupulous man hesitate on the brink of confidence; but if I
 did hesitate it was not for long.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He heard me out, sitting with crossed legs. Sometimes his head would
 disappear completely in a great eruption of smoke, and a sympathetic growl
 would come out from the cloud. When I finished he uncrossed his legs, laid
 down his pipe, leaned forward towards me earnestly with his elbows on the
 arms of his chair, the tips of his fingers together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I understand very well. He is romantic."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He had diagnosed the case for me, and at first I was quite startled to
 find how simple it was; and indeed our conference resembled so much a
 medical consultation?Stein, of learned aspect, sitting in an
 arm-chair before his desk; I, anxious, in another, facing him, but a
 little to one side?that it seemed natural to ask?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What's good for it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He lifted up a long forefinger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"There is only one remedy! One thing alone can us from being ourselves
 cure!" The finger came down on the desk with a smart rap. The case which
 he had made to look so simple before became if possible still simpler?and
 altogether hopeless. There was a pause. "Yes," said I, "strictly speaking,
 the question is not how to get cured, but how to live."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He approved with his head, a little sadly as it seemed. "Ja! ja! In
 general, adapting the words of your great poet: That is the question. . .
 ." He went on nodding sympathetically. . . . "How to be! Ach! How to be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He stood up with the tips of his fingers resting on the desk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"We want in so many different ways to be," he began again. "This
 magnificent butterfly finds a little heap of dirt and sits still on it;
 but man he will never on his heap of mud keep still. He want to be so, and
 again he want to be so. . . ." He moved his hand up, then down. . . . "He
 wants to be a saint, and he wants to be a devil?and every time he
 shuts his eyes he sees himself as a very fine fellow?so fine as he
 can never be. . . . In a dream. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He lowered the glass lid, the automatic lock clicked sharply, and taking
 up the case in both hands he bore it religiously away to its place,
 passing out of the bright circle of the lamp into the ring of fainter
 light?into shapeless dusk at last. It had an odd effect?as if
 these few steps had carried him out of this concrete and perplexed world.
 His tall form, as though robbed of its substance, hovered noiselessly over
 invisible things with stooping and indefinite movements; his voice, heard
 in that remoteness where he could be glimpsed mysteriously busy with
 immaterial cares, was no longer incisive, seemed to roll voluminous and
 grave?mellowed by distance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"And because you not always can keep your eyes shut there comes the real
 trouble?the heart pain?the world pain. I tell you, my friend,
 it is not good for you to find you cannot make your dream come true, for
 the reason that you not strong enough are, or not clever enough. . . . Ja!
 . . . And all the time you are such a fine fellow too! Wie? Was? Gott im
 Himmel! How can that be? Ha! ha! ha!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The shadow prowling amongst the graves of butterflies laughed
 boisterously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Yes! Very funny this terrible thing is. A man that is born falls into a
 dream like a man who falls into the sea. If he tries to climb out into the
 air as inexperienced people endeavour to do, he drowns?nicht wahr? .
 . . No! I tell you! The way is to the destructive element submit yourself,
 and with the exertions of your hands and feet in the water make the deep,
 deep sea keep you up. So if you ask me?how to be?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His voice leaped up extraordinarily strong, as though away there in the
 dusk he had been inspired by some whisper of knowledge. "I will tell you!
 For that too there is only one way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'With a hasty swish-swish of his slippers he loomed up in the ring of
 faint light, and suddenly appeared in the bright circle of the lamp. His
 extended hand aimed at my breast like a pistol; his deepset eyes seemed to
 pierce through me, but his twitching lips uttered no word, and the austere
 exaltation of a certitude seen in the dusk vanished from his face. The
 hand that had been pointing at my breast fell, and by-and-by, coming a
 step nearer, he laid it gently on my shoulder. There were things, he said
 mournfully, that perhaps could never be told, only he had lived so much
 alone that sometimes he forgot?he forgot. The light had destroyed
 the assurance which had inspired him in the distant shadows. He sat down
 and, with both elbows on the desk, rubbed his forehead. "And yet it is
 true?it is true. In the destructive element immerse." . . . He spoke
 in a subdued tone, without looking at me, one hand on each side of his
 face. "That was the way. To follow the dream, and again to follow the
 dream?and so?ewig?usque ad finem. . . ." The whisper of
 his conviction seemed to open before me a vast and uncertain expanse, as
 of a crepuscular horizon on a plain at dawn?or was it, perchance, at
 the coming of the night? One had not the courage to decide; but it was a
 charming and deceptive light, throwing the impalpable poesy of its dimness
 over pitfalls?over graves. His life had begun in sacrifice, in
 enthusiasm for generous ideas; he had travelled very far, on various ways,
 on strange paths, and whatever he followed it had been without faltering,
 and therefore without shame and without regret. In so far he was right.
 That was the way, no doubt. Yet for all that, the great plain on which men
 wander amongst graves and pitfalls remained very desolate under the
 impalpable poesy of its crepuscular light, overshadowed in the centre,
 circled with a bright edge as if surrounded by an abyss full of flames.
 When at last I broke the silence it was to express the opinion that no one
 could be more romantic than himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He shook his head slowly, and afterwards looked at me with a patient and
 inquiring glance. It was a shame, he said. There we were sitting and
 talking like two boys, instead of putting our heads together to find
 something practical?a practical remedy?for the evil?for
 the great evil?he repeated, with a humorous and indulgent smile. For
 all that, our talk did not grow more practical. We avoided pronouncing
 Jim's name as though we had tried to keep flesh and blood out of our
 discussion, or he were nothing but an erring spirit, a suffering and
 nameless shade. "Na!" said Stein, rising. "To-night you sleep here, and in
 the morning we shall do something practical?practical. . . ." He lit
 a two-branched candlestick and led the way. We passed through empty dark
 rooms, escorted by gleams from the lights Stein carried. They glided along
 the waxed floors, sweeping here and there over the polished surface of a
 table, leaped upon a fragmentary curve of a piece of furniture, or flashed
 perpendicularly in and out of distant mirrors, while the forms of two men
 and the flicker of two flames could be seen for a moment stealing silently
 across the depths of a crystalline void. He walked slowly a pace in
 advance with stooping courtesy; there was a profound, as it were a
 listening, quietude on his face; the long flaxen locks mixed with white
 threads were scattered thinly upon his slightly bowed neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He is romantic?romantic," he repeated. "And that is very bad?very
 bad. . . . Very good, too," he added. "But <i>is he</i>?" I queried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Gewiss," he said, and stood still holding up the candelabrum, but
 without looking at me. "Evident! What is it that by inward pain makes him
 know himself? What is it that for you and me makes him?exist?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'At that moment it was difficult to believe in Jim's existence?starting
 from a country parsonage, blurred by crowds of men as by clouds of dust,
 silenced by the clashing claims of life and death in a material world?but
 his imperishable reality came to me with a convincing, with an
 irresistible force! I saw it vividly, as though in our progress through
 the lofty silent rooms amongst fleeting gleams of light and the sudden
 revelations of human figures stealing with flickering flames within
 unfathomable and pellucid depths, we had approached nearer to absolute
 Truth, which, like Beauty itself, floats elusive, obscure, half submerged,
 in the silent still waters of mystery. "Perhaps he is," I admitted with a
 slight laugh, whose unexpectedly loud reverberation made me lower my voice
 directly; "but I am sure you are." With his head dropping on his breast
 and the light held high he began to walk again. "Well?I exist, too,"
 he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He preceded me. My eyes followed his movements, but what I did see was
 not the head of the firm, the welcome guest at afternoon receptions, the
 correspondent of learned societies, the entertainer of stray naturalists;
 I saw only the reality of his destiny, which he had known how to follow
 with unfaltering footsteps, that life begun in humble surroundings, rich
 in generous enthusiasms, in friendship, love, war?in all the exalted
 elements of romance. At the door of my room he faced me. "Yes," I said, as
 though carrying on a discussion, "and amongst other things you dreamed
 foolishly of a certain butterfly; but when one fine morning your dream
 came in your way you did not let the splendid opportunity escape. Did you?
 Whereas he . . ." Stein lifted his hand. "And do you know how many
 opportunities I let escape; how many dreams I had lost that had come in my
 way?" He shook his head regretfully. "It seems to me that some would have
 been very fine?if I had made them come true. Do you know how many?
 Perhaps I myself don't know." "Whether his were fine or not," I said, "he
 knows of one which he certainly did not catch." "Everybody knows of one or
 two like that," said Stein; "and that is the trouble?the great
 trouble. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He shook hands on the threshold, peered into my room under his raised
 arm. "Sleep well. And to-morrow we must do something practical?practical.
 . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Though his own room was beyond mine I saw him return the way he came. He
 was going back to his butterflies.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 21
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I don't suppose any of you have ever heard of Patusan?' Marlow resumed,
 after a silence occupied in the careful lighting of a cigar. 'It does not
 matter; there's many a heavenly body in the lot crowding upon us of a
 night that mankind had never heard of, it being outside the sphere of its
 activities and of no earthly importance to anybody but to the astronomers
 who are paid to talk learnedly about its composition, weight, path?the
 irregularities of its conduct, the aberrations of its light?a sort
 of scientific scandal-mongering. Thus with Patusan. It was referred to
 knowingly in the inner government circles in Batavia, especially as to its
 irregularities and aberrations, and it was known by name to some few, very
 few, in the mercantile world. Nobody, however, had been there, and I
 suspect no one desired to go there in person, just as an astronomer, I
 should fancy, would strongly object to being transported into a distant
 heavenly body, where, parted from his earthly emoluments, he would be
 bewildered by the view of an unfamiliar heavens. However, neither heavenly
 bodies nor astronomers have anything to do with Patusan. It was Jim who
 went there. I only meant you to understand that had Stein arranged to send
 him into a star of the fifth magnitude the change could not have been
 greater. He left his earthly failings behind him and what sort of
 reputation he had, and there was a totally new set of conditions for his
 imaginative faculty to work upon. Entirely new, entirely remarkable. And
 he got hold of them in a remarkable way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Stein was the man who knew more about Patusan than anybody else. More
 than was known in the government circles I suspect. I have no doubt he had
 been there, either in his butterfly-hunting days or later on, when he
 tried in his incorrigible way to season with a pinch of romance the
 fattening dishes of his commercial kitchen. There were very few places in
 the Archipelago he had not seen in the original dusk of their being,
 before light (and even electric light) had been carried into them for the
 sake of better morality and?and?well?the greater profit,
 too. It was at breakfast of the morning following our talk about Jim that
 he mentioned the place, after I had quoted poor Brierly's remark: "Let him
 creep twenty feet underground and stay there." He looked up at me with
 interested attention, as though I had been a rare insect. "This could be
 done, too," he remarked, sipping his coffee. "Bury him in some sort," I
 explained. "One doesn't like to do it of course, but it would be the best
 thing, seeing what he is." "Yes; he is young," Stein mused. "The youngest
 human being now in existence," I affirmed. "Schon. There's Patusan," he
 went on in the same tone. . . . "And the woman is dead now," he added
 incomprehensibly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Of course I don't know that story; I can only guess that once before
 Patusan had been used as a grave for some sin, transgression, or
 misfortune. It is impossible to suspect Stein. The only woman that had
 ever existed for him was the Malay girl he called "My wife the princess,"
 or, more rarely, in moments of expansion, "the mother of my Emma." Who was
 the woman he had mentioned in connection with Patusan I can't say; but
 from his allusions I understand she had been an educated and very
 good-looking Dutch-Malay girl, with a tragic or perhaps only a pitiful
 history, whose most painful part no doubt was her marriage with a Malacca
 Portuguese who had been clerk in some commercial house in the Dutch
 colonies. I gathered from Stein that this man was an unsatisfactory person
 in more ways than one, all being more or less indefinite and offensive. It
 was solely for his wife's sake that Stein had appointed him manager of
 Stein &amp; Co.'s trading post in Patusan; but commercially the
 arrangement was not a success, at any rate for the firm, and now the woman
 had died, Stein was disposed to try another agent there. The Portuguese,
 whose name was Cornelius, considered himself a very deserving but ill-used
 person, entitled by his abilities to a better position. This man Jim would
 have to relieve. "But I don't think he will go away from the place,"
 remarked Stein. "That has nothing to do with me. It was only for the sake
 of the woman that I . . . But as I think there is a daughter left, I shall
 let him, if he likes to stay, keep the old house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Patusan is a remote district of a native-ruled state, and the chief
 settlement bears the same name. At a point on the river about forty miles
 from the sea, where the first houses come into view, there can be seen
 rising above the level of the forests the summits of two steep hills very
 close together, and separated by what looks like a deep fissure, the
 cleavage of some mighty stroke. As a matter of fact, the valley between is
 nothing but a narrow ravine; the appearance from the settlement is of one
 irregularly conical hill split in two, and with the two halves leaning
 slightly apart. On the third day after the full, the moon, as seen from
 the open space in front of Jim's house (he had a very fine house in the
 native style when I visited him), rose exactly behind these hills, its
 diffused light at first throwing the two masses into intensely black
 relief, and then the nearly perfect disc, glowing ruddily, appeared,
 gliding upwards between the sides of the chasm, till it floated away above
 the summits, as if escaping from a yawning grave in gentle triumph.
 "Wonderful effect," said Jim by my side. "Worth seeing. Is it not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And this question was put with a note of personal pride that made me
 smile, as though he had had a hand in regulating that unique spectacle. He
 had regulated so many things in Patusan?things that would have
 appeared as much beyond his control as the motions of the moon and the
 stars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was inconceivable. That was the distinctive quality of the part into
 which Stein and I had tumbled him unwittingly, with no other notion than
 to get him out of the way; out of his own way, be it understood. That was
 our main purpose, though, I own, I might have had another motive which had
 influenced me a little. I was about to go home for a time; and it may be I
 desired, more than I was aware of myself, to dispose of him?to
 dispose of him, you understand?before I left. I was going home, and
 he had come to me from there, with his miserable trouble and his shadowy
 claim, like a man panting under a burden in a mist. I cannot say I had
 ever seen him distinctly?not even to this day, after I had my last
 view of him; but it seemed to me that the less I understood the more I was
 bound to him in the name of that doubt which is the inseparable part of
 our knowledge. I did not know so much more about myself. And then, I
 repeat, I was going home?to that home distant enough for all its
 hearthstones to be like one hearthstone, by which the humblest of us has
 the right to sit. We wander in our thousands over the face of the earth,
 the illustrious and the obscure, earning beyond the seas our fame, our
 money, or only a crust of bread; but it seems to me that for each of us
 going home must be like going to render an account. We return to face our
 superiors, our kindred, our friends?those whom we obey, and those
 whom we love; but even they who have neither, the most free, lonely,
 irresponsible and bereft of ties,?even those for whom home holds no
 dear face, no familiar voice,?even they have to meet the spirit that
 dwells within the land, under its sky, in its air, in its valleys, and on
 its rises, in its fields, in its waters and its trees?a mute friend,
 judge, and inspirer. Say what you like, to get its joy, to breathe its
 peace, to face its truth, one must return with a clear conscience. All
 this may seem to you sheer sentimentalism; and indeed very few of us have
 the will or the capacity to look consciously under the surface of familiar
 emotions. There are the girls we love, the men we look up to, the
 tenderness, the friendships, the opportunities, the pleasures! But the
 fact remains that you must touch your reward with clean hands, lest it
 turn to dead leaves, to thorns, in your grasp. I think it is the lonely,
 without a fireside or an affection they may call their own, those who
 return not to a dwelling but to the land itself, to meet its disembodied,
 eternal, and unchangeable spirit?it is those who understand best its
 severity, its saving power, the grace of its secular right to our
 fidelity, to our obedience. Yes! few of us understand, but we all feel it
 though, and I say <i>all</i> without exception, because those who do not
 feel do not count. Each blade of grass has its spot on earth whence it
 draws its life, its strength; and so is man rooted to the land from which
 he draws his faith together with his life. I don't know how much Jim
 understood; but I know he felt, he felt confusedly but powerfully, the
 demand of some such truth or some such illusion?I don't care how you
 call it, there is so little difference, and the difference means so
 little. The thing is that in virtue of his feeling he mattered. He would
 never go home now. Not he. Never. Had he been capable of picturesque
 manifestations he would have shuddered at the thought and made you shudder
 too. But he was not of that sort, though he was expressive enough in his
 way. Before the idea of going home he would grow desperately stiff and
 immovable, with lowered chin and pouted lips, and with those candid blue
 eyes of his glowering darkly under a frown, as if before something
 unbearable, as if before something revolting. There was imagination in
 that hard skull of his, over which the thick clustering hair fitted like a
 cap. As to me, I have no imagination (I would be more certain about him
 today, if I had), and I do not mean to imply that I figured to myself the
 spirit of the land uprising above the white cliffs of Dover, to ask me
 what I?returning with no bones broken, so to speak?had done
 with my very young brother. I could not make such a mistake. I knew very
 well he was of those about whom there is no inquiry; I had seen better men
 go out, disappear, vanish utterly, without provoking a sound of curiosity
 or sorrow. The spirit of the land, as becomes the ruler of great
 enterprises, is careless of innumerable lives. Woe to the stragglers! We
 exist only in so far as we hang together. He had straggled in a way; he
 had not hung on; but he was aware of it with an intensity that made him
 touching, just as a man's more intense life makes his death more touching
 than the death of a tree. I happened to be handy, and I happened to be
 touched. That's all there is to it. I was concerned as to the way he would
 go out. It would have hurt me if, for instance, he had taken to drink. The
 earth is so small that I was afraid of, some day, being waylaid by a
 blear-eyed, swollen-faced, besmirched loafer, with no soles to his canvas
 shoes, and with a flutter of rags about the elbows, who, on the strength
 of old acquaintance, would ask for a loan of five dollars. You know the
 awful jaunty bearing of these scarecrows coming to you from a decent past,
 the rasping careless voice, the half-averted impudent glances?those
 meetings more trying to a man who believes in the solidarity of our lives
 than the sight of an impenitent death-bed to a priest. That, to tell you
 the truth, was the only danger I could see for him and for me; but I also
 mistrusted my want of imagination. It might even come to something worse,
 in some way it was beyond my powers of fancy to foresee. He wouldn't let
 me forget how imaginative he was, and your imaginative people swing
 farther in any direction, as if given a longer scope of cable in the
 uneasy anchorage of life. They do. They take to drink too. It may be I was
 belittling him by such a fear. How could I tell? Even Stein could say no
 more than that he was romantic. I only knew he was one of us. And what
 business had he to be romantic? I am telling you so much about my own
 instinctive feelings and bemused reflections because there remains so
 little to be told of him. He existed for me, and after all it is only
 through me that he exists for you. I've led him out by the hand; I have
 paraded him before you. Were my commonplace fears unjust? I won't say?not
 even now. You may be able to tell better, since the proverb has it that
 the onlookers see most of the game. At any rate, they were superfluous. He
 did not go out, not at all; on the contrary, he came on wonderfully, came
 on straight as a die and in excellent form, which showed that he could
 stay as well as spurt. I ought to be delighted, for it is a victory in
 which I had taken my part; but I am not so pleased as I would have
 expected to be. I ask myself whether his rush had really carried him out
 of that mist in which he loomed interesting if not very big, with floating
 outlines?a straggler yearning inconsolably for his humble place in
 the ranks. And besides, the last word is not said,?probably shall
 never be said. Are not our lives too short for that full utterance which
 through all our stammerings is of course our only and abiding intention? I
 have given up expecting those last words, whose ring, if they could only
 be pronounced, would shake both heaven and earth. There is never time to
 say our last word?the last word of our love, of our desire, faith,
 remorse, submissions, revolt. The heaven and the earth must not be shaken,
 I suppose?at least, not by us who know so many truths about either.
 My last words about Jim shall be few. I affirm he had achieved greatness;
 but the thing would be dwarfed in the telling, or rather in the hearing.
 Frankly, it is not my words that I mistrust but your minds. I could be
 eloquent were I not afraid you fellows had starved your imaginations to
 feed your bodies. I do not mean to be offensive; it is respectable to have
 no illusions?and safe?and profitable?and dull. Yet you,
 too, in your time must have known the intensity of life, that light of
 glamour created in the shock of trifles, as amazing as the glow of sparks
 struck from a cold stone?and as short-lived, alas!'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 22
 </h2>
 <p>
 'The conquest of love, honour, men's confidence?the pride of it, the
 power of it, are fit materials for a heroic tale; only our minds are
 struck by the externals of such a success, and to Jim's successes there
 were no externals. Thirty miles of forest shut it off from the sight of an
 indifferent world, and the noise of the white surf along the coast
 overpowered the voice of fame. The stream of civilisation, as if divided
 on a headland a hundred miles north of Patusan, branches east and
 south-east, leaving its plains and valleys, its old trees and its old
 mankind, neglected and isolated, such as an insignificant and crumbling
 islet between the two branches of a mighty, devouring stream. You find the
 name of the country pretty often in collections of old voyages. The
 seventeenth-century traders went there for pepper, because the passion for
 pepper seemed to burn like a flame of love in the breast of Dutch and
 English adventurers about the time of James the First. Where wouldn't they
 go for pepper! For a bag of pepper they would cut each other's throats
 without hesitation, and would forswear their souls, of which they were so
 careful otherwise: the bizarre obstinacy of that desire made them defy
 death in a thousand shapes?the unknown seas, the loathsome and
 strange diseases; wounds, captivity, hunger, pestilence, and despair. It
 made them great! By heavens! it made them heroic; and it made them
 pathetic too in their craving for trade with the inflexible death levying
 its toll on young and old. It seems impossible to believe that mere greed
 could hold men to such a steadfastness of purpose, to such a blind
 persistence in endeavour and sacrifice. And indeed those who adventured
 their persons and lives risked all they had for a slender reward. They
 left their bones to lie bleaching on distant shores, so that wealth might
 flow to the living at home. To us, their less tried successors, they
 appear magnified, not as agents of trade but as instruments of a recorded
 destiny, pushing out into the unknown in obedience to an inward voice, to
 an impulse beating in the blood, to a dream of the future. They were
 wonderful; and it must be owned they were ready for the wonderful. They
 recorded it complacently in their sufferings, in the aspect of the seas,
 in the customs of strange nations, in the glory of splendid rulers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In Patusan they had found lots of pepper, and had been impressed by the
 magnificence and the wisdom of the Sultan; but somehow, after a century of
 chequered intercourse, the country seems to drop gradually out of the
 trade. Perhaps the pepper had given out. Be it as it may, nobody cares for
 it now; the glory has departed, the Sultan is an imbecile youth with two
 thumbs on his left hand and an uncertain and beggarly revenue extorted
 from a miserable population and stolen from him by his many uncles.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This of course I have from Stein. He gave me their names and a short
 sketch of the life and character of each. He was as full of information
 about native states as an official report, but infinitely more amusing. He
 <i>had</i> to know. He traded in so many, and in some districts?as
 in Patusan, for instance?his firm was the only one to have an agency
 by special permit from the Dutch authorities. The Government trusted his
 discretion, and it was understood that he took all the risks. The men he
 employed understood that too, but he made it worth their while apparently.
 He was perfectly frank with me over the breakfast-table in the morning. As
 far as he was aware (the last news was thirteen months old, he stated
 precisely), utter insecurity for life and property was the normal
 condition. There were in Patusan antagonistic forces, and one of them was
 Rajah Allang, the worst of the Sultan's uncles, the governor of the river,
 who did the extorting and the stealing, and ground down to the point of
 extinction the country-born Malays, who, utterly defenceless, had not even
 the resource of emigrating?"For indeed," as Stein remarked, "where
 could they go, and how could they get away?" No doubt they did not even
 desire to get away. The world (which is circumscribed by lofty impassable
 mountains) has been given into the hand of the high-born, and <i>this</i>
 Rajah they knew: he was of their own royal house. I had the pleasure of
 meeting the gentleman later on. He was a dirty, little, used-up old man
 with evil eyes and a weak mouth, who swallowed an opium pill every two
 hours, and in defiance of common decency wore his hair uncovered and
 falling in wild stringy locks about his wizened grimy face. When giving
 audience he would clamber upon a sort of narrow stage erected in a hall
 like a ruinous barn with a rotten bamboo floor, through the cracks of
 which you could see, twelve or fifteen feet below, the heaps of refuse and
 garbage of all kinds lying under the house. That is where and how he
 received us when, accompanied by Jim, I paid him a visit of ceremony.
 There were about forty people in the room, and perhaps three times as many
 in the great courtyard below. There was constant movement, coming and
 going, pushing and murmuring, at our backs. A few youths in gay silks
 glared from the distance; the majority, slaves and humble dependants, were
 half naked, in ragged sarongs, dirty with ashes and mud-stains. I had
 never seen Jim look so grave, so self-possessed, in an impenetrable,
 impressive way. In the midst of these dark-faced men, his stalwart figure
 in white apparel, the gleaming clusters of his fair hair, seemed to catch
 all the sunshine that trickled through the cracks in the closed shutters
 of that dim hall, with its walls of mats and a roof of thatch. He appeared
 like a creature not only of another kind but of another essence. Had they
 not seen him come up in a canoe they might have thought he had descended
 upon them from the clouds. He did, however, come in a crazy dug-out,
 sitting (very still and with his knees together, for fear of overturning
 the thing)?sitting on a tin box?which I had lent him?nursing
 on his lap a revolver of the Navy pattern?presented by me on parting?which,
 through an interposition of Providence, or through some wrong-headed
 notion, that was just like him, or else from sheer instinctive sagacity,
 he had decided to carry unloaded. That's how he ascended the Patusan
 river. Nothing could have been more prosaic and more unsafe, more
 extravagantly casual, more lonely. Strange, this fatality that would cast
 the complexion of a flight upon all his acts, of impulsive unreflecting
 desertion of a jump into the unknown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It is precisely the casualness of it that strikes me most. Neither Stein
 nor I had a clear conception of what might be on the other side when we,
 metaphorically speaking, took him up and hove him over the wall with scant
 ceremony. At the moment I merely wished to achieve his disappearance;
 Stein characteristically enough had a sentimental motive. He had a notion
 of paying off (in kind, I suppose) the old debt he had never forgotten.
 Indeed he had been all his life especially friendly to anybody from the
 British Isles. His late benefactor, it is true, was a Scot?even to
 the length of being called Alexander McNeil?and Jim came from a long
 way south of the Tweed; but at the distance of six or seven thousand miles
 Great Britain, though never diminished, looks foreshortened enough even to
 its own children to rob such details of their importance. Stein was
 excusable, and his hinted intentions were so generous that I begged him
 most earnestly to keep them secret for a time. I felt that no
 consideration of personal advantage should be allowed to influence Jim;
 that not even the risk of such influence should be run. We had to deal
 with another sort of reality. He wanted a refuge, and a refuge at the cost
 of danger should be offered him?nothing more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Upon every other point I was perfectly frank with him, and I even (as I
 believed at the time) exaggerated the danger of the undertaking. As a
 matter of fact I did not do it justice; his first day in Patusan was
 nearly his last?would have been his last if he had not been so
 reckless or so hard on himself and had condescended to load that revolver.
 I remember, as I unfolded our precious scheme for his retreat, how his
 stubborn but weary resignation was gradually replaced by surprise,
 interest, wonder, and by boyish eagerness. This was a chance he had been
 dreaming of. He couldn't think how he merited that I . . . He would be
 shot if he could see to what he owed . . . And it was Stein, Stein the
 merchant, who . . . but of course it was me he had to . . . I cut him
 short. He was not articulate, and his gratitude caused me inexplicable
 pain. I told him that if he owed this chance to any one especially, it was
 to an old Scot of whom he had never heard, who had died many years ago, of
 whom little was remembered besides a roaring voice and a rough sort of
 honesty. There was really no one to receive his thanks. Stein was passing
 on to a young man the help he had received in his own young days, and I
 had done no more than to mention his name. Upon this he coloured, and,
 twisting a bit of paper in his fingers, he remarked bashfully that I had
 always trusted him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I admitted that such was the case, and added after a pause that I wished
 he had been able to follow my example. "You think I don't?" he asked
 uneasily, and remarked in a mutter that one had to get some sort of show
 first; then brightening up, and in a loud voice he protested he would give
 me no occasion to regret my confidence, which?which . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Do not misapprehend," I interrupted. "It is not in your power to make me
 regret anything." There would be no regrets; but if there were, it would
 be altogether my own affair: on the other hand, I wished him to understand
 clearly that this arrangement, this?this?experiment, was his
 own doing; he was responsible for it and no one else. "Why? Why," he
 stammered, "this is the very thing that I . . ." I begged him not to be
 dense, and he looked more puzzled than ever. He was in a fair way to make
 life intolerable to himself . . . "Do you think so?" he asked, disturbed;
 but in a moment added confidently, "I was going on though. Was I not?" It
 was impossible to be angry with him: I could not help a smile, and told
 him that in the old days people who went on like this were on the way of
 becoming hermits in a wilderness. "Hermits be hanged!" he commented with
 engaging impulsiveness. Of course he didn't mind a wilderness. . . . "I
 was glad of it," I said. That was where he would be going to. He would
 find it lively enough, I ventured to promise. "Yes, yes," he said, keenly.
 He had shown a desire, I continued inflexibly, to go out and shut the door
 after him. . . . "Did I?" he interrupted in a strange access of gloom that
 seemed to envelop him from head to foot like the shadow of a passing
 cloud. He was wonderfully expressive after all. Wonderfully! "Did I?" he
 repeated bitterly. "You can't say I made much noise about it. And I can
 keep it up, too?only, confound it! you show me a door." . . . "Very
 well. Pass on," I struck in. I could make him a solemn promise that it
 would be shut behind him with a vengeance. His fate, whatever it was,
 would be ignored, because the country, for all its rotten state, was not
 judged ripe for interference. Once he got in, it would be for the outside
 world as though he had never existed. He would have nothing but the soles
 of his two feet to stand upon, and he would have first to find his ground
 at that. "Never existed?that's it, by Jove," he murmured to himself.
 His eyes, fastened upon my lips, sparkled. If he had thoroughly understood
 the conditions, I concluded, he had better jump into the first gharry he
 could see and drive on to Stein's house for his final instructions. He
 flung out of the room before I had fairly finished speaking.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 23
 </h2>
 <p>
 'He did not return till next morning. He had been kept to dinner and for
 the night. There never had been such a wonderful man as Mr. Stein. He had
 in his pocket a letter for Cornelius ("the Johnnie who's going to get the
 sack," he explained, with a momentary drop in his elation), and he
 exhibited with glee a silver ring, such as natives use, worn down very
 thin and showing faint traces of chasing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This was his introduction to an old chap called Doramin?one of the
 principal men out there?a big pot?who had been Mr. Stein's
 friend in that country where he had all these adventures. Mr. Stein called
 him "war-comrade." War-comrade was good. Wasn't it? And didn't Mr. Stein
 speak English wonderfully well? Said he had learned it in Celebes?of
 all places! That was awfully funny. Was it not? He did speak with an
 accent?a twang?did I notice? That chap Doramin had given him
 the ring. They had exchanged presents when they parted for the last time.
 Sort of promising eternal friendship. He called it fine?did I not?
 They had to make a dash for dear life out of the country when that
 Mohammed?Mohammed?What's-his-name had been killed. I knew the
 story, of course. Seemed a beastly shame, didn't it? . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He ran on like this, forgetting his plate, with a knife and fork in hand
 (he had found me at tiffin), slightly flushed, and with his eyes darkened
 many shades, which was with him a sign of excitement. The ring was a sort
 of credential?("It's like something you read of in books," he threw
 in appreciatively)?and Doramin would do his best for him. Mr. Stein
 had been the means of saving that chap's life on some occasion; purely by
 accident, Mr. Stein had said, but he?Jim?had his own opinion
 about that. Mr. Stein was just the man to look out for such accidents. No
 matter. Accident or purpose, this would serve his turn immensely. Hoped to
 goodness the jolly old beggar had not gone off the hooks meantime. Mr.
 Stein could not tell. There had been no news for more than a year; they
 were kicking up no end of an all-fired row amongst themselves, and the
 river was closed. Jolly awkward, this; but, no fear; he would manage to
 find a crack to get in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He impressed, almost frightened, me with his elated rattle. He was
 voluble like a youngster on the eve of a long holiday with a prospect of
 delightful scrapes, and such an attitude of mind in a grown man and in
 this connection had in it something phenomenal, a little mad, dangerous,
 unsafe. I was on the point of entreating him to take things seriously when
 he dropped his knife and fork (he had begun eating, or rather swallowing
 food, as it were, unconsciously), and began a search all round his plate.
 The ring! The ring! Where the devil . . . Ah! Here it was . . . He closed
 his big hand on it, and tried all his pockets one after another. Jove!
 wouldn't do to lose the thing. He meditated gravely over his fist. Had it?
 Would hang the bally affair round his neck! And he proceeded to do this
 immediately, producing a string (which looked like a bit of a cotton
 shoe-lace) for the purpose. There! That would do the trick! It would be
 the deuce if . . . He seemed to catch sight of my face for the first time,
 and it steadied him a little. I probably didn't realise, he said with a
 naive gravity, how much importance he attached to that token. It meant a
 friend; and it is a good thing to have a friend. He knew something about
 that. He nodded at me expressively, but before my disclaiming gesture he
 leaned his head on his hand and for a while sat silent, playing
 thoughtfully with the bread-crumbs on the cloth . . . "Slam the door?that
 was jolly well put," he cried, and jumping up, began to pace the room,
 reminding me by the set of the shoulders, the turn of his head, the
 headlong and uneven stride, of that night when he had paced thus,
 confessing, explaining?what you will?but, in the last
 instance, living?living before me, under his own little cloud, with
 all his unconscious subtlety which could draw consolation from the very
 source of sorrow. It was the same mood, the same and different, like a
 fickle companion that to-day guiding you on the true path, with the same
 eyes, the same step, the same impulse, to-morrow will lead you hopelessly
 astray. His tread was assured, his straying, darkened eyes seemed to
 search the room for something. One of his footfalls somehow sounded louder
 than the other?the fault of his boots probably?and gave a
 curious impression of an invisible halt in his gait. One of his hands was
 rammed deep into his trousers' pocket, the other waved suddenly above his
 head. "Slam the door!" he shouted. "I've been waiting for that. I'll show
 yet . . . I'll . . . I'm ready for any confounded thing . . . I've been
 dreaming of it . . . Jove! Get out of this. Jove! This is luck at last . .
 . You wait. I'll . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He tossed his head fearlessly, and I confess that for the first and last
 time in our acquaintance I perceived myself unexpectedly to be thoroughly
 sick of him. Why these vapourings? He was stumping about the room
 flourishing his arm absurdly, and now and then feeling on his breast for
 the ring under his clothes. Where was the sense of such exaltation in a
 man appointed to be a trading-clerk, and in a place where there was no
 trade?at that? Why hurl defiance at the universe? This was not a
 proper frame of mind to approach any undertaking; an improper frame of
 mind not only for him, I said, but for any man. He stood still over me.
 Did I think so? he asked, by no means subdued, and with a smile in which I
 seemed to detect suddenly something insolent. But then I am twenty years
 his senior. Youth is insolent; it is its right?its necessity; it has
 got to assert itself, and all assertion in this world of doubts is a
 defiance, is an insolence. He went off into a far corner, and coming back,
 he, figuratively speaking, turned to rend me. I spoke like that because I?even
 I, who had been no end kind to him?even I remembered?remembered?against
 him?what?what had happened. And what about others?the?the?world?
 Where's the wonder he wanted to get out, meant to get out, meant to stay
 out?by heavens! And I talked about proper frames of mind!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It is not I or the world who remember," I shouted. "It is you?you,
 who remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He did not flinch, and went on with heat, "Forget everything, everybody,
 everybody." . . . His voice fell. . . "But you," he added.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Yes?me too?if it would help," I said, also in a low tone.
 After this we remained silent and languid for a time as if exhausted. Then
 he began again, composedly, and told me that Mr. Stein had instructed him
 to wait for a month or so, to see whether it was possible for him to
 remain, before he began building a new house for himself, so as to avoid
 "vain expense." He did make use of funny expressions?Stein did.
 "Vain expense" was good. . . . Remain? Why! of course. He would hang on.
 Let him only get in?that's all; he would answer for it he would
 remain. Never get out. It was easy enough to remain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Don't be foolhardy," I said, rendered uneasy by his threatening tone.
 "If you only live long enough you will want to come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Come back to what?" he asked absently, with his eyes fixed upon the face
 of a clock on the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was silent for a while. "Is it to be never, then?" I said. "Never," he
 repeated dreamily without looking at me, and then flew into sudden
 activity. "Jove! Two o'clock, and I sail at four!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was true. A brigantine of Stein's was leaving for the westward that
 afternoon, and he had been instructed to take his passage in her, only no
 orders to delay the sailing had been given. I suppose Stein forgot. He
 made a rush to get his things while I went aboard my ship, where he
 promised to call on his way to the outer roadstead. He turned up
 accordingly in a great hurry and with a small leather valise in his hand.
 This wouldn't do, and I offered him an old tin trunk of mine supposed to
 be water-tight, or at least damp-tight. He effected the transfer by the
 simple process of shooting out the contents of his valise as you would
 empty a sack of wheat. I saw three books in the tumble; two small, in dark
 covers, and a thick green-and-gold volume?a half-crown complete
 Shakespeare. "You read this?" I asked. "Yes. Best thing to cheer up a
 fellow," he said hastily. I was struck by this appreciation, but there was
 no time for Shakespearian talk. A heavy revolver and two small boxes of
 cartridges were lying on the cuddy-table. "Pray take this," I said. "It
 may help you to remain." No sooner were these words out of my mouth than I
 perceived what grim meaning they could bear. "May help you to get in," I
 corrected myself remorsefully. He however was not troubled by obscure
 meanings; he thanked me effusively and bolted out, calling Good-bye over
 his shoulder. I heard his voice through the ship's side urging his boatmen
 to give way, and looking out of the stern-port I saw the boat rounding
 under the counter. He sat in her leaning forward, exciting his men with
 voice and gestures; and as he had kept the revolver in his hand and seemed
 to be presenting it at their heads, I shall never forget the scared faces
 of the four Javanese, and the frantic swing of their stroke which snatched
 that vision from under my eyes. Then turning away, the first thing I saw
 were the two boxes of cartridges on the cuddy-table. He had forgotten to
 take them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I ordered my gig manned at once; but Jim's rowers, under the impression
 that their lives hung on a thread while they had that madman in the boat,
 made such excellent time that before I had traversed half the distance
 between the two vessels I caught sight of him clambering over the rail,
 and of his box being passed up. All the brigantine's canvas was loose, her
 mainsail was set, and the windlass was just beginning to clink as I
 stepped upon her deck: her master, a dapper little half-caste of forty or
 so, in a blue flannel suit, with lively eyes, his round face the colour of
 lemon-peel, and with a thin little black moustache drooping on each side
 of his thick, dark lips, came forward smirking. He turned out,
 notwithstanding his self-satisfied and cheery exterior, to be of a
 careworn temperament. In answer to a remark of mine (while Jim had gone
 below for a moment) he said, "Oh yes. Patusan." He was going to carry the
 gentleman to the mouth of the river, but would "never ascend." His flowing
 English seemed to be derived from a dictionary compiled by a lunatic. Had
 Mr. Stein desired him to "ascend," he would have "reverentially"?(I
 think he wanted to say respectfully?but devil only knows)?"reverentially
 made objects for the safety of properties." If disregarded, he would have
 presented "resignation to quit." Twelve months ago he had made his last
 voyage there, and though Mr. Cornelius "propitiated many offertories" to
 Mr. Rajah Allang and the "principal populations," on conditions which made
 the trade "a snare and ashes in the mouth," yet his ship had been fired
 upon from the woods by "irresponsive parties" all the way down the river;
 which causing his crew "from exposure to limb to remain silent in
 hidings," the brigantine was nearly stranded on a sandbank at the bar,
 where she "would have been perishable beyond the act of man." The angry
 disgust at the recollection, the pride of his fluency, to which he turned
 an attentive ear, struggled for the possession of his broad simple face.
 He scowled and beamed at me, and watched with satisfaction the undeniable
 effect of his phraseology. Dark frowns ran swiftly over the placid sea,
 and the brigantine, with her fore-topsail to the mast and her main-boom
 amidships, seemed bewildered amongst the cat's-paws. He told me further,
 gnashing his teeth, that the Rajah was a "laughable hyaena" (can't imagine
 how he got hold of hyaenas); while somebody else was many times falser
 than the "weapons of a crocodile." Keeping one eye on the movements of his
 crew forward, he let loose his volubility?comparing the place to a
 "cage of beasts made ravenous by long impenitence." I fancy he meant
 impunity. He had no intention, he cried, to "exhibit himself to be made
 attached purposefully to robbery." The long-drawn wails, giving the time
 for the pull of the men catting the anchor, came to an end, and he lowered
 his voice. "Plenty too much enough of Patusan," he concluded, with energy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I heard afterwards he had been so indiscreet as to get himself tied up by
 the neck with a rattan halter to a post planted in the middle of a
 mud-hole before the Rajah's house. He spent the best part of a day and a
 whole night in that unwholesome situation, but there is every reason to
 believe the thing had been meant as a sort of joke. He brooded for a while
 over that horrid memory, I suppose, and then addressed in a quarrelsome
 tone the man coming aft to the helm. When he turned to me again it was to
 speak judicially, without passion. He would take the gentleman to the
 mouth of the river at Batu Kring (Patusan town "being situated
 internally," he remarked, "thirty miles"). But in his eyes, he continued?a
 tone of bored, weary conviction replacing his previous voluble delivery?the
 gentleman was already "in the similitude of a corpse." "What? What do you
 say?" I asked. He assumed a startlingly ferocious demeanour, and imitated
 to perfection the act of stabbing from behind. "Already like the body of
 one deported," he explained, with the insufferably conceited air of his
 kind after what they imagine a display of cleverness. Behind him I
 perceived Jim smiling silently at me, and with a raised hand checking the
 exclamation on my lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Then, while the half-caste, bursting with importance, shouted his orders,
 while the yards swung creaking and the heavy boom came surging over, Jim
 and I, alone as it were, to leeward of the mainsail, clasped each other's
 hands and exchanged the last hurried words. My heart was freed from that
 dull resentment which had existed side by side with interest in his fate.
 The absurd chatter of the half-caste had given more reality to the
 miserable dangers of his path than Stein's careful statements. On that
 occasion the sort of formality that had been always present in our
 intercourse vanished from our speech; I believe I called him "dear boy,"
 and he tacked on the words "old man" to some half-uttered expression of
 gratitude, as though his risk set off against my years had made us more
 equal in age and in feeling. There was a moment of real and profound
 intimacy, unexpected and short-lived like a glimpse of some everlasting,
 of some saving truth. He exerted himself to soothe me as though he had
 been the more mature of the two. "All right, all right," he said, rapidly,
 and with feeling. "I promise to take care of myself. Yes; I won't take any
 risks. Not a single blessed risk. Of course not. I mean to hang out. Don't
 you worry. Jove! I feel as if nothing could touch me. Why! this is luck
 from the word Go. I wouldn't spoil such a magnificent chance!" . . . A
 magnificent chance! Well, it <i>was</i> magnificent, but chances are what
 men make them, and how was I to know? As he had said, even I?even I
 remembered?his?his misfortune against him. It was true. And
 the best thing for him was to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'My gig had dropped in the wake of the brigantine, and I saw him aft
 detached upon the light of the westering sun, raising his cap high above
 his head. I heard an indistinct shout, "You?shall?hear?of?me."
 Of me, or from me, I don't know which. I think it must have been of me. My
 eyes were too dazzled by the glitter of the sea below his feet to see him
 clearly; I am fated never to see him clearly; but I can assure you no man
 could have appeared less "in the similitude of a corpse," as that
 half-caste croaker had put it. I could see the little wretch's face, the
 shape and colour of a ripe pumpkin, poked out somewhere under Jim's elbow.
 He, too, raised his arm as if for a downward thrust. Absit omen!'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 24
 </h2>
 <p>
 'The coast of Patusan (I saw it nearly two years afterwards) is straight
 and sombre, and faces a misty ocean. Red trails are seen like cataracts of
 rust streaming under the dark-green foliage of bushes and creepers
 clothing the low cliffs. Swampy plains open out at the mouth of rivers,
 with a view of jagged blue peaks beyond the vast forests. In the offing a
 chain of islands, dark, crumbling shapes, stand out in the everlasting
 sunlit haze like the remnants of a wall breached by the sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There is a village of fisher-folk at the mouth of the Batu Kring branch
 of the estuary. The river, which had been closed so long, was open then,
 and Stein's little schooner, in which I had my passage, worked her way up
 in three tides without being exposed to a fusillade from "irresponsive
 parties." Such a state of affairs belonged already to ancient history, if
 I could believe the elderly headman of the fishing village, who came on
 board to act as a sort of pilot. He talked to me (the second white man he
 had ever seen) with confidence, and most of his talk was about the first
 white man he had ever seen. He called him Tuan Jim, and the tone of his
 references was made remarkable by a strange mixture of familiarity and
 awe. They, in the village, were under that lord's special protection,
 which showed that Jim bore no grudge. If he had warned me that I would
 hear of him it was perfectly true. I was hearing of him. There was already
 a story that the tide had turned two hours before its time to help him on
 his journey up the river. The talkative old man himself had steered the
 canoe and had marvelled at the phenomenon. Moreover, all the glory was in
 his family. His son and his son-in-law had paddled; but they were only
 youths without experience, who did not notice the speed of the canoe till
 he pointed out to them the amazing fact.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim's coming to that fishing village was a blessing; but to them, as to
 many of us, the blessing came heralded by terrors. So many generations had
 been released since the last white man had visited the river that the very
 tradition had been lost. The appearance of the being that descended upon
 them and demanded inflexibly to be taken up to Patusan was discomposing;
 his insistence was alarming; his generosity more than suspicious. It was
 an unheard-of request. There was no precedent. What would the Rajah say to
 this? What would he do to them? The best part of the night was spent in
 consultation; but the immediate risk from the anger of that strange man
 seemed so great that at last a cranky dug-out was got ready. The women
 shrieked with grief as it put off. A fearless old hag cursed the stranger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He sat in it, as I've told you, on his tin box, nursing the unloaded
 revolver on his lap. He sat with precaution?than which there is
 nothing more fatiguing?and thus entered the land he was destined to
 fill with the fame of his virtues, from the blue peaks inland to the white
 ribbon of surf on the coast. At the first bend he lost sight of the sea
 with its labouring waves for ever rising, sinking, and vanishing to rise
 again?the very image of struggling mankind?and faced the
 immovable forests rooted deep in the soil, soaring towards the sunshine,
 everlasting in the shadowy might of their tradition, like life itself. And
 his opportunity sat veiled by his side like an Eastern bride waiting to be
 uncovered by the hand of the master. He too was the heir of a shadowy and
 mighty tradition! He told me, however, that he had never in his life felt
 so depressed and tired as in that canoe. All the movement he dared to
 allow himself was to reach, as it were by stealth, after the shell of half
 a cocoa-nut floating between his shoes, and bale some of the water out
 with a carefully restrained action. He discovered how hard the lid of a
 block-tin case was to sit upon. He had heroic health; but several times
 during that journey he experienced fits of giddiness, and between whiles
 he speculated hazily as to the size of the blister the sun was raising on
 his back. For amusement he tried by looking ahead to decide whether the
 muddy object he saw lying on the water's edge was a log of wood or an
 alligator. Only very soon he had to give that up. No fun in it. Always
 alligator. One of them flopped into the river and all but capsized the
 canoe. But this excitement was over directly. Then in a long empty reach
 he was very grateful to a troop of monkeys who came right down on the bank
 and made an insulting hullabaloo on his passage. Such was the way in which
 he was approaching greatness as genuine as any man ever achieved.
 Principally, he longed for sunset; and meantime his three paddlers were
 preparing to put into execution their plan of delivering him up to the
 Rajah.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I suppose I must have been stupid with fatigue, or perhaps I did doze
 off for a time," he said. The first thing he knew was his canoe coming to
 the bank. He became instantaneously aware of the forest having been left
 behind, of the first houses being visible higher up, of a stockade on his
 left, and of his boatmen leaping out together upon a low point of land and
 taking to their heels. Instinctively he leaped out after them. At first he
 thought himself deserted for some inconceivable reason, but he heard
 excited shouts, a gate swung open, and a lot of people poured out, making
 towards him. At the same time a boat full of armed men appeared on the
 river and came alongside his empty canoe, thus shutting off his retreat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I was too startled to be quite cool?don't you know? and if that
 revolver had been loaded I would have shot somebody?perhaps two,
 three bodies, and that would have been the end of me. But it wasn't. . .
 ." "Why not?" I asked. "Well, I couldn't fight the whole population, and I
 wasn't coming to them as if I were afraid of my life," he said, with just
 a faint hint of his stubborn sulkiness in the glance he gave me. I
 refrained from pointing out to him that they could not have known the
 chambers were actually empty. He had to satisfy himself in his own way. .
 . . "Anyhow it wasn't," he repeated good-humouredly, "and so I just stood
 still and asked them what was the matter. That seemed to strike them dumb.
 I saw some of these thieves going off with my box. That long-legged old
 scoundrel Kassim (I'll show him to you to-morrow) ran out fussing to me
 about the Rajah wanting to see me. I said, 'All right.' I too wanted to
 see the Rajah, and I simply walked in through the gate and?and?here
 I am." He laughed, and then with unexpected emphasis, "And do you know
 what's the best in it?" he asked. "I'll tell you. It's the knowledge that
 had I been wiped out it is this place that would have been the loser."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He spoke thus to me before his house on that evening I've mentioned?after
 we had watched the moon float away above the chasm between the hills like
 an ascending spirit out of a grave; its sheen descended, cold and pale,
 like the ghost of dead sunlight. There is something haunting in the light
 of the moon; it has all the dispassionateness of a disembodied soul, and
 something of its inconceivable mystery. It is to our sunshine, which?say
 what you like?is all we have to live by, what the echo is to the
 sound: misleading and confusing whether the note be mocking or sad. It
 robs all forms of matter?which, after all, is our domain?of
 their substance, and gives a sinister reality to shadows alone. And the
 shadows were very real around us, but Jim by my side looked very stalwart,
 as though nothing?not even the occult power of moonlight?could
 rob him of his reality in my eyes. Perhaps, indeed, nothing could touch
 him since he had survived the assault of the dark powers. All was silent,
 all was still; even on the river the moonbeams slept as on a pool. It was
 the moment of high water, a moment of immobility that accentuated the
 utter isolation of this lost corner of the earth. The houses crowding
 along the wide shining sweep without ripple or glitter, stepping into the
 water in a line of jostling, vague, grey, silvery forms mingled with black
 masses of shadow, were like a spectral herd of shapeless creatures
 pressing forward to drink in a spectral and lifeless stream. Here and
 there a red gleam twinkled within the bamboo walls, warm, like a living
 spark, significant of human affections, of shelter, of repose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He confessed to me that he often watched these tiny warm gleams go out
 one by one, that he loved to see people go to sleep under his eyes,
 confident in the security of to-morrow. "Peaceful here, eh?" he asked. He
 was not eloquent, but there was a deep meaning in the words that followed.
 "Look at these houses; there's not one where I am not trusted. Jove! I
 told you I would hang on. Ask any man, woman, or child . . ." He paused.
 "Well, I am all right anyhow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I observed quickly that he had found that out in the end. I had been sure
 of it, I added. He shook his head. "Were you?" He pressed my arm lightly
 above the elbow. "Well, then?you were right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There was elation and pride, there was awe almost, in that low
 exclamation. "Jove!" he cried, "only think what it is to me." Again he
 pressed my arm. "And you asked me whether I thought of leaving. Good God!
 I! want to leave! Especially now after what you told me of Mr. Stein's . .
 . Leave! Why! That's what I was afraid of. It would have been?it
 would have been harder than dying. No?on my word. Don't laugh. I
 must feel?every day, every time I open my eyes?that I am
 trusted?that nobody has a right?don't you know? Leave! For
 where? What for? To get what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I had told him (indeed it was the main object of my visit) that it was
 Stein's intention to present him at once with the house and the stock of
 trading goods, on certain easy conditions which would make the transaction
 perfectly regular and valid. He began to snort and plunge at first.
 "Confound your delicacy!" I shouted. "It isn't Stein at all. It's giving
 you what you had made for yourself. And in any case keep your remarks for
 McNeil?when you meet him in the other world. I hope it won't happen
 soon. . . ." He had to give in to my arguments, because all his conquests,
 the trust, the fame, the friendships, the love?all these things that
 made him master had made him a captive, too. He looked with an owner's eye
 at the peace of the evening, at the river, at the houses, at the
 everlasting life of the forests, at the life of the old mankind, at the
 secrets of the land, at the pride of his own heart; but it was they that
 possessed him and made him their own to the innermost thought, to the
 slightest stir of blood, to his last breath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was something to be proud of. I, too, was proud?for him, if not
 so certain of the fabulous value of the bargain. It was wonderful. It was
 not so much of his fearlessness that I thought. It is strange how little
 account I took of it: as if it had been something too conventional to be
 at the root of the matter. No. I was more struck by the other gifts he had
 displayed. He had proved his grasp of the unfamiliar situation, his
 intellectual alertness in that field of thought. There was his readiness,
 too! Amazing. And all this had come to him in a manner like keen scent to
 a well-bred hound. He was not eloquent, but there was a dignity in this
 constitutional reticence, there was a high seriousness in his stammerings.
 He had still his old trick of stubborn blushing. Now and then, though, a
 word, a sentence, would escape him that showed how deeply, how solemnly,
 he felt about that work which had given him the certitude of
 rehabilitation. That is why he seemed to love the land and the people with
 a sort of fierce egoism, with a contemptuous tenderness.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 25
 </h2>
 <p>
 '"This is where I was prisoner for three days," he murmured to me (it was
 on the occasion of our visit to the Rajah), while we were making our way
 slowly through a kind of awestruck riot of dependants across Tunku
 Allang's courtyard. "Filthy place, isn't it? And I couldn't get anything
 to eat either, unless I made a row about it, and then it was only a small
 plate of rice and a fried fish not much bigger than a stickleback?confound
 them! Jove! I've been hungry prowling inside this stinking enclosure with
 some of these vagabonds shoving their mugs right under my nose. I had
 given up that famous revolver of yours at the first demand. Glad to get
 rid of the bally thing. Look like a fool walking about with an empty
 shooting-iron in my hand." At that moment we came into the presence, and
 he became unflinchingly grave and complimentary with his late captor. Oh!
 magnificent! I want to laugh when I think of it. But I was impressed, too.
 The old disreputable Tunku Allang could not help showing his fear (he was
 no hero, for all the tales of his hot youth he was fond of telling); and
 at the same time there was a wistful confidence in his manner towards his
 late prisoner. Note! Even where he would be most hated he was still
 trusted. Jim?as far as I could follow the conversation?was
 improving the occasion by the delivery of a lecture. Some poor villagers
 had been waylaid and robbed while on their way to Doramin's house with a
 few pieces of gum or beeswax which they wished to exchange for rice. "It
 was Doramin who was a thief," burst out the Rajah. A shaking fury seemed
 to enter that old frail body. He writhed weirdly on his mat, gesticulating
 with his hands and feet, tossing the tangled strings of his mop?an
 impotent incarnation of rage. There were staring eyes and dropping jaws
 all around us. Jim began to speak. Resolutely, coolly, and for some time
 he enlarged upon the text that no man should be prevented from getting his
 food and his children's food honestly. The other sat like a tailor at his
 board, one palm on each knee, his head low, and fixing Jim through the
 grey hair that fell over his very eyes. When Jim had done there was a
 great stillness. Nobody seemed to breathe even; no one made a sound till
 the old Rajah sighed faintly, and looking up, with a toss of his head,
 said quickly, "You hear, my people! No more of these little games." This
 decree was received in profound silence. A rather heavy man, evidently in
 a position of confidence, with intelligent eyes, a bony, broad, very dark
 face, and a cheerily of officious manner (I learned later on he was the
 executioner), presented to us two cups of coffee on a brass tray, which he
 took from the hands of an inferior attendant. "You needn't drink,"
 muttered Jim very rapidly. I didn't perceive the meaning at first, and
 only looked at him. He took a good sip and sat composedly, holding the
 saucer in his left hand. In a moment I felt excessively annoyed. "Why the
 devil," I whispered, smiling at him amiably, "do you expose me to such a
 stupid risk?" I drank, of course, there was nothing for it, while he gave
 no sign, and almost immediately afterwards we took our leave. While we
 were going down the courtyard to our boat, escorted by the intelligent and
 cheery executioner, Jim said he was very sorry. It was the barest chance,
 of course. Personally he thought nothing of poison. The remotest chance.
 He was?he assured me?considered to be infinitely more useful
 than dangerous, and so . . . "But the Rajah is afraid of you abominably.
 Anybody can see that," I argued with, I own, a certain peevishness, and
 all the time watching anxiously for the first twist of some sort of
 ghastly colic. I was awfully disgusted. "If I am to do any good here and
 preserve my position," he said, taking his seat by my side in the boat, "I
 must stand the risk: I take it once every month, at least. Many people
 trust me to do that?for them. Afraid of me! That's just it. Most
 likely he is afraid of me because I am not afraid of his coffee." Then
 showing me a place on the north front of the stockade where the pointed
 tops of several stakes were broken, "This is where I leaped over on my
 third day in Patusan. They haven't put new stakes there yet. Good leap,
 eh?" A moment later we passed the mouth of a muddy creek. "This is my
 second leap. I had a bit of a run and took this one flying, but fell
 short. Thought I would leave my skin there. Lost my shoes struggling. And
 all the time I was thinking to myself how beastly it would be to get a jab
 with a bally long spear while sticking in the mud like this. I remember
 how sick I felt wriggling in that slime. I mean really sick?as if I
 had bitten something rotten."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'That's how it was?and the opportunity ran by his side, leaped over
 the gap, floundered in the mud . . . still veiled. The unexpectedness of
 his coming was the only thing, you understand, that saved him from being
 at once dispatched with krisses and flung into the river. They had him,
 but it was like getting hold of an apparition, a wraith, a portent. What
 did it mean? What to do with it? Was it too late to conciliate him? Hadn't
 he better be killed without more delay? But what would happen then?
 Wretched old Allang went nearly mad with apprehension and through the
 difficulty of making up his mind. Several times the council was broken up,
 and the advisers made a break helter-skelter for the door and out on to
 the verandah. One?it is said?even jumped down to the ground?fifteen
 feet, I should judge?and broke his leg. The royal governor of
 Patusan had bizarre mannerisms, and one of them was to introduce boastful
 rhapsodies into every arduous discussion, when, getting gradually excited,
 he would end by flying off his perch with a kriss in his hand. But,
 barring such interruptions, the deliberations upon Jim's fate went on
 night and day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Meanwhile he wandered about the courtyard, shunned by some, glared at by
 others, but watched by all, and practically at the mercy of the first
 casual ragamuffin with a chopper, in there. He took possession of a small
 tumble-down shed to sleep in; the effluvia of filth and rotten matter
 incommoded him greatly: it seems he had not lost his appetite though,
 because?he told me?he had been hungry all the blessed time.
 Now and again "some fussy ass" deputed from the council-room would come
 out running to him, and in honeyed tones would administer amazing
 interrogatories: "Were the Dutch coming to take the country? Would the
 white man like to go back down the river? What was the object of coming to
 such a miserable country? The Rajah wanted to know whether the white man
 could repair a watch?" They did actually bring out to him a nickel clock
 of New England make, and out of sheer unbearable boredom he busied himself
 in trying to get the alarum to work. It was apparently when thus occupied
 in his shed that the true perception of his extreme peril dawned upon him.
 He dropped the thing?he says?"like a hot potato," and walked
 out hastily, without the slightest idea of what he would, or indeed could,
 do. He only knew that the position was intolerable. He strolled aimlessly
 beyond a sort of ramshackle little granary on posts, and his eyes fell on
 the broken stakes of the palisade; and then?he says?at once,
 without any mental process as it were, without any stir of emotion, he set
 about his escape as if executing a plan matured for a month. He walked off
 carelessly to give himself a good run, and when he faced about there was
 some dignitary, with two spearmen in attendance, close at his elbow ready
 with a question. He started off "from under his very nose," went over
 "like a bird," and landed on the other side with a fall that jarred all
 his bones and seemed to split his head. He picked himself up instantly. He
 never thought of anything at the time; all he could remember?he said?was
 a great yell; the first houses of Patusan were before him four hundred
 yards away; he saw the creek, and as it were mechanically put on more
 pace. The earth seemed fairly to fly backwards under his feet. He took off
 from the last dry spot, felt himself flying through the air, felt himself,
 without any shock, planted upright in an extremely soft and sticky
 mudbank. It was only when he tried to move his legs and found he couldn't
 that, in his own words, "he came to himself." He began to think of the
 "bally long spears." As a matter of fact, considering that the people
 inside the stockade had to run to the gate, then get down to the
 landing-place, get into boats, and pull round a point of land, he had more
 advance than he imagined. Besides, it being low water, the creek was
 without water?you couldn't call it dry?and practically he was
 safe for a time from everything but a very long shot perhaps. The higher
 firm ground was about six feet in front of him. "I thought I would have to
 die there all the same," he said. He reached and grabbed desperately with
 his hands, and only succeeded in gathering a horrible cold shiny heap of
 slime against his breast?up to his very chin. It seemed to him he
 was burying himself alive, and then he struck out madly, scattering the
 mud with his fists. It fell on his head, on his face, over his eyes, into
 his mouth. He told me that he remembered suddenly the courtyard, as you
 remember a place where you had been very happy years ago. He longed?so
 he said?to be back there again, mending the clock. Mending the clock?that
 was the idea. He made efforts, tremendous sobbing, gasping efforts,
 efforts that seemed to burst his eyeballs in their sockets and make him
 blind, and culminating into one mighty supreme effort in the darkness to
 crack the earth asunder, to throw it off his limbs?and he felt
 himself creeping feebly up the bank. He lay full length on the firm ground
 and saw the light, the sky. Then as a sort of happy thought the notion
 came to him that he would go to sleep. He will have it that he <i>did</i>
 actually go to sleep; that he slept?perhaps for a minute, perhaps
 for twenty seconds, or only for one second, but he recollects distinctly
 the violent convulsive start of awakening. He remained lying still for a
 while, and then he arose muddy from head to foot and stood there, thinking
 he was alone of his kind for hundreds of miles, alone, with no help, no
 sympathy, no pity to expect from any one, like a hunted animal. The first
 houses were not more than twenty yards from him; and it was the desperate
 screaming of a frightened woman trying to carry off a child that started
 him again. He pelted straight on in his socks, beplastered with filth out
 of all semblance to a human being. He traversed more than half the length
 of the settlement. The nimbler women fled right and left, the slower men
 just dropped whatever they had in their hands, and remained petrified with
 dropping jaws. He was a flying terror. He says he noticed the little
 children trying to run for life, falling on their little stomachs and
 kicking. He swerved between two houses up a slope, clambered in
 desperation over a barricade of felled trees (there wasn't a week without
 some fight in Patusan at that time), burst through a fence into a
 maize-patch, where a scared boy flung a stick at him, blundered upon a
 path, and ran all at once into the arms of several startled men. He just
 had breath enough to gasp out, "Doramin! Doramin!" He remembers being
 half-carried, half-rushed to the top of the slope, and in a vast enclosure
 with palms and fruit trees being run up to a large man sitting massively
 in a chair in the midst of the greatest possible commotion and excitement.
 He fumbled in mud and clothes to produce the ring, and, finding himself
 suddenly on his back, wondered who had knocked him down. They had simply
 let him go?don't you know??but he couldn't stand. At the foot
 of the slope random shots were fired, and above the roofs of the
 settlement there rose a dull roar of amazement. But he was safe. Doramin's
 people were barricading the gate and pouring water down his throat;
 Doramin's old wife, full of business and commiseration, was issuing shrill
 orders to her girls. "The old woman," he said softly, "made a to-do over
 me as if I had been her own son. They put me into an immense bed?her
 state bed?and she ran in and out wiping her eyes to give me pats on
 the back. I must have been a pitiful object. I just lay there like a log
 for I don't know how long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He seemed to have a great liking for Doramin's old wife. She on her side
 had taken a motherly fancy to him. She had a round, nut-brown, soft face,
 all fine wrinkles, large, bright red lips (she chewed betel assiduously),
 and screwed up, winking, benevolent eyes. She was constantly in movement,
 scolding busily and ordering unceasingly a troop of young women with clear
 brown faces and big grave eyes, her daughters, her servants, her
 slave-girls. You know how it is in these households: it's generally
 impossible to tell the difference. She was very spare, and even her ample
 outer garment, fastened in front with jewelled clasps, had somehow a
 skimpy effect. Her dark bare feet were thrust into yellow straw slippers
 of Chinese make. I have seen her myself flitting about with her extremely
 thick, long, grey hair falling about her shoulders. She uttered homely
 shrewd sayings, was of noble birth, and was eccentric and arbitrary. In
 the afternoon she would sit in a very roomy arm-chair, opposite her
 husband, gazing steadily through a wide opening in the wall which gave an
 extensive view of the settlement and the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She invariably tucked up her feet under her, but old Doramin sat
 squarely, sat imposingly as a mountain sits on a plain. He was only of the
 nakhoda or merchant class, but the respect shown to him and the dignity of
 his bearing were very striking. He was the chief of the second power in
 Patusan. The immigrants from Celebes (about sixty families that, with
 dependants and so on, could muster some two hundred men "wearing the
 kriss") had elected him years ago for their head. The men of that race are
 intelligent, enterprising, revengeful, but with a more frank courage than
 the other Malays, and restless under oppression. They formed the party
 opposed to the Rajah. Of course the quarrels were for trade. This was the
 primary cause of faction fights, of the sudden outbreaks that would fill
 this or that part of the settlement with smoke, flame, the noise of shots
 and shrieks. Villages were burnt, men were dragged into the Rajah's
 stockade to be killed or tortured for the crime of trading with anybody
 else but himself. Only a day or two before Jim's arrival several heads of
 households in the very fishing village that was afterwards taken under his
 especial protection had been driven over the cliffs by a party of the
 Rajah's spearmen, on suspicion of having been collecting edible birds'
 nests for a Celebes trader. Rajah Allang pretended to be the only trader
 in his country, and the penalty for the breach of the monopoly was death;
 but his idea of trading was indistinguishable from the commonest forms of
 robbery. His cruelty and rapacity had no other bounds than his cowardice,
 and he was afraid of the organised power of the Celebes men, only?till
 Jim came?he was not afraid enough to keep quiet. He struck at them
 through his subjects, and thought himself pathetically in the right. The
 situation was complicated by a wandering stranger, an Arab half-breed,
 who, I believe, on purely religious grounds, had incited the tribes in the
 interior (the bush-folk, as Jim himself called them) to rise, and had
 established himself in a fortified camp on the summit of one of the twin
 hills. He hung over the town of Patusan like a hawk over a poultry-yard,
 but he devastated the open country. Whole villages, deserted, rotted on
 their blackened posts over the banks of clear streams, dropping piecemeal
 into the water the grass of their walls, the leaves of their roofs, with a
 curious effect of natural decay as if they had been a form of vegetation
 stricken by a blight at its very root. The two parties in Patusan were not
 sure which one this partisan most desired to plunder. The Rajah intrigued
 with him feebly. Some of the Bugis settlers, weary with endless
 insecurity, were half inclined to call him in. The younger spirits amongst
 them, chaffing, advised to "get Sherif Ali with his wild men and drive the
 Rajah Allang out of the country." Doramin restrained them with difficulty.
 He was growing old, and, though his influence had not diminished, the
 situation was getting beyond him. This was the state of affairs when Jim,
 bolting from the Rajah's stockade, appeared before the chief of the Bugis,
 produced the ring, and was received, in a manner of speaking, into the
 heart of the community.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 26
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Doramin was one of the most remarkable men of his race I had ever seen.
 His bulk for a Malay was immense, but he did not look merely fat; he
 looked imposing, monumental. This motionless body, clad in rich stuffs,
 coloured silks, gold embroideries; this huge head, enfolded in a
 red-and-gold headkerchief; the flat, big, round face, wrinkled, furrowed,
 with two semicircular heavy folds starting on each side of wide, fierce
 nostrils, and enclosing a thick-lipped mouth; the throat like a bull; the
 vast corrugated brow overhanging the staring proud eyes?made a whole
 that, once seen, can never be forgotten. His impassive repose (he seldom
 stirred a limb when once he sat down) was like a display of dignity. He
 was never known to raise his voice. It was a hoarse and powerful murmur,
 slightly veiled as if heard from a distance. When he walked, two short,
 sturdy young fellows, naked to the waist, in white sarongs and with black
 skull-caps on the backs of their heads, sustained his elbows; they would
 ease him down and stand behind his chair till he wanted to rise, when he
 would turn his head slowly, as if with difficulty, to the right and to the
 left, and then they would catch him under his armpits and help him up. For
 all that, there was nothing of a cripple about him: on the contrary, all
 his ponderous movements were like manifestations of a mighty deliberate
 force. It was generally believed he consulted his wife as to public
 affairs; but nobody, as far as I know, had ever heard them exchange a
 single word. When they sat in state by the wide opening it was in silence.
 They could see below them in the declining light the vast expanse of the
 forest country, a dark sleeping sea of sombre green undulating as far as
 the violet and purple range of mountains; the shining sinuosity of the
 river like an immense letter S of beaten silver; the brown ribbon of
 houses following the sweep of both banks, overtopped by the twin hills
 uprising above the nearer tree-tops. They were wonderfully contrasted:
 she, light, delicate, spare, quick, a little witch-like, with a touch of
 motherly fussiness in her repose; he, facing her, immense and heavy, like
 a figure of a man roughly fashioned of stone, with something magnanimous
 and ruthless in his immobility. The son of these old people was a most
 distinguished youth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'They had him late in life. Perhaps he was not really so young as he
 looked. Four- or five-and-twenty is not so young when a man is already
 father of a family at eighteen. When he entered the large room, lined and
 carpeted with fine mats, and with a high ceiling of white sheeting, where
 the couple sat in state surrounded by a most deferential retinue, he would
 make his way straight to Doramin, to kiss his hand?which the other
 abandoned to him, majestically?and then would step across to stand
 by his mother's chair. I suppose I may say they idolised him, but I never
 caught them giving him an overt glance. Those, it is true, were public
 functions. The room was generally thronged. The solemn formality of
 greetings and leave-takings, the profound respect expressed in gestures,
 on the faces, in the low whispers, is simply indescribable. "It's well
 worth seeing," Jim had assured me while we were crossing the river, on our
 way back. "They are like people in a book, aren't they?" he said
 triumphantly. "And Dain Waris?their son?is the best friend
 (barring you) I ever had. What Mr. Stein would call a good 'war-comrade.'
 I was in luck. Jove! I was in luck when I tumbled amongst them at my last
 gasp." He meditated with bowed head, then rousing himself he added?'"Of
 course I didn't go to sleep over it, but . . ." He paused again. "It
 seemed to come to me," he murmured. "All at once I saw what I had to do .
 . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There was no doubt that it had come to him; and it had come through war,
 too, as is natural, since this power that came to him was the power to
 make peace. It is in this sense alone that might so often is right. You
 must not think he had seen his way at once. When he arrived the Bugis
 community was in a most critical position. "They were all afraid," he said
 to me?"each man afraid for himself; while I could see as plain as
 possible that they must do something at once, if they did not want to go
 under one after another, what between the Rajah and that vagabond Sherif."
 But to see that was nothing. When he got his idea he had to drive it into
 reluctant minds, through the bulwarks of fear, of selfishness. He drove it
 in at last. And that was nothing. He had to devise the means. He devised
 them?an audacious plan; and his task was only half done. He had to
 inspire with his own confidence a lot of people who had hidden and absurd
 reasons to hang back; he had to conciliate imbecile jealousies, and argue
 away all sorts of senseless mistrusts. Without the weight of Doramin's
 authority, and his son's fiery enthusiasm, he would have failed. Dain
 Waris, the distinguished youth, was the first to believe in him; theirs
 was one of those strange, profound, rare friendships between brown and
 white, in which the very difference of race seems to draw two human beings
 closer by some mystic element of sympathy. Of Dain Waris, his own people
 said with pride that he knew how to fight like a white man. This was true;
 he had that sort of courage?the courage in the open, I may say?but
 he had also a European mind. You meet them sometimes like that, and are
 surprised to discover unexpectedly a familiar turn of thought, an
 unobscured vision, a tenacity of purpose, a touch of altruism. Of small
 stature, but admirably well proportioned, Dain Waris had a proud carriage,
 a polished, easy bearing, a temperament like a clear flame. His dusky
 face, with big black eyes, was in action expressive, and in repose
 thoughtful. He was of a silent disposition; a firm glance, an ironic
 smile, a courteous deliberation of manner seemed to hint at great reserves
 of intelligence and power. Such beings open to the Western eye, so often
 concerned with mere surfaces, the hidden possibilities of races and lands
 over which hangs the mystery of unrecorded ages. He not only trusted Jim,
 he understood him, I firmly believe. I speak of him because he had
 captivated me. His?if I may say so?his caustic placidity, and,
 at the same time, his intelligent sympathy with Jim's aspirations,
 appealed to me. I seemed to behold the very origin of friendship. If Jim
 took the lead, the other had captivated his leader. In fact, Jim the
 leader was a captive in every sense. The land, the people, the friendship,
 the love, were like the jealous guardians of his body. Every day added a
 link to the fetters of that strange freedom. I felt convinced of it, as
 from day to day I learned more of the story.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The story! Haven't I heard the story? I've heard it on the march, in camp
 (he made me scour the country after invisible game); I've listened to a
 good part of it on one of the twin summits, after climbing the last
 hundred feet or so on my hands and knees. Our escort (we had volunteer
 followers from village to village) had camped meantime on a bit of level
 ground half-way up the slope, and in the still breathless evening the
 smell of wood-smoke reached our nostrils from below with the penetrating
 delicacy of some choice scent. Voices also ascended, wonderful in their
 distinct and immaterial clearness. Jim sat on the trunk of a felled tree,
 and pulling out his pipe began to smoke. A new growth of grass and bushes
 was springing up; there were traces of an earthwork under a mass of thorny
 twigs. "It all started from here," he said, after a long and meditative
 silence. On the other hill, two hundred yards across a sombre precipice, I
 saw a line of high blackened stakes, showing here and there ruinously?the
 remnants of Sherif Ali's impregnable camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But it had been taken, though. That had been his idea. He had mounted
 Doramin's old ordnance on the top of that hill; two rusty iron 7-pounders,
 a lot of small brass cannon?currency cannon. But if the brass guns
 represent wealth, they can also, when crammed recklessly to the muzzle,
 send a solid shot to some little distance. The thing was to get them up
 there. He showed me where he had fastened the cables, explained how he had
 improvised a rude capstan out of a hollowed log turning upon a pointed
 stake, indicated with the bowl of his pipe the outline of the earthwork.
 The last hundred feet of the ascent had been the most difficult. He had
 made himself responsible for success on his own head. He had induced the
 war party to work hard all night. Big fires lighted at intervals blazed
 all down the slope, "but up here," he explained, "the hoisting gang had to
 fly around in the dark." From the top he saw men moving on the hillside
 like ants at work. He himself on that night had kept on rushing down and
 climbing up like a squirrel, directing, encouraging, watching all along
 the line. Old Doramin had himself carried up the hill in his arm-chair.
 They put him down on the level place upon the slope, and he sat there in
 the light of one of the big fires?"amazing old chap?real old
 chieftain," said Jim, "with his little fierce eyes?a pair of immense
 flintlock pistols on his knees. Magnificent things, ebony, silver-mounted,
 with beautiful locks and a calibre like an old blunderbuss. A present from
 Stein, it seems?in exchange for that ring, you know. Used to belong
 to good old McNeil. God only knows how <i>he</i> came by them. There he
 sat, moving neither hand nor foot, a flame of dry brushwood behind him,
 and lots of people rushing about, shouting and pulling round him?the
 most solemn, imposing old chap you can imagine. He wouldn't have had much
 chance if Sherif Ali had let his infernal crew loose at us and stampeded
 my lot. Eh? Anyhow, he had come up there to die if anything went wrong. No
 mistake! Jove! It thrilled me to see him there?like a rock. But the
 Sherif must have thought us mad, and never troubled to come and see how we
 got on. Nobody believed it could be done. Why! I think the very chaps who
 pulled and shoved and sweated over it did not believe it could be done!
 Upon my word I don't think they did. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He stood erect, the smouldering brier-wood in his clutch, with a smile on
 his lips and a sparkle in his boyish eyes. I sat on the stump of a tree at
 his feet, and below us stretched the land, the great expanse of the
 forests, sombre under the sunshine, rolling like a sea, with glints of
 winding rivers, the grey spots of villages, and here and there a clearing,
 like an islet of light amongst the dark waves of continuous tree-tops. A
 brooding gloom lay over this vast and monotonous landscape; the light fell
 on it as if into an abyss. The land devoured the sunshine; only far off,
 along the coast, the empty ocean, smooth and polished within the faint
 haze, seemed to rise up to the sky in a wall of steel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And there I was with him, high in the sunshine on the top of that
 historic hill of his. He dominated the forest, the secular gloom, the old
 mankind. He was like a figure set up on a pedestal, to represent in his
 persistent youth the power, and perhaps the virtues, of races that never
 grow old, that have emerged from the gloom. I don't know why he should
 always have appeared to me symbolic. Perhaps this is the real cause of my
 interest in his fate. I don't know whether it was exactly fair to him to
 remember the incident which had given a new direction to his life, but at
 that very moment I remembered very distinctly. It was like a shadow in the
 light.'

 CHAPTER 27
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Already the legend had gifted him with supernatural powers. Yes, it was
 said, there had been many ropes cunningly disposed, and a strange
 contrivance that turned by the efforts of many men, and each gun went up
 tearing slowly through the bushes, like a wild pig rooting its way in the
 undergrowth, but . . . and the wisest shook their heads. There was
 something occult in all this, no doubt; for what is the strength of ropes
 and of men's arms? There is a rebellious soul in things which must be
 overcome by powerful charms and incantations. Thus old Sura?a very
 respectable householder of Patusan?with whom I had a quiet chat one
 evening. However, Sura was a professional sorcerer also, who attended all
 the rice sowings and reapings for miles around for the purpose of subduing
 the stubborn souls of things. This occupation he seemed to think a most
 arduous one, and perhaps the souls of things are more stubborn than the
 souls of men. As to the simple folk of outlying villages, they believed
 and said (as the most natural thing in the world) that Jim had carried the
 guns up the hill on his back?two at a time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This would make Jim stamp his foot in vexation and exclaim with an
 exasperated little laugh, "What can you do with such silly beggars? They
 will sit up half the night talking bally rot, and the greater the lie the
 more they seem to like it." You could trace the subtle influence of his
 surroundings in this irritation. It was part of his captivity. The
 earnestness of his denials was amusing, and at last I said, "My dear
 fellow, you don't suppose <i>I</i> believe this." He looked at me quite
 startled. "Well, no! I suppose not," he said, and burst into a Homeric
 peal of laughter. "Well, anyhow the guns were there, and went off all
 together at sunrise. Jove! You should have seen the splinters fly," he
 cried. By his side Dain Waris, listening with a quiet smile, dropped his
 eyelids and shuffled his feet a little. It appears that the success in
 mounting the guns had given Jim's people such a feeling of confidence that
 he ventured to leave the battery under charge of two elderly Bugis who had
 seen some fighting in their day, and went to join Dain Waris and the
 storming party who were concealed in the ravine. In the small hours they
 began creeping up, and when two-thirds of the way up, lay in the wet grass
 waiting for the appearance of the sun, which was the agreed signal. He
 told me with what impatient anguishing emotion he watched the swift coming
 of the dawn; how, heated with the work and the climbing, he felt the cold
 dew chilling his very bones; how afraid he was he would begin to shiver
 and shake like a leaf before the time came for the advance. "It was the
 slowest half-hour in my life," he declared. Gradually the silent stockade
 came out on the sky above him. Men scattered all down the slope were
 crouching amongst the dark stones and dripping bushes. Dain Waris was
 lying flattened by his side. "We looked at each other," Jim said, resting
 a gentle hand on his friend's shoulder. "He smiled at me as cheery as you
 please, and I dared not stir my lips for fear I would break out into a
 shivering fit. 'Pon my word, it's true! I had been streaming with
 perspiration when we took cover?so you may imagine . . ." He
 declared, and I believe him, that he had no fears as to the result. He was
 only anxious as to his ability to repress these shivers. He didn't bother
 about the result. He was bound to get to the top of that hill and stay
 there, whatever might happen. There could be no going back for him. Those
 people had trusted him implicitly. Him alone! His bare word. . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I remember how, at this point, he paused with his eyes fixed upon me. "As
 far as he knew, they never had an occasion to regret it yet," he said.
 "Never. He hoped to God they never would. Meantime?worse luck!?they
 had got into the habit of taking his word for anything and everything. I
 could have no idea! Why, only the other day an old fool he had never seen
 in his life came from some village miles away to find out if he should
 divorce his wife. Fact. Solemn word. That's the sort of thing. . . He
 wouldn't have believed it. Would I? Squatted on the verandah chewing
 betel-nut, sighing and spitting all over the place for more than an hour,
 and as glum as an undertaker before he came out with that dashed
 conundrum. That's the kind of thing that isn't so funny as it looks. What
 was a fellow to say??Good wife??Yes. Good wife?old
 though. Started a confounded long story about some brass pots. Been living
 together for fifteen years?twenty years?could not tell. A
 long, long time. Good wife. Beat her a little?not much?just a
 little, when she was young. Had to?for the sake of his honour.
 Suddenly in her old age she goes and lends three brass pots to her
 sister's son's wife, and begins to abuse him every day in a loud voice.
 His enemies jeered at him; his face was utterly blackened. Pots totally
 lost. Awfully cut up about it. Impossible to fathom a story like that;
 told him to go home, and promised to come along myself and settle it all.
 It's all very well to grin, but it was the dashedest nuisance! A day's
 journey through the forest, another day lost in coaxing a lot of silly
 villagers to get at the rights of the affair. There was the making of a
 sanguinary shindy in the thing. Every bally idiot took sides with one
 family or the other, and one half of the village was ready to go for the
 other half with anything that came handy. Honour bright! No joke! . . .
 Instead of attending to their bally crops. Got him the infernal pots back
 of course?and pacified all hands. No trouble to settle it. Of course
 not. Could settle the deadliest quarrel in the country by crooking his
 little finger. The trouble was to get at the truth of anything. Was not
 sure to this day whether he had been fair to all parties. It worried him.
 And the talk! Jove! There didn't seem to be any head or tail to it. Rather
 storm a twenty-foot-high old stockade any day. Much! Child's play to that
 other job. Wouldn't take so long either. Well, yes; a funny set out, upon
 the whole?the fool looked old enough to be his grandfather. But from
 another point of view it was no joke. His word decided everything?ever
 since the smashing of Sherif Ali. An awful responsibility," he repeated.
 "No, really?joking apart, had it been three lives instead of three
 rotten brass pots it would have been the same. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus he illustrated the moral effect of his victory in war. It was in
 truth immense. It had led him from strife to peace, and through death into
 the innermost life of the people; but the gloom of the land spread out
 under the sunshine preserved its appearance of inscrutable, of secular
 repose. The sound of his fresh young voice?it's extraordinary how
 very few signs of wear he showed?floated lightly, and passed away
 over the unchanged face of the forests like the sound of the big guns on
 that cold dewy morning when he had no other concern on earth but the
 proper control of the chills in his body. With the first slant of sun-rays
 along these immovable tree-tops the summit of one hill wreathed itself,
 with heavy reports, in white clouds of smoke, and the other burst into an
 amazing noise of yells, war-cries, shouts of anger, of surprise, of
 dismay. Jim and Dain Waris were the first to lay their hands on the
 stakes. The popular story has it that Jim with a touch of one finger had
 thrown down the gate. He was, of course, anxious to disclaim this
 achievement. The whole stockade?he would insist on explaining to you?was
 a poor affair (Sherif Ali trusted mainly to the inaccessible position);
 and, anyway, the thing had been already knocked to pieces and only hung
 together by a miracle. He put his shoulder to it like a little fool and
 went in head over heels. Jove! If it hadn't been for Dain Waris, a
 pock-marked tattooed vagabond would have pinned him with his spear to a
 baulk of timber like one of Stein's beetles. The third man in, it seems,
 had been Tamb' Itam, Jim's own servant. This was a Malay from the north, a
 stranger who had wandered into Patusan, and had been forcibly detained by
 Rajah Allang as paddler of one of the state boats. He had made a bolt of
 it at the first opportunity, and finding a precarious refuge (but very
 little to eat) amongst the Bugis settlers, had attached himself to Jim's
 person. His complexion was very dark, his face flat, his eyes prominent
 and injected with bile. There was something excessive, almost fanatical,
 in his devotion to his "white lord." He was inseparable from Jim like a
 morose shadow. On state occasions he would tread on his master's heels,
 one hand on the haft of his kriss, keeping the common people at a distance
 by his truculent brooding glances. Jim had made him the headman of his
 establishment, and all Patusan respected and courted him as a person of
 much influence. At the taking of the stockade he had distinguished himself
 greatly by the methodical ferocity of his fighting. The storming party had
 come on so quick?Jim said?that notwithstanding the panic of
 the garrison, there was a "hot five minutes hand-to-hand inside that
 stockade, till some bally ass set fire to the shelters of boughs and dry
 grass, and we all had to clear out for dear life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The rout, it seems, had been complete. Doramin, waiting immovably in his
 chair on the hillside, with the smoke of the guns spreading slowly above
 his big head, received the news with a deep grunt. When informed that his
 son was safe and leading the pursuit, he, without another sound, made a
 mighty effort to rise; his attendants hurried to his help, and, held up
 reverently, he shuffled with great dignity into a bit of shade, where he
 laid himself down to sleep, covered entirely with a piece of white
 sheeting. In Patusan the excitement was intense. Jim told me that from the
 hill, turning his back on the stockade with its embers, black ashes, and
 half-consumed corpses, he could see time after time the open spaces
 between the houses on both sides of the stream fill suddenly with a
 seething rush of people and get empty in a moment. His ears caught feebly
 from below the tremendous din of gongs and drums; the wild shouts of the
 crowd reached him in bursts of faint roaring. A lot of streamers made a
 flutter as of little white, red, yellow birds amongst the brown ridges of
 roofs. "You must have enjoyed it," I murmured, feeling the stir of
 sympathetic emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"It was . . . it was immense! Immense!" he cried aloud, flinging his arms
 open. The sudden movement startled me as though I had seen him bare the
 secrets of his breast to the sunshine, to the brooding forests, to the
 steely sea. Below us the town reposed in easy curves upon the banks of a
 stream whose current seemed to sleep. "Immense!" he repeated for a third
 time, speaking in a whisper, for himself alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Immense! No doubt it was immense; the seal of success upon his words, the
 conquered ground for the soles of his feet, the blind trust of men, the
 belief in himself snatched from the fire, the solitude of his achievement.
 All this, as I've warned you, gets dwarfed in the telling. I can't with
 mere words convey to you the impression of his total and utter isolation.
 I know, of course, he was in every sense alone of his kind there, but the
 unsuspected qualities of his nature had brought him in such close touch
 with his surroundings that this isolation seemed only the effect of his
 power. His loneliness added to his stature. There was nothing within sight
 to compare him with, as though he had been one of those exceptional men
 who can be only measured by the greatness of their fame; and his fame,
 remember, was the greatest thing around for many a day's journey. You
 would have to paddle, pole, or track a long weary way through the jungle
 before you passed beyond the reach of its voice. Its voice was not the
 trumpeting of the disreputable goddess we all know?not blatant?not
 brazen. It took its tone from the stillness and gloom of the land without
 a past, where his word was the one truth of every passing day. It shared
 something of the nature of that silence through which it accompanied you
 into unexplored depths, heard continuously by your side, penetrating,
 far-reaching?tinged with wonder and mystery on the lips of
 whispering men.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 28
 </h2>
 <p>
 'The defeated Sherif Ali fled the country without making another stand,
 and when the miserable hunted villagers began to crawl out of the jungle
 back to their rotting houses, it was Jim who, in consultation with Dain
 Waris, appointed the headmen. Thus he became the virtual ruler of the
 land. As to old Tunku Allang, his fears at first had known no bounds. It
 is said that at the intelligence of the successful storming of the hill he
 flung himself, face down, on the bamboo floor of his audience-hall, and
 lay motionless for a whole night and a whole day, uttering stifled sounds
 of such an appalling nature that no man dared approach his prostrate form
 nearer than a spear's length. Already he could see himself driven
 ignominiously out of Patusan, wandering abandoned, stripped, without
 opium, without his women, without followers, a fair game for the first
 comer to kill. After Sherif Ali his turn would come, and who could resist
 an attack led by such a devil? And indeed he owed his life and such
 authority as he still possessed at the time of my visit to Jim's idea of
 what was fair alone. The Bugis had been extremely anxious to pay off old
 scores, and the impassive old Doramin cherished the hope of yet seeing his
 son ruler of Patusan. During one of our interviews he deliberately allowed
 me to get a glimpse of this secret ambition. Nothing could be finer in its
 way than the dignified wariness of his approaches. He himself?he
 began by declaring?had used his strength in his young days, but now
 he had grown old and tired. . . . With his imposing bulk and haughty
 little eyes darting sagacious, inquisitive glances, he reminded one
 irresistibly of a cunning old elephant; the slow rise and fall of his vast
 breast went on powerful and regular, like the heave of a calm sea. He too,
 as he protested, had an unbounded confidence in Tuan Jim's wisdom. If he
 could only obtain a promise! One word would be enough! . . . His breathing
 silences, the low rumblings of his voice, recalled the last efforts of a
 spent thunderstorm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I tried to put the subject aside. It was difficult, for there could be no
 question that Jim had the power; in his new sphere there did not seem to
 be anything that was not his to hold or to give. But that, I repeat, was
 nothing in comparison with the notion, which occurred to me, while I
 listened with a show of attention, that he seemed to have come very near
 at last to mastering his fate. Doramin was anxious about the future of the
 country, and I was struck by the turn he gave to the argument. The land
 remains where God had put it; but white men?he said?they come
 to us and in a little while they go. They go away. Those they leave behind
 do not know when to look for their return. They go to their own land, to
 their people, and so this white man too would. . . . I don't know what
 induced me to commit myself at this point by a vigorous "No, no." The
 whole extent of this indiscretion became apparent when Doramin, turning
 full upon me his face, whose expression, fixed in rugged deep folds,
 remained unalterable, like a huge brown mask, said that this was good news
 indeed, reflectively; and then wanted to know why.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His little, motherly witch of a wife sat on my other hand, with her head
 covered and her feet tucked up, gazing through the great shutter-hole. I
 could only see a straying lock of grey hair, a high cheek-bone, the slight
 masticating motion of the sharp chin. Without removing her eyes from the
 vast prospect of forests stretching as far as the hills, she asked me in a
 pitying voice why was it that he so young had wandered from his home,
 coming so far, through so many dangers? Had he no household there, no
 kinsmen in his own country? Had he no old mother, who would always
 remember his face? . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was completely unprepared for this. I could only mutter and shake my
 head vaguely. Afterwards I am perfectly aware I cut a very poor figure
 trying to extricate myself out of this difficulty. From that moment,
 however, the old nakhoda became taciturn. He was not very pleased, I fear,
 and evidently I had given him food for thought. Strangely enough, on the
 evening of that very day (which was my last in Patusan) I was once more
 confronted with the same question, with the unanswerable why of Jim's
 fate. And this brings me to the story of his love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I suppose you think it is a story that you can imagine for yourselves. We
 have heard so many such stories, and the majority of us don't believe them
 to be stories of love at all. For the most part we look upon them as
 stories of opportunities: episodes of passion at best, or perhaps only of
 youth and temptation, doomed to forgetfulness in the end, even if they
 pass through the reality of tenderness and regret. This view mostly is
 right, and perhaps in this case too. . . . Yet I don't know. To tell this
 story is by no means so easy as it should be?were the ordinary
 standpoint adequate. Apparently it is a story very much like the others:
 for me, however, there is visible in its background the melancholy figure
 of a woman, the shadow of a cruel wisdom buried in a lonely grave, looking
 on wistfully, helplessly, with sealed lips. The grave itself, as I came
 upon it during an early morning stroll, was a rather shapeless brown
 mound, with an inlaid neat border of white lumps of coral at the base, and
 enclosed within a circular fence made of split saplings, with the bark
 left on. A garland of leaves and flowers was woven about the heads of the
 slender posts?and the flowers were fresh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus, whether the shadow is of my imagination or not, I can at all events
 point out the significant fact of an unforgotten grave. When I tell you
 besides that Jim with his own hands had worked at the rustic fence, you
 will perceive directly the difference, the individual side of the story.
 There is in his espousal of memory and affection belonging to another
 human being something characteristic of his seriousness. He had a
 conscience, and it was a romantic conscience. Through her whole life the
 wife of the unspeakable Cornelius had no other companion, confidant, and
 friend but her daughter. How the poor woman had come to marry the awful
 little Malacca Portuguese?after the separation from the father of
 her girl?and how that separation had been brought about, whether by
 death, which can be sometimes merciful, or by the merciless pressure of
 conventions, is a mystery to me. From the little which Stein (who knew so
 many stories) had let drop in my hearing, I am convinced that she was no
 ordinary woman. Her own father had been a white; a high official; one of
 the brilliantly endowed men who are not dull enough to nurse a success,
 and whose careers so often end under a cloud. I suppose she too must have
 lacked the saving dullness?and her career ended in Patusan. Our
 common fate . . . for where is the man?I mean a real sentient man?who
 does not remember vaguely having been deserted in the fullness of
 possession by some one or something more precious than life? . . . our
 common fate fastens upon the women with a peculiar cruelty. It does not
 punish like a master, but inflicts lingering torment, as if to gratify a
 secret, unappeasable spite. One would think that, appointed to rule on
 earth, it seeks to revenge itself upon the beings that come nearest to
 rising above the trammels of earthly caution; for it is only women who
 manage to put at times into their love an element just palpable enough to
 give one a fright?an extra-terrestrial touch. I ask myself with
 wonder?how the world can look to them?whether it has the shape
 and substance <i>we</i> know, the air <i>we</i> breathe! Sometimes I fancy
 it must be a region of unreasonable sublimities seething with the
 excitement of their adventurous souls, lighted by the glory of all
 possible risks and renunciations. However, I suspect there are very few
 women in the world, though of course I am aware of the multitudes of
 mankind and of the equality of sexes?in point of numbers, that is.
 But I am sure that the mother was as much of a woman as the daughter
 seemed to be. I cannot help picturing to myself these two, at first the
 young woman and the child, then the old woman and the young girl, the
 awful sameness and the swift passage of time, the barrier of forest, the
 solitude and the turmoil round these two lonely lives, and every word
 spoken between them penetrated with sad meaning. There must have been
 confidences, not so much of fact, I suppose, as of innermost feelings?regrets?fears?warnings,
 no doubt: warnings that the younger did not fully understand till the
 elder was dead?and Jim came along. Then I am sure she understood
 much?not everything?the fear mostly, it seems. Jim called her
 by a word that means precious, in the sense of a precious gem?jewel.
 Pretty, isn't it? But he was capable of anything. He was equal to his
 fortune, as he?after all?must have been equal to his
 misfortune. Jewel he called her; and he would say this as he might have
 said "Jane," don't you know?with a marital, homelike, peaceful
 effect. I heard the name for the first time ten minutes after I had landed
 in his courtyard, when, after nearly shaking my arm off, he darted up the
 steps and began to make a joyous, boyish disturbance at the door under the
 heavy eaves. "Jewel! O Jewel! Quick! Here's a friend come," . . . and
 suddenly peering at me in the dim verandah, he mumbled earnestly, "You
 know?this?no confounded nonsense about it?can't tell you
 how much I owe to her?and so?you understand?I?exactly
 as if . . ." His hurried, anxious whispers were cut short by the flitting
 of a white form within the house, a faint exclamation, and a child-like
 but energetic little face with delicate features and a profound, attentive
 glance peeped out of the inner gloom, like a bird out of the recess of a
 nest. I was struck by the name, of course; but it was not till later on
 that I connected it with an astonishing rumour that had met me on my
 journey, at a little place on the coast about 230 miles south of Patusan
 River. Stein's schooner, in which I had my passage, put in there, to
 collect some produce, and, going ashore, I found to my great surprise that
 the wretched locality could boast of a third-class deputy-assistant
 resident, a big, fat, greasy, blinking fellow of mixed descent, with
 turned-out, shiny lips. I found him lying extended on his back in a cane
 chair, odiously unbuttoned, with a large green leaf of some sort on the
 top of his steaming head, and another in his hand which he used lazily as
 a fan . . . Going to Patusan? Oh yes. Stein's Trading Company. He knew.
 Had a permission? No business of his. It was not so bad there now, he
 remarked negligently, and, he went on drawling, "There's some sort of
 white vagabond has got in there, I hear. . . . Eh? What you say? Friend of
 yours? So! . . . Then it was true there was one of these verdammte?What
 was he up to? Found his way in, the rascal. Eh? I had not been sure.
 Patusan?they cut throats there?no business of ours." He
 interrupted himself to groan. "Phoo! Almighty! The heat! The heat! Well,
 then, there might be something in the story too, after all, and . . ." He
 shut one of his beastly glassy eyes (the eyelid went on quivering) while
 he leered at me atrociously with the other. "Look here," says he
 mysteriously, "if?do you understand??if he has really got hold
 of something fairly good?none of your bits of green glass?understand??I
 am a Government official?you tell the rascal . . . Eh? What? Friend
 of yours?" . . . He continued wallowing calmly in the chair . . . "You
 said so; that's just it; and I am pleased to give you the hint. I suppose
 you too would like to get something out of it? Don't interrupt. You just
 tell him I've heard the tale, but to my Government I have made no report.
 Not yet. See? Why make a report? Eh? Tell him to come to me if they let
 him get alive out of the country. He had better look out for himself. Eh?
 I promise to ask no questions. On the quiet?you understand? You too?you
 shall get something from me. Small commission for the trouble. Don't
 interrupt. I am a Government official, and make no report. That's
 business. Understand? I know some good people that will buy anything worth
 having, and can give him more money than the scoundrel ever saw in his
 life. I know his sort." He fixed me steadfastly with both his eyes open,
 while I stood over him utterly amazed, and asking myself whether he was
 mad or drunk. He perspired, puffed, moaning feebly, and scratching himself
 with such horrible composure that I could not bear the sight long enough
 to find out. Next day, talking casually with the people of the little
 native court of the place, I discovered that a story was travelling slowly
 down the coast about a mysterious white man in Patusan who had got hold of
 an extraordinary gem?namely, an emerald of an enormous size, and
 altogether priceless. The emerald seems to appeal more to the Eastern
 imagination than any other precious stone. The white man had obtained it,
 I was told, partly by the exercise of his wonderful strength and partly by
 cunning, from the ruler of a distant country, whence he had fled
 instantly, arriving in Patusan in utmost distress, but frightening the
 people by his extreme ferocity, which nothing seemed able to subdue. Most
 of my informants were of the opinion that the stone was probably unlucky,?like
 the famous stone of the Sultan of Succadana, which in the old times had
 brought wars and untold calamities upon that country. Perhaps it was the
 same stone?one couldn't say. Indeed the story of a fabulously large
 emerald is as old as the arrival of the first white men in the
 Archipelago; and the belief in it is so persistent that less than forty
 years ago there had been an official Dutch inquiry into the truth of it.
 Such a jewel?it was explained to me by the old fellow from whom I
 heard most of this amazing Jim-myth?a sort of scribe to the wretched
 little Rajah of the place;?such a jewel, he said, cocking his poor
 purblind eyes up at me (he was sitting on the cabin floor out of respect),
 is best preserved by being concealed about the person of a woman. Yet it
 is not every woman that would do. She must be young?he sighed deeply?and
 insensible to the seductions of love. He shook his head sceptically. But
 such a woman seemed to be actually in existence. He had been told of a
 tall girl, whom the white man treated with great respect and care, and who
 never went forth from the house unattended. People said the white man
 could be seen with her almost any day; they walked side by side, openly,
 he holding her arm under his?pressed to his side?thus?in
 a most extraordinary way. This might be a lie, he conceded, for it was
 indeed a strange thing for any one to do: on the other hand, there could
 be no doubt she wore the white man's jewel concealed upon her bosom.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 29
 </h2>
 <p>
 'This was the theory of Jim's marital evening walks. I made a third on
 more than one occasion, unpleasantly aware every time of Cornelius, who
 nursed the aggrieved sense of his legal paternity, slinking in the
 neighbourhood with that peculiar twist of his mouth as if he were
 perpetually on the point of gnashing his teeth. But do you notice how,
 three hundred miles beyond the end of telegraph cables and mail-boat
 lines, the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilisation wither and die, to
 be replaced by pure exercises of imagination, that have the futility,
 often the charm, and sometimes the deep hidden truthfulness, of works of
 art? Romance had singled Jim for its own?and that was the true part
 of the story, which otherwise was all wrong. He did not hide his jewel. In
 fact, he was extremely proud of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It comes to me now that I had, on the whole, seen very little of her.
 What I remember best is the even, olive pallor of her complexion, and the
 intense blue-black gleams of her hair, flowing abundantly from under a
 small crimson cap she wore far back on her shapely head. Her movements
 were free, assured, and she blushed a dusky red. While Jim and I were
 talking, she would come and go with rapid glances at us, leaving on her
 passage an impression of grace and charm and a distinct suggestion of
 watchfulness. Her manner presented a curious combination of shyness and
 audacity. Every pretty smile was succeeded swiftly by a look of silent,
 repressed anxiety, as if put to flight by the recollection of some abiding
 danger. At times she would sit down with us and, with her soft cheek
 dimpled by the knuckles of her little hand, she would listen to our talk;
 her big clear eyes would remain fastened on our lips, as though each
 pronounced word had a visible shape. Her mother had taught her to read and
 write; she had learned a good bit of English from Jim, and she spoke it
 most amusingly, with his own clipping, boyish intonation. Her tenderness
 hovered over him like a flutter of wings. She lived so completely in his
 contemplation that she had acquired something of his outward aspect,
 something that recalled him in her movements, in the way she stretched her
 arm, turned her head, directed her glances. Her vigilant affection had an
 intensity that made it almost perceptible to the senses; it seemed
 actually to exist in the ambient matter of space, to envelop him like a
 peculiar fragrance, to dwell in the sunshine like a tremulous, subdued,
 and impassioned note. I suppose you think that I too am romantic, but it
 is a mistake. I am relating to you the sober impressions of a bit of
 youth, of a strange uneasy romance that had come in my way. I observed
 with interest the work of his?well?good fortune. He was
 jealously loved, but why she should be jealous, and of what, I could not
 tell. The land, the people, the forests were her accomplices, guarding him
 with vigilant accord, with an air of seclusion, of mystery, of invincible
 possession. There was no appeal, as it were; he was imprisoned within the
 very freedom of his power, and she, though ready to make a footstool of
 her head for his feet, guarded her conquest inflexibly?as though he
 were hard to keep. The very Tamb' Itam, marching on our journeys upon the
 heels of his white lord, with his head thrown back, truculent and
 be-weaponed like a janissary, with kriss, chopper, and lance (besides
 carrying Jim's gun); even Tamb' Itam allowed himself to put on the airs of
 uncompromising guardianship, like a surly devoted jailer ready to lay down
 his life for his captive. On the evenings when we sat up late, his silent,
 indistinct form would pass and repass under the verandah, with noiseless
 footsteps, or lifting my head I would unexpectedly make him out standing
 rigidly erect in the shadow. As a general rule he would vanish after a
 time, without a sound; but when we rose he would spring up close to us as
 if from the ground, ready for any orders Jim might wish to give. The girl
 too, I believe, never went to sleep till we had separated for the night.
 More than once I saw her and Jim through the window of my room come out
 together quietly and lean on the rough balustrade?two white forms
 very close, his arm about her waist, her head on his shoulder. Their soft
 murmurs reached me, penetrating, tender, with a calm sad note in the
 stillness of the night, like a self-communion of one being carried on in
 two tones. Later on, tossing on my bed under the mosquito-net, I was sure
 to hear slight creakings, faint breathing, a throat cleared cautiously?and
 I would know that Tamb' Itam was still on the prowl. Though he had (by the
 favour of the white lord) a house in the compound, had "taken wife," and
 had lately been blessed with a child, I believe that, during my stay at
 all events, he slept on the verandah every night. It was very difficult to
 make this faithful and grim retainer talk. Even Jim himself was answered
 in jerky short sentences, under protest as it were. Talking, he seemed to
 imply, was no business of his. The longest speech I heard him volunteer
 was one morning when, suddenly extending his hand towards the courtyard,
 he pointed at Cornelius and said, "Here comes the Nazarene." I don't think
 he was addressing me, though I stood at his side; his object seemed rather
 to awaken the indignant attention of the universe. Some muttered
 allusions, which followed, to dogs and the smell of roast-meat, struck me
 as singularly felicitous. The courtyard, a large square space, was one
 torrid blaze of sunshine, and, bathed in intense light, Cornelius was
 creeping across in full view with an inexpressible effect of stealthiness,
 of dark and secret slinking. He reminded one of everything that is
 unsavoury. His slow laborious walk resembled the creeping of a repulsive
 beetle, the legs alone moving with horrid industry while the body glided
 evenly. I suppose he made straight enough for the place where he wanted to
 get to, but his progress with one shoulder carried forward seemed oblique.
 He was often seen circling slowly amongst the sheds, as if following a
 scent; passing before the verandah with upward stealthy glances;
 disappearing without haste round the corner of some hut. That he seemed
 free of the place demonstrated Jim's absurd carelessness or else his
 infinite disdain, for Cornelius had played a very dubious part (to say the
 least of it) in a certain episode which might have ended fatally for Jim.
 As a matter of fact, it had redounded to his glory. But everything
 redounded to his glory; and it was the irony of his good fortune that he,
 who had been too careful of it once, seemed to bear a charmed life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'You must know he had left Doramin's place very soon after his arrival?much
 too soon, in fact, for his safety, and of course a long time before the
 war. In this he was actuated by a sense of duty; he had to look after
 Stein's business, he said. Hadn't he? To that end, with an utter disregard
 of his personal safety, he crossed the river and took up his quarters with
 Cornelius. How the latter had managed to exist through the troubled times
 I can't say. As Stein's agent, after all, he must have had Doramin's
 protection in a measure; and in one way or another he had managed to
 wriggle through all the deadly complications, while I have no doubt that
 his conduct, whatever line he was forced to take, was marked by that
 abjectness which was like the stamp of the man. That was his
 characteristic; he was fundamentally and outwardly abject, as other men
 are markedly of a generous, distinguished, or venerable appearance. It was
 the element of his nature which permeated all his acts and passions and
 emotions; he raged abjectly, smiled abjectly, was abjectly sad; his
 civilities and his indignations were alike abject. I am sure his love
 would have been the most abject of sentiments?but can one imagine a
 loathsome insect in love? And his loathsomeness, too, was abject, so that
 a simply disgusting person would have appeared noble by his side. He has
 his place neither in the background nor in the foreground of the story; he
 is simply seen skulking on its outskirts, enigmatical and unclean,
 tainting the fragrance of its youth and of its naiveness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His position in any case could not have been other than extremely
 miserable, yet it may very well be that he found some advantages in it.
 Jim told me he had been received at first with an abject display of the
 most amicable sentiments. "The fellow apparently couldn't contain himself
 for joy," said Jim with disgust. "He flew at me every morning to shake
 both my hands?confound him!?but I could never tell whether
 there would be any breakfast. If I got three meals in two days I
 considered myself jolly lucky, and he made me sign a chit for ten dollars
 every week. Said he was sure Mr. Stein did not mean him to keep me for
 nothing. Well?he kept me on nothing as near as possible. Put it down
 to the unsettled state of the country, and made as if to tear his hair
 out, begging my pardon twenty times a day, so that I had at last to
 entreat him not to worry. It made me sick. Half the roof of his house had
 fallen in, and the whole place had a mangy look, with wisps of dry grass
 sticking out and the corners of broken mats flapping on every wall. He did
 his best to make out that Mr. Stein owed him money on the last three
 years' trading, but his books were all torn, and some were missing. He
 tried to hint it was his late wife's fault. Disgusting scoundrel! At last
 I had to forbid him to mention his late wife at all. It made Jewel cry. I
 couldn't discover what became of all the trade-goods; there was nothing in
 the store but rats, having a high old time amongst a litter of brown paper
 and old sacking. I was assured on every hand that he had a lot of money
 buried somewhere, but of course could get nothing out of him. It was the
 most miserable existence I led there in that wretched house. I tried to do
 my duty by Stein, but I had also other matters to think of. When I escaped
 to Doramin old Tunku Allang got frightened and returned all my things. It
 was done in a roundabout way, and with no end of mystery, through a
 Chinaman who keeps a small shop here; but as soon as I left the Bugis
 quarter and went to live with Cornelius it began to be said openly that
 the Rajah had made up his mind to have me killed before long. Pleasant,
 wasn't it? And I couldn't see what there was to prevent him if he really
 <i>had</i> made up his mind. The worst of it was, I couldn't help feeling
 I wasn't doing any good either for Stein or for myself. Oh! it was beastly?the
 whole six weeks of it."'

 CHAPTER 30
 </h2>
 <p>
 'He told me further that he didn't know what made him hang on?but of
 course we may guess. He sympathised deeply with the defenceless girl, at
 the mercy of that "mean, cowardly scoundrel." It appears Cornelius led her
 an awful life, stopping only short of actual ill-usage, for which he had
 not the pluck, I suppose. He insisted upon her calling him father?"and
 with respect, too?with respect," he would scream, shaking a little
 yellow fist in her face. "I am a respectable man, and what are you? Tell
 me?what are you? You think I am going to bring up somebody else's
 child and not be treated with respect? You ought to be glad I let you.
 Come?say Yes, father. . . . No? . . . You wait a bit." Thereupon he
 would begin to abuse the dead woman, till the girl would run off with her
 hands to her head. He pursued her, dashing in and out and round the house
 and amongst the sheds, would drive her into some corner, where she would
 fall on her knees stopping her ears, and then he would stand at a distance
 and declaim filthy denunciations at her back for half an hour at a
 stretch. "Your mother was a devil, a deceitful devil?and you too are
 a devil," he would shriek in a final outburst, pick up a bit of dry earth
 or a handful of mud (there was plenty of mud around the house), and fling
 it into her hair. Sometimes, though, she would hold out full of scorn,
 confronting him in silence, her face sombre and contracted, and only now
 and then uttering a word or two that would make the other jump and writhe
 with the sting. Jim told me these scenes were terrible. It was indeed a
 strange thing to come upon in a wilderness. The endlessness of such a
 subtly cruel situation was appalling?if you think of it. The
 respectable Cornelius (Inchi 'Nelyus the Malays called him, with a grimace
 that meant many things) was a much-disappointed man. I don't know what he
 had expected would be done for him in consideration of his marriage; but
 evidently the liberty to steal, and embezzle, and appropriate to himself
 for many years and in any way that suited him best, the goods of Stein's
 Trading Company (Stein kept the supply up unfalteringly as long as he
 could get his skippers to take it there) did not seem to him a fair
 equivalent for the sacrifice of his honourable name. Jim would have
 enjoyed exceedingly thrashing Cornelius within an inch of his life; on the
 other hand, the scenes were of so painful a character, so abominable, that
 his impulse would be to get out of earshot, in order to spare the girl's
 feelings. They left her agitated, speechless, clutching her bosom now and
 then with a stony, desperate face, and then Jim would lounge up and say
 unhappily, "Now?come?really?what's the use?you
 must try to eat a bit," or give some such mark of sympathy. Cornelius
 would keep on slinking through the doorways, across the verandah and back
 again, as mute as a fish, and with malevolent, mistrustful, underhand
 glances. "I can stop his game," Jim said to her once. "Just say the word."
 And do you know what she answered? She said?Jim told me impressively?that
 if she had not been sure he was intensely wretched himself, she would have
 found the courage to kill him with her own hands. "Just fancy that! The
 poor devil of a girl, almost a child, being driven to talk like that," he
 exclaimed in horror. It seemed impossible to save her not only from that
 mean rascal but even from herself! It wasn't that he pitied her so much,
 he affirmed; it was more than pity; it was as if he had something on his
 conscience, while that life went on. To leave the house would have
 appeared a base desertion. He had understood at last that there was
 nothing to expect from a longer stay, neither accounts nor money, nor
 truth of any sort, but he stayed on, exasperating Cornelius to the verge,
 I won't say of insanity, but almost of courage. Meantime he felt all sorts
 of dangers gathering obscurely about him. Doramin had sent over twice a
 trusty servant to tell him seriously that he could do nothing for his
 safety unless he would recross the river again and live amongst the Bugis
 as at first. People of every condition used to call, often in the dead of
 night, in order to disclose to him plots for his assassination. He was to
 be poisoned. He was to be stabbed in the bath-house. Arrangements were
 being made to have him shot from a boat on the river. Each of these
 informants professed himself to be his very good friend. It was enough?he
 told me?to spoil a fellow's rest for ever. Something of the kind was
 extremely possible?nay, probable?but the lying warnings gave
 him only the sense of deadly scheming going on all around him, on all
 sides, in the dark. Nothing more calculated to shake the best of nerve.
 Finally, one night, Cornelius himself, with a great apparatus of alarm and
 secrecy, unfolded in solemn wheedling tones a little plan wherein for one
 hundred dollars?or even for eighty; let's say eighty?he,
 Cornelius, would procure a trustworthy man to smuggle Jim out of the
 river, all safe. There was nothing else for it now?if Jim cared a
 pin for his life. What's eighty dollars? A trifle. An insignificant sum.
 While he, Cornelius, who had to remain behind, was absolutely courting
 death by this proof of devotion to Mr. Stein's young friend. The sight of
 his abject grimacing was?Jim told me?very hard to bear: he
 clutched at his hair, beat his breast, rocked himself to and fro with his
 hands pressed to his stomach, and actually pretended to shed tears. "Your
 blood be on your own head," he squeaked at last, and rushed out. It is a
 curious question how far Cornelius was sincere in that performance. Jim
 confessed to me that he did not sleep a wink after the fellow had gone. He
 lay on his back on a thin mat spread over the bamboo flooring, trying idly
 to make out the bare rafters, and listening to the rustlings in the torn
 thatch. A star suddenly twinkled through a hole in the roof. His brain was
 in a whirl; but, nevertheless, it was on that very night that he matured
 his plan for overcoming Sherif Ali. It had been the thought of all the
 moments he could spare from the hopeless investigation into Stein's
 affairs, but the notion?he says?came to him then all at once.
 He could see, as it were, the guns mounted on the top of the hill. He got
 very hot and excited lying there; sleep was out of the question more than
 ever. He jumped up, and went out barefooted on the verandah. Walking
 silently, he came upon the girl, motionless against the wall, as if on the
 watch. In his then state of mind it did not surprise him to see her up,
 nor yet to hear her ask in an anxious whisper where Cornelius could be. He
 simply said he did not know. She moaned a little, and peered into the
 campong. Everything was very quiet. He was possessed by his new idea, and
 so full of it that he could not help telling the girl all about it at
 once. She listened, clapped her hands lightly, whispered softly her
 admiration, but was evidently on the alert all the time. It seems he had
 been used to make a confidant of her all along?and that she on her
 part could and did give him a lot of useful hints as to Patusan affairs
 there is no doubt. He assured me more than once that he had never found
 himself the worse for her advice. At any rate, he was proceeding to
 explain his plan fully to her there and then, when she pressed his arm
 once, and vanished from his side. Then Cornelius appeared from somewhere,
 and, perceiving Jim, ducked sideways, as though he had been shot at, and
 afterwards stood very still in the dusk. At last he came forward
 prudently, like a suspicious cat. "There were some fishermen there?with
 fish," he said in a shaky voice. "To sell fish?you understand." . .
 . It must have been then two o'clock in the morning?a likely time
 for anybody to hawk fish about!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim, however, let the statement pass, and did not give it a single
 thought. Other matters occupied his mind, and besides he had neither seen
 nor heard anything. He contented himself by saying, "Oh!" absently, got a
 drink of water out of a pitcher standing there, and leaving Cornelius a
 prey to some inexplicable emotion?that made him embrace with both
 arms the worm-eaten rail of the verandah as if his legs had failed?went
 in again and lay down on his mat to think. By-and-by he heard stealthy
 footsteps. They stopped. A voice whispered tremulously through the wall,
 "Are you asleep?" "No! What is it?" he answered briskly, and there was an
 abrupt movement outside, and then all was still, as if the whisperer had
 been startled. Extremely annoyed at this, Jim came out impetuously, and
 Cornelius with a faint shriek fled along the verandah as far as the steps,
 where he hung on to the broken banister. Very puzzled, Jim called out to
 him from the distance to know what the devil he meant. "Have you given
 your consideration to what I spoke to you about?" asked Cornelius,
 pronouncing the words with difficulty, like a man in the cold fit of a
 fever. "No!" shouted Jim in a passion. "I have not, and I don't intend to.
 I am going to live here, in Patusan." "You shall d-d-die h-h-here,"
 answered Cornelius, still shaking violently, and in a sort of expiring
 voice. The whole performance was so absurd and provoking that Jim didn't
 know whether he ought to be amused or angry. "Not till I have seen you
 tucked away, you bet," he called out, exasperated yet ready to laugh. Half
 seriously (being excited with his own thoughts, you know) he went on
 shouting, "Nothing can touch me! You can do your damnedest." Somehow the
 shadowy Cornelius far off there seemed to be the hateful embodiment of all
 the annoyances and difficulties he had found in his path. He let himself
 go?his nerves had been over-wrought for days?and called him
 many pretty names,?swindler, liar, sorry rascal: in fact, carried on
 in an extraordinary way. He admits he passed all bounds, that he was quite
 beside himself?defied all Patusan to scare him away?declared
 he would make them all dance to his own tune yet, and so on, in a
 menacing, boasting strain. Perfectly bombastic and ridiculous, he said.
 His ears burned at the bare recollection. Must have been off his chump in
 some way. . . . The girl, who was sitting with us, nodded her little head
 at me quickly, frowned faintly, and said, "I heard him," with child-like
 solemnity. He laughed and blushed. What stopped him at last, he said, was
 the silence, the complete deathlike silence, of the indistinct figure far
 over there, that seemed to hang collapsed, doubled over the rail in a
 weird immobility. He came to his senses, and ceasing suddenly, wondered
 greatly at himself. He watched for a while. Not a stir, not a sound.
 "Exactly as if the chap had died while I had been making all that noise,"
 he said. He was so ashamed of himself that he went indoors in a hurry
 without another word, and flung himself down again. The row seemed to have
 done him good though, because he went to sleep for the rest of the night
 like a baby. Hadn't slept like that for weeks. "But <i>I</i> didn't
 sleep," struck in the girl, one elbow on the table and nursing her cheek.
 "I watched." Her big eyes flashed, rolling a little, and then she fixed
 them on my face intently.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 31
 </h2>
 <p>
 'You may imagine with what interest I listened. All these details were
 perceived to have some significance twenty-four hours later. In the
 morning Cornelius made no allusion to the events of the night. "I suppose
 you will come back to my poor house," he muttered, surlily, slinking up
 just as Jim was entering the canoe to go over to Doramin's campong. Jim
 only nodded, without looking at him. "You find it good fun, no doubt,"
 muttered the other in a sour tone. Jim spent the day with the old nakhoda,
 preaching the necessity of vigorous action to the principal men of the
 Bugis community, who had been summoned for a big talk. He remembered with
 pleasure how very eloquent and persuasive he had been. "I managed to put
 some backbone into them that time, and no mistake," he said. Sherif Ali's
 last raid had swept the outskirts of the settlement, and some women
 belonging to the town had been carried off to the stockade. Sherif Ali's
 emissaries had been seen in the market-place the day before, strutting
 about haughtily in white cloaks, and boasting of the Rajah's friendship
 for their master. One of them stood forward in the shade of a tree, and,
 leaning on the long barrel of a rifle, exhorted the people to prayer and
 repentance, advising them to kill all the strangers in their midst, some
 of whom, he said, were infidels and others even worse?children of
 Satan in the guise of Moslems. It was reported that several of the Rajah's
 people amongst the listeners had loudly expressed their approbation. The
 terror amongst the common people was intense. Jim, immensely pleased with
 his day's work, crossed the river again before sunset.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'As he had got the Bugis irretrievably committed to action and had made
 himself responsible for success on his own head, he was so elated that in
 the lightness of his heart he absolutely tried to be civil with Cornelius.
 But Cornelius became wildly jovial in response, and it was almost more
 than he could stand, he says, to hear his little squeaks of false
 laughter, to see him wriggle and blink, and suddenly catch hold of his
 chin and crouch low over the table with a distracted stare. The girl did
 not show herself, and Jim retired early. When he rose to say good-night,
 Cornelius jumped up, knocking his chair over, and ducked out of sight as
 if to pick up something he had dropped. His good-night came huskily from
 under the table. Jim was amazed to see him emerge with a dropping jaw, and
 staring, stupidly frightened eyes. He clutched the edge of the table.
 "What's the matter? Are you unwell?" asked Jim. "Yes, yes, yes. A great
 colic in my stomach," says the other; and it is Jim's opinion that it was
 perfectly true. If so, it was, in view of his contemplated action, an
 abject sign of a still imperfect callousness for which he must be given
 all due credit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Be it as it may, Jim's slumbers were disturbed by a dream of heavens like
 brass resounding with a great voice, which called upon him to Awake!
 Awake! so loud that, notwithstanding his desperate determination to sleep
 on, he did wake up in reality. The glare of a red spluttering
 conflagration going on in mid-air fell on his eyes. Coils of black thick
 smoke curved round the head of some apparition, some unearthly being, all
 in white, with a severe, drawn, anxious face. After a second or so he
 recognised the girl. She was holding a dammar torch at arm's-length aloft,
 and in a persistent, urgent monotone she was repeating, "Get up! Get up!
 Get up!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Suddenly he leaped to his feet; at once she put into his hand a revolver,
 his own revolver, which had been hanging on a nail, but loaded this time.
 He gripped it in silence, bewildered, blinking in the light. He wondered
 what he could do for her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She asked rapidly and very low, "Can you face four men with this?" He
 laughed while narrating this part at the recollection of his polite
 alacrity. It seems he made a great display of it. "Certainly?of
 course?certainly?command me." He was not properly awake, and
 had a notion of being very civil in these extraordinary circumstances, of
 showing his unquestioning, devoted readiness. She left the room, and he
 followed her; in the passage they disturbed an old hag who did the casual
 cooking of the household, though she was so decrepit as to be hardly able
 to understand human speech. She got up and hobbled behind them, mumbling
 toothlessly. On the verandah a hammock of sail-cloth, belonging to
 Cornelius, swayed lightly to the touch of Jim's elbow. It was empty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The Patusan establishment, like all the posts of Stein's Trading Company,
 had originally consisted of four buildings. Two of them were represented
 by two heaps of sticks, broken bamboos, rotten thatch, over which the four
 corner-posts of hardwood leaned sadly at different angles: the principal
 storeroom, however, stood yet, facing the agent's house. It was an oblong
 hut, built of mud and clay; it had at one end a wide door of stout
 planking, which so far had not come off the hinges, and in one of the side
 walls there was a square aperture, a sort of window, with three wooden
 bars. Before descending the few steps the girl turned her face over her
 shoulder and said quickly, "You were to be set upon while you slept." Jim
 tells me he experienced a sense of deception. It was the old story. He was
 weary of these attempts upon his life. He had had his fill of these
 alarms. He was sick of them. He assured me he was angry with the girl for
 deceiving him. He had followed her under the impression that it was she
 who wanted his help, and now he had half a mind to turn on his heel and go
 back in disgust. "Do you know," he commented profoundly, "I rather think I
 was not quite myself for whole weeks on end about that time." "Oh yes. You
 were though," I couldn't help contradicting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But she moved on swiftly, and he followed her into the courtyard. All its
 fences had fallen in a long time ago; the neighbours' buffaloes would pace
 in the morning across the open space, snorting profoundly, without haste;
 the very jungle was invading it already. Jim and the girl stopped in the
 rank grass. The light in which they stood made a dense blackness all
 round, and only above their heads there was an opulent glitter of stars.
 He told me it was a beautiful night?quite cool, with a little stir
 of breeze from the river. It seems he noticed its friendly beauty.
 Remember this is a love story I am telling you now. A lovely night seemed
 to breathe on them a soft caress. The flame of the torch streamed now and
 then with a fluttering noise like a flag, and for a time this was the only
 sound. "They are in the storeroom waiting," whispered the girl; "they are
 waiting for the signal." "Who's to give it?" he asked. She shook the
 torch, which blazed up after a shower of sparks. "Only you have been
 sleeping so restlessly," she continued in a murmur; "I watched your sleep,
 too." "You!" he exclaimed, craning his neck to look about him. "You think
 I watched on this night only!" she said, with a sort of despairing
 indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He says it was as if he had received a blow on the chest. He gasped. He
 thought he had been an awful brute somehow, and he felt remorseful,
 touched, happy, elated. This, let me remind you again, is a love story;
 you can see it by the imbecility, not a repulsive imbecility, the exalted
 imbecility of these proceedings, this station in torchlight, as if they
 had come there on purpose to have it out for the edification of concealed
 murderers. If Sherif Ali's emissaries had been possessed?as Jim
 remarked?of a pennyworth of spunk, this was the time to make a rush.
 His heart was thumping?not with fear?but he seemed to hear the
 grass rustle, and he stepped smartly out of the light. Something dark,
 imperfectly seen, flitted rapidly out of sight. He called out in a strong
 voice, "Cornelius! O Cornelius!" A profound silence succeeded: his voice
 did not seem to have carried twenty feet. Again the girl was by his side.
 "Fly!" she said. The old woman was coming up; her broken figure hovered in
 crippled little jumps on the edge of the light; they heard her mumbling,
 and a light, moaning sigh. "Fly!" repeated the girl excitedly. "They are
 frightened now?this light?the voices. They know you are awake
 now?they know you are big, strong, fearless . . ." "If I am all
 that," he began; but she interrupted him: "Yes?to-night! But what of
 to-morrow night? Of the next night? Of the night after?of all the
 many, many nights? Can I be always watching?" A sobbing catch of her
 breath affected him beyond the power of words.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He told me that he had never felt so small, so powerless?and as to
 courage, what was the good of it? he thought. He was so helpless that even
 flight seemed of no use; and though she kept on whispering, "Go to
 Doramin, go to Doramin," with feverish insistence, he realised that for
 him there was no refuge from that loneliness which centupled all his
 dangers except?in her. "I thought," he said to me, "that if I went
 away from her it would be the end of everything somehow." Only as they
 couldn't stop there for ever in the middle of that courtyard, he made up
 his mind to go and look into the storehouse. He let her follow him without
 thinking of any protest, as if they had been indissolubly united. "I am
 fearless?am I?" he muttered through his teeth. She restrained his
 arm. "Wait till you hear my voice," she said, and, torch in hand, ran
 lightly round the corner. He remained alone in the darkness, his face to
 the door: not a sound, not a breath came from the other side. The old hag
 let out a dreary groan somewhere behind his back. He heard a high-pitched
 almost screaming call from the girl. "Now! Push!" He pushed violently; the
 door swung with a creak and a clatter, disclosing to his intense
 astonishment the low dungeon-like interior illuminated by a lurid,
 wavering glare. A turmoil of smoke eddied down upon an empty wooden crate
 in the middle of the floor, a litter of rags and straw tried to soar, but
 only stirred feebly in the draught. She had thrust the light through the
 bars of the window. He saw her bare round arm extended and rigid, holding
 up the torch with the steadiness of an iron bracket. A conical ragged heap
 of old mats cumbered a distant corner almost to the ceiling, and that was
 all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He explained to me that he was bitterly disappointed at this. His
 fortitude had been tried by so many warnings, he had been for weeks
 surrounded by so many hints of danger, that he wanted the relief of some
 reality, of something tangible that he could meet. "It would have cleared
 the air for a couple of hours at least, if you know what I mean," he said
 to me. "Jove! I had been living for days with a stone on my chest." Now at
 last he had thought he would get hold of something, and?nothing! Not
 a trace, not a sign of anybody. He had raised his weapon as the door flew
 open, but now his arm fell. "Fire! Defend yourself," the girl outside
 cried in an agonising voice. She, being in the dark and with her arm
 thrust in to the shoulder through the small hole, couldn't see what was
 going on, and she dared not withdraw the torch now to run round. "There's
 nobody here!" yelled Jim contemptuously, but his impulse to burst into a
 resentful exasperated laugh died without a sound: he had perceived in the
 very act of turning away that he was exchanging glances with a pair of
 eyes in the heap of mats. He saw a shifting gleam of whites. "Come out!"
 he cried in a fury, a little doubtful, and a dark-faced head, a head
 without a body, shaped itself in the rubbish, a strangely detached head,
 that looked at him with a steady scowl. Next moment the whole mound
 stirred, and with a low grunt a man emerged swiftly, and bounded towards
 Jim. Behind him the mats as it were jumped and flew, his right arm was
 raised with a crooked elbow, and the dull blade of a kriss protruded from
 his fist held off, a little above his head. A cloth wound tight round his
 loins seemed dazzlingly white on his bronze skin; his naked body glistened
 as if wet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim noted all this. He told me he was experiencing a feeling of
 unutterable relief, of vengeful elation. He held his shot, he says,
 deliberately. He held it for the tenth part of a second, for three strides
 of the man?an unconscionable time. He held it for the pleasure of
 saying to himself, That's a dead man! He was absolutely positive and
 certain. He let him come on because it did not matter. A dead man, anyhow.
 He noticed the dilated nostrils, the wide eyes, the intent, eager
 stillness of the face, and then he fired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The explosion in that confined space was stunning. He stepped back a
 pace. He saw the man jerk his head up, fling his arms forward, and drop
 the kriss. He ascertained afterwards that he had shot him through the
 mouth, a little upwards, the bullet coming out high at the back of the
 skull. With the impetus of his rush the man drove straight on, his face
 suddenly gaping disfigured, with his hands open before him gropingly, as
 though blinded, and landed with terrific violence on his forehead, just
 short of Jim's bare toes. Jim says he didn't lose the smallest detail of
 all this. He found himself calm, appeased, without rancour, without
 uneasiness, as if the death of that man had atoned for everything. The
 place was getting very full of sooty smoke from the torch, in which the
 unswaying flame burned blood-red without a flicker. He walked in
 resolutely, striding over the dead body, and covered with his revolver
 another naked figure outlined vaguely at the other end. As he was about to
 pull the trigger, the man threw away with force a short heavy spear, and
 squatted submissively on his hams, his back to the wall and his clasped
 hands between his legs. "You want your life?" Jim said. The other made no
 sound. "How many more of you?" asked Jim again. "Two more, Tuan," said the
 man very softly, looking with big fascinated eyes into the muzzle of the
 revolver. Accordingly two more crawled from under the mats, holding out
 ostentatiously their empty hands.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 32
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Jim took up an advantageous position and shepherded them out in a bunch
 through the doorway: all that time the torch had remained vertical in the
 grip of a little hand, without so much as a tremble. The three men obeyed
 him, perfectly mute, moving automatically. He ranged them in a row. "Link
 arms!" he ordered. They did so. "The first who withdraws his arm or turns
 his head is a dead man," he said. "March!" They stepped out together,
 rigidly; he followed, and at the side the girl, in a trailing white gown,
 her black hair falling as low as her waist, bore the light. Erect and
 swaying, she seemed to glide without touching the earth; the only sound
 was the silky swish and rustle of the long grass. "Stop!" cried Jim.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The river-bank was steep; a great freshness ascended, the light fell on
 the edge of smooth dark water frothing without a ripple; right and left
 the shapes of the houses ran together below the sharp outlines of the
 roofs. "Take my greetings to Sherif Ali?till I come myself," said
 Jim. Not one head of the three budged. "Jump!" he thundered. The three
 splashes made one splash, a shower flew up, black heads bobbed
 convulsively, and disappeared; but a great blowing and spluttering went
 on, growing faint, for they were diving industriously in great fear of a
 parting shot. Jim turned to the girl, who had been a silent and attentive
 observer. His heart seemed suddenly to grow too big for his breast and
 choke him in the hollow of his throat. This probably made him speechless
 for so long, and after returning his gaze she flung the burning torch with
 a wide sweep of the arm into the river. The ruddy fiery glare, taking a
 long flight through the night, sank with a vicious hiss, and the calm soft
 starlight descended upon them, unchecked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He did not tell me what it was he said when at last he recovered his
 voice. I don't suppose he could be very eloquent. The world was still, the
 night breathed on them, one of those nights that seem created for the
 sheltering of tenderness, and there are moments when our souls, as if
 freed from their dark envelope, glow with an exquisite sensibility that
 makes certain silences more lucid than speeches. As to the girl, he told
 me, "She broke down a bit. Excitement?don't you know. Reaction.
 Deucedly tired she must have been?and all that kind of thing. And?and?hang
 it all?she was fond of me, don't you see. . . . I too . . . didn't
 know, of course . . . never entered my head . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Then he got up and began to walk about in some agitation. "I?I love
 her dearly. More than I can tell. Of course one cannot tell. You take a
 different view of your actions when you come to understand, when you are
 <i>made</i> to understand every day that your existence is necessary?you
 see, absolutely necessary?to another person. I am made to feel that.
 Wonderful! But only try to think what her life has been. It is too
 extravagantly awful! Isn't it? And me finding her here like this?as
 you may go out for a stroll and come suddenly upon somebody drowning in a
 lonely dark place. Jove! No time to lose. Well, it is a trust too . . . I
 believe I am equal to it . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I must tell you the girl had left us to ourselves some time before. He
 slapped his chest. "Yes! I feel that, but I believe I am equal to all my
 luck!" He had the gift of finding a special meaning in everything that
 happened to him. This was the view he took of his love affair; it was
 idyllic, a little solemn, and also true, since his belief had all the
 unshakable seriousness of youth. Some time after, on another occasion, he
 said to me, "I've been only two years here, and now, upon my word, I can't
 conceive being able to live anywhere else. The very thought of the world
 outside is enough to give me a fright; because, don't you see," he
 continued, with downcast eyes watching the action of his boot busied in
 squashing thoroughly a tiny bit of dried mud (we were strolling on the
 river-bank)?"because I have not forgotten why I came here. Not yet!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I refrained from looking at him, but I think I heard a short sigh; we
 took a turn or two in silence. "Upon my soul and conscience," he began
 again, "if such a thing can be forgotten, then I think I have a right to
 dismiss it from my mind. Ask any man here" . . . his voice changed. "Is it
 not strange," he went on in a gentle, almost yearning tone, "that all
 these people, all these people who would do anything for me, can never be
 made to understand? Never! If you disbelieved me I could not call them up.
 It seems hard, somehow. I am stupid, am I not? What more can I want? If
 you ask them who is brave?who is true?who is just?who is
 it they would trust with their lives??they would say, Tuan Jim. And
 yet they can never know the real, real truth . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'That's what he said to me on my last day with him. I did not let a murmur
 escape me: I felt he was going to say more, and come no nearer to the root
 of the matter. The sun, whose concentrated glare dwarfs the earth into a
 restless mote of dust, had sunk behind the forest, and the diffused light
 from an opal sky seemed to cast upon a world without shadows and without
 brilliance the illusion of a calm and pensive greatness. I don't know why,
 listening to him, I should have noted so distinctly the gradual darkening
 of the river, of the air; the irresistible slow work of the night settling
 silently on all the visible forms, effacing the outlines, burying the
 shapes deeper and deeper, like a steady fall of impalpable black dust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Jove!" he began abruptly, "there are days when a fellow is too absurd
 for anything; only I know I can tell you what I like. I talk about being
 done with it?with the bally thing at the back of my head . . .
 Forgetting . . . Hang me if I know! I can think of it quietly. After all,
 what has it proved? Nothing. I suppose you don't think so . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I made a protesting murmur.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"No matter," he said. "I am satisfied . . . nearly. I've got to look only
 at the face of the first man that comes along, to regain my confidence.
 They can't be made to understand what is going on in me. What of that?
 Come! I haven't done so badly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Not so badly," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"But all the same, you wouldn't like to have me aboard your own ship
 hey?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Confound you!" I cried. "Stop this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Aha! You see," he said, crowing, as it were, over me placidly. "Only,"
 he went on, "you just try to tell this to any of them here. They would
 think you a fool, a liar, or worse. And so I can stand it. I've done a
 thing or two for them, but this is what they have done for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"My dear chap," I cried, "you shall always remain for them an insoluble
 mystery." Thereupon we were silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Mystery," he repeated, before looking up. "Well, then let me always
 remain here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'After the sun had set, the darkness seemed to drive upon us, borne in
 every faint puff of the breeze. In the middle of a hedged path I saw the
 arrested, gaunt, watchful, and apparently one-legged silhouette of Tamb'
 Itam; and across the dusky space my eye detected something white moving to
 and fro behind the supports of the roof. As soon as Jim, with Tamb' Itam
 at his heels, had started upon his evening rounds, I went up to the house
 alone, and, unexpectedly, found myself waylaid by the girl, who had been
 clearly waiting for this opportunity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It is hard to tell you what it was precisely she wanted to wrest from me.
 Obviously it would be something very simple?the simplest
 impossibility in the world; as, for instance, the exact description of the
 form of a cloud. She wanted an assurance, a statement, a promise, an
 explanation?I don't know how to call it: the thing has no name. It
 was dark under the projecting roof, and all I could see were the flowing
 lines of her gown, the pale small oval of her face, with the white flash
 of her teeth, and, turned towards me, the big sombre orbits of her eyes,
 where there seemed to be a faint stir, such as you may fancy you can
 detect when you plunge your gaze to the bottom of an immensely deep well.
 What is it that moves there? you ask yourself. Is it a blind monster or
 only a lost gleam from the universe? It occurred to me?don't laugh?that
 all things being dissimilar, she was more inscrutable in her childish
 ignorance than the Sphinx propounding childish riddles to wayfarers. She
 had been carried off to Patusan before her eyes were open. She had grown
 up there; she had seen nothing, she had known nothing, she had no
 conception of anything. I ask myself whether she were sure that anything
 else existed. What notions she may have formed of the outside world is to
 me inconceivable: all that she knew of its inhabitants were a betrayed
 woman and a sinister pantaloon. Her lover also came to her from there,
 gifted with irresistible seductions; but what would become of her if he
 should return to these inconceivable regions that seemed always to claim
 back their own? Her mother had warned her of this with tears, before she
 died . . .
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She had caught hold of my arm firmly, and as soon as I had stopped she
 had withdrawn her hand in haste. She was audacious and shrinking. She
 feared nothing, but she was checked by the profound incertitude and the
 extreme strangeness?a brave person groping in the dark. I belonged
 to this Unknown that might claim Jim for its own at any moment. I was, as
 it were, in the secret of its nature and of its intentions?the
 confidant of a threatening mystery?armed with its power perhaps! I
 believe she supposed I could with a word whisk Jim away out of her very
 arms; it is my sober conviction she went through agonies of apprehension
 during my long talks with Jim; through a real and intolerable anguish that
 might have conceivably driven her into plotting my murder, had the
 fierceness of her soul been equal to the tremendous situation it had
 created. This is my impression, and it is all I can give you: the whole
 thing dawned gradually upon me, and as it got clearer and clearer I was
 overwhelmed by a slow incredulous amazement. She made me believe her, but
 there is no word that on my lips could render the effect of the headlong
 and vehement whisper, of the soft, passionate tones, of the sudden
 breathless pause and the appealing movement of the white arms extended
 swiftly. They fell; the ghostly figure swayed like a slender tree in the
 wind, the pale oval of the face drooped; it was impossible to distinguish
 her features, the darkness of the eyes was unfathomable; two wide sleeves
 uprose in the dark like unfolding wings, and she stood silent, holding her
 head in her hands.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 33
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I was immensely touched: her youth, her ignorance, her pretty beauty,
 which had the simple charm and the delicate vigour of a wild-flower, her
 pathetic pleading, her helplessness, appealed to me with almost the
 strength of her own unreasonable and natural fear. She feared the unknown
 as we all do, and her ignorance made the unknown infinitely vast. I stood
 for it, for myself, for you fellows, for all the world that neither cared
 for Jim nor needed him in the least. I would have been ready enough to
 answer for the indifference of the teeming earth but for the reflection
 that he too belonged to this mysterious unknown of her fears, and that,
 however much I stood for, I did not stand for him. This made me hesitate.
 A murmur of hopeless pain unsealed my lips. I began by protesting that I
 at least had come with no intention to take Jim away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Why did I come, then? After a slight movement she was as still as a
 marble statue in the night. I tried to explain briefly: friendship,
 business; if I had any wish in the matter it was rather to see him stay. .
 . . "They always leave us," she murmured. The breath of sad wisdom from
 the grave which her piety wreathed with flowers seemed to pass in a faint
 sigh. . . . Nothing, I said, could separate Jim from her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It is my firm conviction now; it was my conviction at the time; it was
 the only possible conclusion from the facts of the case. It was not made
 more certain by her whispering in a tone in which one speaks to oneself,
 "He swore this to me." "Did you ask him?" I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She made a step nearer. "No. Never!" She had asked him only to go away.
 It was that night on the river-bank, after he had killed the man?after
 she had flung the torch in the water because he was looking at her so.
 There was too much light, and the danger was over then?for a little
 time?for a little time. He said then he would not abandon her to
 Cornelius. She had insisted. She wanted him to leave her. He said that he
 could not?that it was impossible. He trembled while he said this.
 She had felt him tremble. . . . One does not require much imagination to
 see the scene, almost to hear their whispers. She was afraid for him too.
 I believe that then she saw in him only a predestined victim of dangers
 which she understood better than himself. Though by nothing but his mere
 presence he had mastered her heart, had filled all her thoughts, and had
 possessed himself of all her affections, she underestimated his chances of
 success. It is obvious that at about that time everybody was inclined to
 underestimate his chances. Strictly speaking he didn't seem to have any. I
 know this was Cornelius's view. He confessed that much to me in
 extenuation of the shady part he had played in Sherif Ali's plot to do
 away with the infidel. Even Sherif Ali himself, as it seems certain now,
 had nothing but contempt for the white man. Jim was to be murdered mainly
 on religious grounds, I believe. A simple act of piety (and so far
 infinitely meritorious), but otherwise without much importance. In the
 last part of this opinion Cornelius concurred. "Honourable sir," he argued
 abjectly on the only occasion he managed to have me to himself?"honourable
 sir, how was I to know? Who was he? What could he do to make people
 believe him? What did Mr. Stein mean sending a boy like that to talk big
 to an old servant? I was ready to save him for eighty dollars. Only eighty
 dollars. Why didn't the fool go? Was I to get stabbed myself for the sake
 of a stranger?" He grovelled in spirit before me, with his body doubled up
 insinuatingly and his hands hovering about my knees, as though he were
 ready to embrace my legs. "What's eighty dollars? An insignificant sum to
 give to a defenceless old man ruined for life by a deceased she-devil."
 Here he wept. But I anticipate. I didn't that night chance upon Cornelius
 till I had had it out with the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She was unselfish when she urged Jim to leave her, and even to leave the
 country. It was his danger that was foremost in her thoughts?even if
 she wanted to save herself too?perhaps unconsciously: but then look
 at the warning she had, look at the lesson that could be drawn from every
 moment of the recently ended life in which all her memories were centred.
 She fell at his feet?she told me so?there by the river, in the
 discreet light of stars which showed nothing except great masses of silent
 shadows, indefinite open spaces, and trembling faintly upon the broad
 stream made it appear as wide as the sea. He had lifted her up. He lifted
 her up, and then she would struggle no more. Of course not. Strong arms, a
 tender voice, a stalwart shoulder to rest her poor lonely little head
 upon. The need?the infinite need?of all this for the aching
 heart, for the bewildered mind;?the promptings of youth?the
 necessity of the moment. What would you have? One understands?unless
 one is incapable of understanding anything under the sun. And so she was
 content to be lifted up?and held. "You know?Jove! this is
 serious?no nonsense in it!" as Jim had whispered hurriedly with a
 troubled concerned face on the threshold of his house. I don't know so
 much about nonsense, but there was nothing light-hearted in their romance:
 they came together under the shadow of a life's disaster, like knight and
 maiden meeting to exchange vows amongst haunted ruins. The starlight was
 good enough for that story, a light so faint and remote that it cannot
 resolve shadows into shapes, and show the other shore of a stream. I did
 look upon the stream that night and from the very place; it rolled silent
 and as black as Styx: the next day I went away, but I am not likely to
 forget what it was she wanted to be saved from when she entreated him to
 leave her while there was time. She told me what it was, calmed?she
 was now too passionately interested for mere excitement?in a voice
 as quiet in the obscurity as her white half-lost figure. She told me, "I
 didn't want to die weeping." I thought I had not heard aright.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You did not want to die weeping?" I repeated after her. "Like my
 mother," she added readily. The outlines of her white shape did not stir
 in the least. "My mother had wept bitterly before she died," she
 explained. An inconceivable calmness seemed to have risen from the ground
 around us, imperceptibly, like the still rise of a flood in the night,
 obliterating the familiar landmarks of emotions. There came upon me, as
 though I had felt myself losing my footing in the midst of waters, a
 sudden dread, the dread of the unknown depths. She went on explaining
 that, during the last moments, being alone with her mother, she had to
 leave the side of the couch to go and set her back against the door, in
 order to keep Cornelius out. He desired to get in, and kept on drumming
 with both fists, only desisting now and again to shout huskily, "Let me
 in! Let me in! Let me in!" In a far corner upon a few mats the moribund
 woman, already speechless and unable to lift her arm, rolled her head
 over, and with a feeble movement of her hand seemed to command?"No!
 No!" and the obedient daughter, setting her shoulders with all her
 strength against the door, was looking on. "The tears fell from her eyes?and
 then she died," concluded the girl in an imperturbable monotone, which
 more than anything else, more than the white statuesque immobility of her
 person, more than mere words could do, troubled my mind profoundly with
 the passive, irremediable horror of the scene. It had the power to drive
 me out of my conception of existence, out of that shelter each of us makes
 for himself to creep under in moments of danger, as a tortoise withdraws
 within its shell. For a moment I had a view of a world that seemed to wear
 a vast and dismal aspect of disorder, while, in truth, thanks to our
 unwearied efforts, it is as sunny an arrangement of small conveniences as
 the mind of man can conceive. But still?it was only a moment: I went
 back into my shell directly. One <i>must</i>?don't you know??though
 I seemed to have lost all my words in the chaos of dark thoughts I had
 contemplated for a second or two beyond the pale. These came back, too,
 very soon, for words also belong to the sheltering conception of light and
 order which is our refuge. I had them ready at my disposal before she
 whispered softly, "He swore he would never leave me, when we stood there
 alone! He swore to me!". . . "And it is possible that you?you! do
 not believe him?" I asked, sincerely reproachful, genuinely shocked. Why
 couldn't she believe? Wherefore this craving for incertitude, this
 clinging to fear, as if incertitude and fear had been the safeguards of
 her love. It was monstrous. She should have made for herself a shelter of
 inexpugnable peace out of that honest affection. She had not the knowledge?not
 the skill perhaps. The night had come on apace; it had grown pitch-dark
 where we were, so that without stirring she had faded like the intangible
 form of a wistful and perverse spirit. And suddenly I heard her quiet
 whisper again, "Other men had sworn the same thing." It was like a
 meditative comment on some thoughts full of sadness, of awe. And she
 added, still lower if possible, "My father did." She paused the time to
 draw an inaudible breath. "Her father too." . . . These were the things
 she knew! At once I said, "Ah! but he is not like that." This, it seemed,
 she did not intend to dispute; but after a time the strange still whisper
 wandering dreamily in the air stole into my ears. "Why is he different? Is
 he better? Is he . . ." "Upon my word of honour," I broke in, "I believe
 he is." We subdued our tones to a mysterious pitch. Amongst the huts of
 Jim's workmen (they were mostly liberated slaves from the Sherif's
 stockade) somebody started a shrill, drawling song. Across the river a big
 fire (at Doramin's, I think) made a glowing ball, completely isolated in
 the night. "Is he more true?" she murmured. "Yes," I said. "More true than
 any other man," she repeated in lingering accents. "Nobody here," I said,
 "would dream of doubting his word?nobody would dare?except
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I think she made a movement at this. "More brave," she went on in a
 changed tone. "Fear will never drive him away from you," I said a little
 nervously. The song stopped short on a shrill note, and was succeeded by
 several voices talking in the distance. Jim's voice too. I was struck by
 her silence. "What has he been telling you? He has been telling you
 something?" I asked. There was no answer. "What is it he told you?" I
 insisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Do you think I can tell you? How am I to know? How am I to understand?"
 she cried at last. There was a stir. I believe she was wringing her hands.
 "There is something he can never forget."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"So much the better for you," I said gloomily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What is it? What is it?" She put an extraordinary force of appeal into
 her supplicating tone. "He says he had been afraid. How can I believe
 this? Am I a mad woman to believe this? You all remember something! You
 all go back to it. What is it? You tell me! What is this thing? Is it
 alive??is it dead? I hate it. It is cruel. Has it got a face and a
 voice?this calamity? Will he see it?will he hear it? In his
 sleep perhaps when he cannot see me?and then arise and go. Ah! I
 shall never forgive him. My mother had forgiven?but I, never! Will
 it be a sign?a call?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was a wonderful experience. She mistrusted his very slumbers?and
 she seemed to think I could tell her why! Thus a poor mortal seduced by
 the charm of an apparition might have tried to wring from another ghost
 the tremendous secret of the claim the other world holds over a
 disembodied soul astray amongst the passions of this earth. The very
 ground on which I stood seemed to melt under my feet. And it was so simple
 too; but if the spirits evoked by our fears and our unrest have ever to
 vouch for each other's constancy before the forlorn magicians that we are,
 then I?I alone of us dwellers in the flesh?have shuddered in
 the hopeless chill of such a task. A sign, a call! How telling in its
 expression was her ignorance. A few words! How she came to know them, how
 she came to pronounce them, I can't imagine. Women find their inspiration
 in the stress of moments that for us are merely awful, absurd, or futile.
 To discover that she had a voice at all was enough to strike awe into the
 heart. Had a spurned stone cried out in pain it could not have appeared a
 greater and more pitiful miracle. These few sounds wandering in the dark
 had made their two benighted lives tragic to my mind. It was impossible to
 make her understand. I chafed silently at my impotence. And Jim, too?poor
 devil! Who would need him? Who would remember him? He had what he wanted.
 His very existence probably had been forgotten by this time. They had
 mastered their fates. They were tragic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Her immobility before me was clearly expectant, and my part was to speak
 for my brother from the realm of forgetful shade. I was deeply moved at my
 responsibility and at her distress. I would have given anything for the
 power to soothe her frail soul, tormenting itself in its invincible
 ignorance like a small bird beating about the cruel wires of a cage.
 Nothing easier than to say, Have no fear! Nothing more difficult. How does
 one kill fear, I wonder? How do you shoot a spectre through the heart,
 slash off its spectral head, take it by its spectral throat? It is an
 enterprise you rush into while you dream, and are glad to make your escape
 with wet hair and every limb shaking. The bullet is not run, the blade not
 forged, the man not born; even the winged words of truth drop at your feet
 like lumps of lead. You require for such a desperate encounter an
 enchanted and poisoned shaft dipped in a lie too subtle to be found on
 earth. An enterprise for a dream, my masters!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I began my exorcism with a heavy heart, with a sort of sullen anger in it
 too. Jim's voice, suddenly raised with a stern intonation, carried across
 the courtyard, reproving the carelessness of some dumb sinner by the
 river-side. Nothing?I said, speaking in a distinct murmur?there
 could be nothing, in that unknown world she fancied so eager to rob her of
 her happiness, there was nothing, neither living nor dead, there was no
 face, no voice, no power, that could tear Jim from her side. I drew breath
 and she whispered softly, "He told me so." "He told you the truth," I
 said. "Nothing," she sighed out, and abruptly turned upon me with a barely
 audible intensity of tone: "Why did you come to us from out there? He
 speaks of you too often. You make me afraid. Do you?do you want
 him?" A sort of stealthy fierceness had crept into our hurried mutters. "I
 shall never come again," I said bitterly. "And I don't want him. No one
 wants him." "No one," she repeated in a tone of doubt. "No one," I
 affirmed, feeling myself swayed by some strange excitement. "You think him
 strong, wise, courageous, great?why not believe him to be true too?
 I shall go to-morrow?and that is the end. You shall never be
 troubled by a voice from there again. This world you don't know is too big
 to miss him. You understand? Too big. You've got his heart in your hand.
 You must feel that. You must know that." "Yes, I know that," she breathed
 out, hard and still, as a statue might whisper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I felt I had done nothing. And what is it that I had wished to do? I am
 not sure now. At the time I was animated by an inexplicable ardour, as if
 before some great and necessary task?the influence of the moment
 upon my mental and emotional state. There are in all our lives such
 moments, such influences, coming from the outside, as it were,
 irresistible, incomprehensible?as if brought about by the mysterious
 conjunctions of the planets. She owned, as I had put it to her, his heart.
 She had that and everything else?if she could only believe it. What
 I had to tell her was that in the whole world there was no one who ever
 would need his heart, his mind, his hand. It was a common fate, and yet it
 seemed an awful thing to say of any man. She listened without a word, and
 her stillness now was like the protest of an invincible unbelief. What
 need she care for the world beyond the forests? I asked. From all the
 multitudes that peopled the vastness of that unknown there would come, I
 assured her, as long as he lived, neither a call nor a sign for him.
 Never. I was carried away. Never! Never! I remember with wonder the sort
 of dogged fierceness I displayed. I had the illusion of having got the
 spectre by the throat at last. Indeed the whole real thing has left behind
 the detailed and amazing impression of a dream. Why should she fear? She
 knew him to be strong, true, wise, brave. He was all that. Certainly. He
 was more. He was great?invincible?and the world did not want
 him, it had forgotten him, it would not even know him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I stopped; the silence over Patusan was profound, and the feeble dry
 sound of a paddle striking the side of a canoe somewhere in the middle of
 the river seemed to make it infinite. "Why?" she murmured. I felt that
 sort of rage one feels during a hard tussle. The spectre was trying to
 slip out of my grasp. "Why?" she repeated louder; "tell me!" And as I
 remained confounded, she stamped with her foot like a spoilt child. "Why?
 Speak." "You want to know?" I asked in a fury. "Yes!" she cried. "Because
 he is not good enough," I said brutally. During the moment's pause I
 noticed the fire on the other shore blaze up, dilating the circle of its
 glow like an amazed stare, and contract suddenly to a red pin-point. I
 only knew how close to me she had been when I felt the clutch of her
 fingers on my forearm. Without raising her voice, she threw into it an
 infinity of scathing contempt, bitterness, and despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"This is the very thing he said. . . . You lie!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The last two words she cried at me in the native dialect. "Hear me out!"
 I entreated; she caught her breath tremulously, flung my arm away.
 "Nobody, nobody is good enough," I began with the greatest earnestness. I
 could hear the sobbing labour of her breath frightfully quickened. I hung
 my head. What was the use? Footsteps were approaching; I slipped away
 without another word. . . .'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 34
 </h2>
 <p>
 Marlow swung his legs out, got up quickly, and staggered a little, as
 though he had been set down after a rush through space. He leaned his back
 against the balustrade and faced a disordered array of long cane chairs.
 The bodies prone in them seemed startled out of their torpor by his
 movement. One or two sat up as if alarmed; here and there a cigar glowed
 yet; Marlow looked at them all with the eyes of a man returning from the
 excessive remoteness of a dream. A throat was cleared; a calm voice
 encouraged negligently, 'Well.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Nothing,' said Marlow with a slight start. 'He had told her?that's
 all. She did not believe him?nothing more. As to myself, I do not
 know whether it be just, proper, decent for me to rejoice or to be sorry.
 For my part, I cannot say what I believed?indeed I don't know to
 this day, and never shall probably. But what did the poor devil believe
 himself? Truth shall prevail?don't you know Magna est veritas el . .
 . Yes, when it gets a chance. There is a law, no doubt?and likewise
 a law regulates your luck in the throwing of dice. It is not Justice the
 servant of men, but accident, hazard, Fortune?the ally of patient
 Time?that holds an even and scrupulous balance. Both of us had said
 the very same thing. Did we both speak the truth?or one of us did?or
 neither? . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Marlow paused, crossed his arms on his breast, and in a changed tone?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She said we lied. Poor soul! Well?let's leave it to Chance, whose
 ally is Time, that cannot be hurried, and whose enemy is Death, that will
 not wait. I had retreated?a little cowed, I must own. I had tried a
 fall with fear itself and got thrown?of course. I had only succeeded
 in adding to her anguish the hint of some mysterious collusion, of an
 inexplicable and incomprehensible conspiracy to keep her for ever in the
 dark. And it had come easily, naturally, unavoidably, by his act, by her
 own act! It was as though I had been shown the working of the implacable
 destiny of which we are the victims?and the tools. It was appalling
 to think of the girl whom I had left standing there motionless; Jim's
 footsteps had a fateful sound as he tramped by, without seeing me, in his
 heavy laced boots. "What? No lights!" he said in a loud, surprised voice.
 "What are you doing in the dark?you two?" Next moment he caught
 sight of her, I suppose. "Hallo, girl!" he cried cheerily. "Hallo, boy!"
 she answered at once, with amazing pluck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This was their usual greeting to each other, and the bit of swagger she
 would put into her rather high but sweet voice was very droll, pretty, and
 childlike. It delighted Jim greatly. This was the last occasion on which I
 heard them exchange this familiar hail, and it struck a chill into my
 heart. There was the high sweet voice, the pretty effort, the swagger; but
 it all seemed to die out prematurely, and the playful call sounded like a
 moan. It was too confoundedly awful. "What have you done with Marlow?" Jim
 was asking; and then, "Gone down?has he? Funny I didn't meet him. .
 . . You there, Marlow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I didn't answer. I wasn't going in?not yet at any rate. I really
 couldn't. While he was calling me I was engaged in making my escape
 through a little gate leading out upon a stretch of newly cleared ground.
 No; I couldn't face them yet. I walked hastily with lowered head along a
 trodden path. The ground rose gently, the few big trees had been felled,
 the undergrowth had been cut down and the grass fired. He had a mind to
 try a coffee-plantation there. The big hill, rearing its double summit
 coal-black in the clear yellow glow of the rising moon, seemed to cast its
 shadow upon the ground prepared for that experiment. He was going to try
 ever so many experiments; I had admired his energy, his enterprise, and
 his shrewdness. Nothing on earth seemed less real now than his plans, his
 energy, and his enthusiasm; and raising my eyes, I saw part of the moon
 glittering through the bushes at the bottom of the chasm. For a moment it
 looked as though the smooth disc, falling from its place in the sky upon
 the earth, had rolled to the bottom of that precipice: its ascending
 movement was like a leisurely rebound; it disengaged itself from the
 tangle of twigs; the bare contorted limb of some tree, growing on the
 slope, made a black crack right across its face. It threw its level rays
 afar as if from a cavern, and in this mournful eclipse-like light the
 stumps of felled trees uprose very dark, the heavy shadows fell at my feet
 on all sides, my own moving shadow, and across my path the shadow of the
 solitary grave perpetually garlanded with flowers. In the darkened
 moonlight the interlaced blossoms took on shapes foreign to one's memory
 and colours indefinable to the eye, as though they had been special
 flowers gathered by no man, grown not in this world, and destined for the
 use of the dead alone. Their powerful scent hung in the warm air, making
 it thick and heavy like the fumes of incense. The lumps of white coral
 shone round the dark mound like a chaplet of bleached skulls, and
 everything around was so quiet that when I stood still all sound and all
 movement in the world seemed to come to an end.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was a great peace, as if the earth had been one grave, and for a time
 I stood there thinking mostly of the living who, buried in remote places
 out of the knowledge of mankind, still are fated to share in its tragic or
 grotesque miseries. In its noble struggles too?who knows? The human
 heart is vast enough to contain all the world. It is valiant enough to
 bear the burden, but where is the courage that would cast it off?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I suppose I must have fallen into a sentimental mood; I only know that I
 stood there long enough for the sense of utter solitude to get hold of me
 so completely that all I had lately seen, all I had heard, and the very
 human speech itself, seemed to have passed away out of existence, living
 only for a while longer in my memory, as though I had been the last of
 mankind. It was a strange and melancholy illusion, evolved
 half-consciously like all our illusions, which I suspect only to be
 visions of remote unattainable truth, seen dimly. This was, indeed, one of
 the lost, forgotten, unknown places of the earth; I had looked under its
 obscure surface; and I felt that when to-morrow I had left it for ever, it
 would slip out of existence, to live only in my memory till I myself
 passed into oblivion. I have that feeling about me now; perhaps it is that
 feeling which has incited me to tell you the story, to try to hand over to
 you, as it were, its very existence, its reality?the truth disclosed
 in a moment of illusion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Cornelius broke upon it. He bolted out, vermin-like, from the long grass
 growing in a depression of the ground. I believe his house was rotting
 somewhere near by, though I've never seen it, not having been far enough
 in that direction. He ran towards me upon the path; his feet, shod in
 dirty white shoes, twinkled on the dark earth; he pulled himself up, and
 began to whine and cringe under a tall stove-pipe hat. His dried-up little
 carcass was swallowed up, totally lost, in a suit of black broadcloth.
 That was his costume for holidays and ceremonies, and it reminded me that
 this was the fourth Sunday I had spent in Patusan. All the time of my stay
 I had been vaguely aware of his desire to confide in me, if he only could
 get me all to himself. He hung about with an eager craving look on his
 sour yellow little face; but his timidity had kept him back as much as my
 natural reluctance to have anything to do with such an unsavoury creature.
 He would have succeeded, nevertheless, had he not been so ready to slink
 off as soon as you looked at him. He would slink off before Jim's severe
 gaze, before my own, which I tried to make indifferent, even before Tamb'
 Itam's surly, superior glance. He was perpetually slinking away; whenever
 seen he was seen moving off deviously, his face over his shoulder, with
 either a mistrustful snarl or a woe-begone, piteous, mute aspect; but no
 assumed expression could conceal this innate irremediable abjectness of
 his nature, any more than an arrangement of clothing can conceal some
 monstrous deformity of the body.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I don't know whether it was the demoralisation of my utter defeat in my
 encounter with a spectre of fear less than an hour ago, but I let him
 capture me without even a show of resistance. I was doomed to be the
 recipient of confidences, and to be confronted with unanswerable
 questions. It was trying; but the contempt, the unreasoned contempt, the
 man's appearance provoked, made it easier to bear. He couldn't possibly
 matter. Nothing mattered, since I had made up my mind that Jim, for whom
 alone I cared, had at last mastered his fate. He had told me he was
 satisfied . . . nearly. This is going further than most of us dare. I?who
 have the right to think myself good enough?dare not. Neither does
 any of you here, I suppose? . . .'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Marlow paused, as if expecting an answer. Nobody spoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Quite right,' he began again. 'Let no soul know, since the truth can be
 wrung out of us only by some cruel, little, awful catastrophe. But he is
 one of us, and he could say he was satisfied . . . nearly. Just fancy
 this! Nearly satisfied. One could almost envy him his catastrophe. Nearly
 satisfied. After this nothing could matter. It did not matter who
 suspected him, who trusted him, who loved him, who hated him?especially
 as it was Cornelius who hated him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Yet after all this was a kind of recognition. You shall judge of a man by
 his foes as well as by his friends, and this enemy of Jim was such as no
 decent man would be ashamed to own, without, however, making too much of
 him. This was the view Jim took, and in which I shared; but Jim
 disregarded him on general grounds. "My dear Marlow," he said, "I feel
 that if I go straight nothing can touch me. Indeed I do. Now you have been
 long enough here to have a good look round?and, frankly, don't you
 think I am pretty safe? It all depends upon me, and, by Jove! I have lots
 of confidence in myself. The worst thing he could do would be to kill me,
 I suppose. I don't think for a moment he would. He couldn't, you know?not
 if I were myself to hand him a loaded rifle for the purpose, and then turn
 my back on him. That's the sort of thing he is. And suppose he would?suppose
 he could? Well?what of that? I didn't come here flying for my life?did
 I? I came here to set my back against the wall, and I am going to stay
 here . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Till you are <i>quite</i> satisfied," I struck in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'We were sitting at the time under the roof in the stern of his boat;
 twenty paddles flashed like one, ten on a side, striking the water with a
 single splash, while behind our backs Tamb' Itam dipped silently right and
 left, and stared right down the river, attentive to keep the long canoe in
 the greatest strength of the current. Jim bowed his head, and our last
 talk seemed to flicker out for good. He was seeing me off as far as the
 mouth of the river. The schooner had left the day before, working down and
 drifting on the ebb, while I had prolonged my stay overnight. And now he
 was seeing me off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim had been a little angry with me for mentioning Cornelius at all. I
 had not, in truth, said much. The man was too insignificant to be
 dangerous, though he was as full of hate as he could hold. He had called
 me "honourable sir" at every second sentence, and had whined at my elbow
 as he followed me from the grave of his "late wife" to the gate of Jim's
 compound. He declared himself the most unhappy of men, a victim, crushed
 like a worm; he entreated me to look at him. I wouldn't turn my head to do
 so; but I could see out of the corner of my eye his obsequious shadow
 gliding after mine, while the moon, suspended on our right hand, seemed to
 gloat serenely upon the spectacle. He tried to explain?as I've told
 you?his share in the events of the memorable night. It was a matter
 of expediency. How could he know who was going to get the upper hand? "I
 would have saved him, honourable sir! I would have saved him for eighty
 dollars," he protested in dulcet tones, keeping a pace behind me. "He has
 saved himself," I said, "and he has forgiven you." I heard a sort of
 tittering, and turned upon him; at once he appeared ready to take to his
 heels. "What are you laughing at?" I asked, standing still. "Don't be
 deceived, honourable sir!" he shrieked, seemingly losing all control over
 his feelings. "<i>He</i> save himself! He knows nothing, honourable sir?nothing
 whatever. Who is he? What does he want here?the big thief? What does
 he want here? He throws dust into everybody's eyes; he throws dust into
 your eyes, honourable sir; but he can't throw dust into my eyes. He is a
 big fool, honourable sir." I laughed contemptuously, and, turning on my
 heel, began to walk on again. He ran up to my elbow and whispered
 forcibly, "He's no more than a little child here?like a little child?a
 little child." Of course I didn't take the slightest notice, and seeing
 the time pressed, because we were approaching the bamboo fence that
 glittered over the blackened ground of the clearing, he came to the point.
 He commenced by being abjectly lachrymose. His great misfortunes had
 affected his head. He hoped I would kindly forget what nothing but his
 troubles made him say. He didn't mean anything by it; only the honourable
 sir did not know what it was to be ruined, broken down, trampled upon.
 After this introduction he approached the matter near his heart, but in
 such a rambling, ejaculatory, craven fashion, that for a long time I
 couldn't make out what he was driving at. He wanted me to intercede with
 Jim in his favour. It seemed, too, to be some sort of money affair. I
 heard time and again the words, "Moderate provision?suitable
 present." He seemed to be claiming value for something, and he even went
 the length of saying with some warmth that life was not worth having if a
 man were to be robbed of everything. I did not breathe a word, of course,
 but neither did I stop my ears. The gist of the affair, which became clear
 to me gradually, was in this, that he regarded himself as entitled to some
 money in exchange for the girl. He had brought her up. Somebody else's
 child. Great trouble and pains?old man now?suitable present.
 If the honourable sir would say a word. . . . I stood still to look at him
 with curiosity, and fearful lest I should think him extortionate, I
 suppose, he hastily brought himself to make a concession. In consideration
 of a "suitable present" given at once, he would, he declared, be willing
 to undertake the charge of the girl, "without any other provision?when
 the time came for the gentleman to go home." His little yellow face, all
 crumpled as though it had been squeezed together, expressed the most
 anxious, eager avarice. His voice whined coaxingly, "No more trouble?natural
 guardian?a sum of money . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I stood there and marvelled. That kind of thing, with him, was evidently
 a vocation. I discovered suddenly in his cringing attitude a sort of
 assurance, as though he had been all his life dealing in certitudes. He
 must have thought I was dispassionately considering his proposal, because
 he became as sweet as honey. "Every gentleman made a provision when the
 time came to go home," he began insinuatingly. I slammed the little gate.
 "In this case, Mr. Cornelius," I said, "the time will never come." He took
 a few seconds to gather this in. "What!" he fairly squealed. "Why," I
 continued from my side of the gate, "haven't you heard him say so himself?
 He will never go home." "Oh! this is too much," he shouted. He would not
 address me as "honoured sir" any more. He was very still for a time, and
 then without a trace of humility began very low: "Never go?ah! He?he?he
 comes here devil knows from where?comes here?devil knows why?to
 trample on me till I die?ah?trample" (he stamped softly with
 both feet), "trample like this?nobody knows why?till I die. .
 . ." His voice became quite extinct; he was bothered by a little cough; he
 came up close to the fence and told me, dropping into a confidential and
 piteous tone, that he would not be trampled upon. "Patience?patience,"
 he muttered, striking his breast. I had done laughing at him, but
 unexpectedly he treated me to a wild cracked burst of it. "Ha! ha! ha! We
 shall see! We shall see! What! Steal from me! Steal from me everything!
 Everything! Everything!" His head drooped on one shoulder, his hands were
 hanging before him lightly clasped. One would have thought he had
 cherished the girl with surpassing love, that his spirit had been crushed
 and his heart broken by the most cruel of spoliations. Suddenly he lifted
 his head and shot out an infamous word. "Like her mother?she is like
 her deceitful mother. Exactly. In her face, too. In her face. The devil!"
 He leaned his forehead against the fence, and in that position uttered
 threats and horrible blasphemies in Portuguese in very weak ejaculations,
 mingled with miserable plaints and groans, coming out with a heave of the
 shoulders as though he had been overtaken by a deadly fit of sickness. It
 was an inexpressibly grotesque and vile performance, and I hastened away.
 He tried to shout something after me. Some disparagement of Jim, I believe?not
 too loud though, we were too near the house. All I heard distinctly was,
 "No more than a little child?a little child."'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 35
 </h2>
 <p>
 'But next morning, at the first bend of the river shutting off the houses
 of Patusan, all this dropped out of my sight bodily, with its colour, its
 design, and its meaning, like a picture created by fancy on a canvas, upon
 which, after long contemplation, you turn your back for the last time. It
 remains in the memory motionless, unfaded, with its life arrested, in an
 unchanging light. There are the ambitions, the fears, the hate, the hopes,
 and they remain in my mind just as I had seen them?intense and as if
 for ever suspended in their expression. I had turned away from the picture
 and was going back to the world where events move, men change, light
 flickers, life flows in a clear stream, no matter whether over mud or over
 stones. I wasn't going to dive into it; I would have enough to do to keep
 my head above the surface. But as to what I was leaving behind, I cannot
 imagine any alteration. The immense and magnanimous Doramin and his little
 motherly witch of a wife, gazing together upon the land and nursing
 secretly their dreams of parental ambition; Tunku Allang, wizened and
 greatly perplexed; Dain Waris, intelligent and brave, with his faith in
 Jim, with his firm glance and his ironic friendliness; the girl, absorbed
 in her frightened, suspicious adoration; Tamb' Itam, surly and faithful;
 Cornelius, leaning his forehead against the fence under the moonlight?I
 am certain of them. They exist as if under an enchanter's wand. But the
 figure round which all these are grouped?that one lives, and I am
 not certain of him. No magician's wand can immobilise him under my eyes.
 He is one of us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim, as I've told you, accompanied me on the first stage of my journey
 back to the world he had renounced, and the way at times seemed to lead
 through the very heart of untouched wilderness. The empty reaches sparkled
 under the high sun; between the high walls of vegetation the heat drowsed
 upon the water, and the boat, impelled vigorously, cut her way through the
 air that seemed to have settled dense and warm under the shelter of lofty
 trees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The shadow of the impending separation had already put an immense space
 between us, and when we spoke it was with an effort, as if to force our
 low voices across a vast and increasing distance. The boat fairly flew; we
 sweltered side by side in the stagnant superheated air; the smell of mud,
 of mush, the primeval smell of fecund earth, seemed to sting our faces;
 till suddenly at a bend it was as if a great hand far away had lifted a
 heavy curtain, had flung open un immense portal. The light itself seemed
 to stir, the sky above our heads widened, a far-off murmur reached our
 ears, a freshness enveloped us, filled our lungs, quickened our thoughts,
 our blood, our regrets?and, straight ahead, the forests sank down
 against the dark-blue ridge of the sea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I breathed deeply, I revelled in the vastness of the opened horizon, in
 the different atmosphere that seemed to vibrate with the toil of life,
 with the energy of an impeccable world. This sky and this sea were open to
 me. The girl was right?there was a sign, a call in them?something
 to which I responded with every fibre of my being. I let my eyes roam
 through space, like a man released from bonds who stretches his cramped
 limbs, runs, leaps, responds to the inspiring elation of freedom. "This is
 glorious!" I cried, and then I looked at the sinner by my side. He sat
 with his head sunk on his breast and said "Yes," without raising his eyes,
 as if afraid to see writ large on the clear sky of the offing the reproach
 of his romantic conscience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I remember the smallest details of that afternoon. We landed on a bit of
 white beach. It was backed by a low cliff wooded on the brow, draped in
 creepers to the very foot. Below us the plain of the sea, of a serene and
 intense blue, stretched with a slight upward tilt to the thread-like
 horizon drawn at the height of our eyes. Great waves of glitter blew
 lightly along the pitted dark surface, as swift as feathers chased by the
 breeze. A chain of islands sat broken and massive facing the wide estuary,
 displayed in a sheet of pale glassy water reflecting faithfully the
 contour of the shore. High in the colourless sunshine a solitary bird, all
 black, hovered, dropping and soaring above the same spot with a slight
 rocking motion of the wings. A ragged, sooty bunch of flimsy mat hovels
 was perched over its own inverted image upon a crooked multitude of high
 piles the colour of ebony. A tiny black canoe put off from amongst them
 with two tiny men, all black, who toiled exceedingly, striking down at the
 pale water: and the canoe seemed to slide painfully on a mirror. This
 bunch of miserable hovels was the fishing village that boasted of the
 white lord's especial protection, and the two men crossing over were the
 old headman and his son-in-law. They landed and walked up to us on the
 white sand, lean, dark-brown as if dried in smoke, with ashy patches on
 the skin of their naked shoulders and breasts. Their heads were bound in
 dirty but carefully folded headkerchiefs, and the old man began at once to
 state a complaint, voluble, stretching a lank arm, screwing up at Jim his
 old bleared eyes confidently. The Rajah's people would not leave them
 alone; there had been some trouble about a lot of turtles' eggs his people
 had collected on the islets there?and leaning at arm's-length upon
 his paddle, he pointed with a brown skinny hand over the sea. Jim listened
 for a time without looking up, and at last told him gently to wait. He
 would hear him by-and-by. They withdrew obediently to some little
 distance, and sat on their heels, with their paddles lying before them on
 the sand; the silvery gleams in their eyes followed our movements
 patiently; and the immensity of the outspread sea, the stillness of the
 coast, passing north and south beyond the limits of my vision, made up one
 colossal Presence watching us four dwarfs isolated on a strip of
 glistening sand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"The trouble is," remarked Jim moodily, "that for generations these
 beggars of fishermen in that village there had been considered as the
 Rajah's personal slaves?and the old rip can't get it into his head
 that . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He paused. "That you have changed all that," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Yes I've changed all that," he muttered in a gloomy voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You have had your opportunity," I pursued.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Have I?" he said. "Well, yes. I suppose so. Yes. I have got back my
 confidence in myself?a good name?yet sometimes I wish . . .
 No! I shall hold what I've got. Can't expect anything more." He flung his
 arm out towards the sea. "Not out there anyhow." He stamped his foot upon
 the sand. "This is my limit, because nothing less will do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'We continued pacing the beach. "Yes, I've changed all that," he went on,
 with a sidelong glance at the two patient squatting fishermen; "but only
 try to think what it would be if I went away. Jove! can't you see it? Hell
 loose. No! To-morrow I shall go and take my chance of drinking that silly
 old Tunku Allang's coffee, and I shall make no end of fuss over these
 rotten turtles' eggs. No. I can't say?enough. Never. I must go on,
 go on for ever holding up my end, to feel sure that nothing can touch me.
 I must stick to their belief in me to feel safe and to?to" . . . He
 cast about for a word, seemed to look for it on the sea . . . "to keep in
 touch with" . . . His voice sank suddenly to a murmur . . . "with those
 whom, perhaps, I shall never see any more. With?with?you, for
 instance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I was profoundly humbled by his words. "For God's sake," I said, "don't
 set me up, my dear fellow; just look to yourself." I felt a gratitude, an
 affection, for that straggler whose eyes had singled me out, keeping my
 place in the ranks of an insignificant multitude. How little that was to
 boast of, after all! I turned my burning face away; under the low sun,
 glowing, darkened and crimson, like un ember snatched from the fire, the
 sea lay outspread, offering all its immense stillness to the approach of
 the fiery orb. Twice he was going to speak, but checked himself; at last,
 as if he had found a formula?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I shall be faithful," he said quietly. "I shall be faithful," he
 repeated, without looking at me, but for the first time letting his eyes
 wander upon the waters, whose blueness had changed to a gloomy purple
 under the fires of sunset. Ah! he was romantic, romantic. I recalled some
 words of Stein's. . . . "In the destructive element immerse! . . . To
 follow the dream, and again to follow the dream?and so?always?usque
 ad finem . . ." He was romantic, but none the less true. Who could tell
 what forms, what visions, what faces, what forgiveness he could see in the
 glow of the west! . . . A small boat, leaving the schooner, moved slowly,
 with a regular beat of two oars, towards the sandbank to take me off. "And
 then there's Jewel," he said, out of the great silence of earth, sky, and
 sea, which had mastered my very thoughts so that his voice made me start.
 "There's Jewel." "Yes," I murmured. "I need not tell you what she is to
 me," he pursued. "You've seen. In time she will come to understand . . ."
 "I hope so," I interrupted. "She trusts me, too," he mused, and then
 changed his tone. "When shall we meet next, I wonder?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Never?unless you come out," I answered, avoiding his glance. He
 didn't seem to be surprised; he kept very quiet for a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Good-bye, then," he said, after a pause. "Perhaps it's just as well."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'We shook hands, and I walked to the boat, which waited with her nose on
 the beach. The schooner, her mainsail set and jib-sheet to windward,
 curveted on the purple sea; there was a rosy tinge on her sails. "Will you
 be going home again soon?" asked Jim, just as I swung my leg over the
 gunwale. "In a year or so if I live," I said. The forefoot grated on the
 sand, the boat floated, the wet oars flashed and dipped once, twice. Jim,
 at the water's edge, raised his voice. "Tell them . . ." he began. I
 signed to the men to cease rowing, and waited in wonder. Tell who? The
 half-submerged sun faced him; I could see its red gleam in his eyes that
 looked dumbly at me. . . . "No?nothing," he said, and with a slight
 wave of his hand motioned the boat away. I did not look again at the shore
 till I had clambered on board the schooner.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'By that time the sun had set. The twilight lay over the east, and the
 coast, turned black, extended infinitely its sombre wall that seemed the
 very stronghold of the night; the western horizon was one great blaze of
 gold and crimson in which a big detached cloud floated dark and still,
 casting a slaty shadow on the water beneath, and I saw Jim on the beach
 watching the schooner fall off and gather headway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The two half-naked fishermen had arisen as soon as I had gone; they were
 no doubt pouring the plaint of their trifling, miserable, oppressed lives
 into the ears of the white lord, and no doubt he was listening to it,
 making it his own, for was it not a part of his luck?the luck "from
 the word Go"?the luck to which he had assured me he was so
 completely equal? They, too, I should think, were in luck, and I was sure
 their pertinacity would be equal to it. Their dark-skinned bodies vanished
 on the dark background long before I had lost sight of their protector. He
 was white from head to foot, and remained persistently visible with the
 stronghold of the night at his back, the sea at his feet, the opportunity
 by his side?still veiled. What do you say? Was it still veiled? I
 don't know. For me that white figure in the stillness of coast and sea
 seemed to stand at the heart of a vast enigma. The twilight was ebbing
 fast from the sky above his head, the strip of sand had sunk already under
 his feet, he himself appeared no bigger than a child?then only a
 speck, a tiny white speck, that seemed to catch all the light left in a
 darkened world. . . . And, suddenly, I lost him. . . .

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 36
 </h2>
 <p>
 With these words Marlow had ended his narrative, and his audience had
 broken up forthwith, under his abstract, pensive gaze. Men drifted off the
 verandah in pairs or alone without loss of time, without offering a
 remark, as if the last image of that incomplete story, its incompleteness
 itself, and the very tone of the speaker, had made discussion in vain and
 comment impossible. Each of them seemed to carry away his own impression,
 to carry it away with him like a secret; but there was only one man of all
 these listeners who was ever to hear the last word of the story. It came
 to him at home, more than two years later, and it came contained in a
 thick packet addressed in Marlow's upright and angular handwriting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The privileged man opened the packet, looked in, then, laying it down,
 went to the window. His rooms were in the highest flat of a lofty
 building, and his glance could travel afar beyond the clear panes of
 glass, as though he were looking out of the lantern of a lighthouse. The
 slopes of the roofs glistened, the dark broken ridges succeeded each other
 without end like sombre, uncrested waves, and from the depths of the town
 under his feet ascended a confused and unceasing mutter. The spires of
 churches, numerous, scattered haphazard, uprose like beacons on a maze of
 shoals without a channel; the driving rain mingled with the falling dusk
 of a winter's evening; and the booming of a big clock on a tower, striking
 the hour, rolled past in voluminous, austere bursts of sound, with a
 shrill vibrating cry at the core. He drew the heavy curtains.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The light of his shaded reading-lamp slept like a sheltered pool, his
 footfalls made no sound on the carpet, his wandering days were over. No
 more horizons as boundless as hope, no more twilights within the forests
 as solemn as temples, in the hot quest for the Ever-undiscovered Country
 over the hill, across the stream, beyond the wave. The hour was striking!
 No more! No more!?but the opened packet under the lamp brought back
 the sounds, the visions, the very savour of the past?a multitude of
 fading faces, a tumult of low voices, dying away upon the shores of
 distant seas under a passionate and unconsoling sunshine. He sighed and
 sat down to read.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first he saw three distinct enclosures. A good many pages closely
 blackened and pinned together; a loose square sheet of greyish paper with
 a few words traced in a handwriting he had never seen before, and an
 explanatory letter from Marlow. From this last fell another letter,
 yellowed by time and frayed on the folds. He picked it up and, laying it
 aside, turned to Marlow's message, ran swiftly over the opening lines,
 and, checking himself, thereafter read on deliberately, like one
 approaching with slow feet and alert eyes the glimpse of an undiscovered
 country.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '. . . I don't suppose you've forgotten,' went on the letter. 'You alone
 have showed an interest in him that survived the telling of his story,
 though I remember well you would not admit he had mastered his fate. You
 prophesied for him the disaster of weariness and of disgust with acquired
 honour, with the self-appointed task, with the love sprung from pity and
 youth. You had said you knew so well "that kind of thing," its illusory
 satisfaction, its unavoidable deception. You said also?I call to
 mind?that "giving your life up to them" (them meaning all of mankind
 with skins brown, yellow, or black in colour) "was like selling your soul
 to a brute." You contended that "that kind of thing" was only endurable
 and enduring when based on a firm conviction in the truth of ideas
 racially our own, in whose name are established the order, the morality of
 an ethical progress. "We want its strength at our backs," you had said.
 "We want a belief in its necessity and its justice, to make a worthy and
 conscious sacrifice of our lives. Without it the sacrifice is only
 forgetfulness, the way of offering is no better than the way to
 perdition." In other words, you maintained that we must fight in the ranks
 or our lives don't count. Possibly! You ought to know?be it said
 without malice?you who have rushed into one or two places
 single-handed and came out cleverly, without singeing your wings. The
 point, however, is that of all mankind Jim had no dealings but with
 himself, and the question is whether at the last he had not confessed to a
 faith mightier than the laws of order and progress.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I affirm nothing. Perhaps you may pronounce?after you've read.
 There is much truth?after all?in the common expression "under
 a cloud." It is impossible to see him clearly?especially as it is
 through the eyes of others that we take our last look at him. I have no
 hesitation in imparting to you all I know of the last episode that, as he
 used to say, had "come to him." One wonders whether this was perhaps that
 supreme opportunity, that last and satisfying test for which I had always
 suspected him to be waiting, before he could frame a message to the
 impeccable world. You remember that when I was leaving him for the last
 time he had asked whether I would be going home soon, and suddenly cried
 after me, "Tell them . . ." I had waited?curious I'll own, and
 hopeful too?only to hear him shout, "No?nothing." That was all
 then?and there will be nothing more; there will be no message,
 unless such as each of us can interpret for himself from the language of
 facts, that are so often more enigmatic than the craftiest arrangement of
 words. He made, it is true, one more attempt to deliver himself; but that
 too failed, as you may perceive if you look at the sheet of greyish
 foolscap enclosed here. He had tried to write; do you notice the
 commonplace hand? It is headed "The Fort, Patusan." I suppose he had
 carried out his intention of making out of his house a place of defence.
 It was an excellent plan: a deep ditch, an earth wall topped by a
 palisade, and at the angles guns mounted on platforms to sweep each side
 of the square. Doramin had agreed to furnish him the guns; and so each man
 of his party would know there was a place of safety, upon which every
 faithful partisan could rally in case of some sudden danger. All this
 showed his judicious foresight, his faith in the future. What he called
 "my own people"?the liberated captives of the Sherif?were to
 make a distinct quarter of Patusan, with their huts and little plots of
 ground under the walls of the stronghold. Within he would be an invincible
 host in himself "The Fort, Patusan." No date, as you observe. What is a
 number and a name to a day of days? It is also impossible to say whom he
 had in his mind when he seized the pen: Stein?myself?the world
 at large?or was this only the aimless startled cry of a solitary man
 confronted by his fate? "An awful thing has happened," he wrote before he
 flung the pen down for the first time; look at the ink blot resembling the
 head of an arrow under these words. After a while he had tried again,
 scrawling heavily, as if with a hand of lead, another line. "I must now at
 once . . ." The pen had spluttered, and that time he gave it up. There's
 nothing more; he had seen a broad gulf that neither eye nor voice could
 span. I can understand this. He was overwhelmed by the inexplicable; he
 was overwhelmed by his own personality?the gift of that destiny
 which he had done his best to master.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I send you also an old letter?a very old letter. It was found
 carefully preserved in his writing-case. It is from his father, and by the
 date you can see he must have received it a few days before he joined the
 Patna. Thus it must be the last letter he ever had from home. He had
 treasured it all these years. The good old parson fancied his sailor son.
 I've looked in at a sentence here and there. There is nothing in it except
 just affection. He tells his "dear James" that the last long letter from
 him was very "honest and entertaining." He would not have him "judge men
 harshly or hastily." There are four pages of it, easy morality and family
 news. Tom had "taken orders." Carrie's husband had "money losses." The old
 chap goes on equably trusting Providence and the established order of the
 universe, but alive to its small dangers and its small mercies. One can
 almost see him, grey-haired and serene in the inviolable shelter of his
 book-lined, faded, and comfortable study, where for forty years he had
 conscientiously gone over and over again the round of his little thoughts
 about faith and virtue, about the conduct of life and the only proper
 manner of dying; where he had written so many sermons, where he sits
 talking to his boy, over there, on the other side of the earth. But what
 of the distance? Virtue is one all over the world, and there is only one
 faith, one conceivable conduct of life, one manner of dying. He hopes his
 "dear James" will never forget that "who once gives way to temptation, in
 the very instant hazards his total depravity and everlasting ruin.
 Therefore resolve fixedly never, through any possible motives, to do
 anything which you believe to be wrong." There is also some news of a
 favourite dog; and a pony, "which all you boys used to ride," had gone
 blind from old age and had to be shot. The old chap invokes Heaven's
 blessing; the mother and all the girls then at home send their love. . . .
 No, there is nothing much in that yellow frayed letter fluttering out of
 his cherishing grasp after so many years. It was never answered, but who
 can say what converse he may have held with all these placid, colourless
 forms of men and women peopling that quiet corner of the world as free of
 danger or strife as a tomb, and breathing equably the air of undisturbed
 rectitude. It seems amazing that he should belong to it, he to whom so
 many things "had come." Nothing ever came to them; they would never be
 taken unawares, and never be called upon to grapple with fate. Here they
 all are, evoked by the mild gossip of the father, all these brothers and
 sisters, bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, gazing with clear
 unconscious eyes, while I seem to see him, returned at last, no longer a
 mere white speck at the heart of an immense mystery, but of full stature,
 standing disregarded amongst their untroubled shapes, with a stern and
 romantic aspect, but always mute, dark?under a cloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The story of the last events you will find in the few pages enclosed
 here. You must admit that it is romantic beyond the wildest dreams of his
 boyhood, and yet there is to my mind a sort of profound and terrifying
 logic in it, as if it were our imagination alone that could set loose upon
 us the might of an overwhelming destiny. The imprudence of our thoughts
 recoils upon our heads; who toys with the sword shall perish by the sword.
 This astounding adventure, of which the most astounding part is that it is
 true, comes on as an unavoidable consequence. Something of the sort had to
 happen. You repeat this to yourself while you marvel that such a thing
 could happen in the year of grace before last. But it has happened?and
 there is no disputing its logic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I put it down here for you as though I had been an eyewitness. My
 information was fragmentary, but I've fitted the pieces together, and
 there is enough of them to make an intelligible picture. I wonder how he
 would have related it himself. He has confided so much in me that at times
 it seems as though he must come in presently and tell the story in his own
 words, in his careless yet feeling voice, with his offhand manner, a
 little puzzled, a little bothered, a little hurt, but now and then by a
 word or a phrase giving one of these glimpses of his very own self that
 were never any good for purposes of orientation. It's difficult to believe
 he will never come. I shall never hear his voice again, nor shall I see
 his smooth tan-and-pink face with a white line on the forehead, and the
 youthful eyes darkened by excitement to a profound, unfathomable blue.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 37
 </h2>
 <p>
 'It all begins with a remarkable exploit of a man called Brown, who stole
 with complete success a Spanish schooner out of a small bay near
 Zamboanga. Till I discovered the fellow my information was incomplete, but
 most unexpectedly I did come upon him a few hours before he gave up his
 arrogant ghost. Fortunately he was willing and able to talk between the
 choking fits of asthma, and his racked body writhed with malicious
 exultation at the bare thought of Jim. He exulted thus at the idea that he
 had "paid out the stuck-up beggar after all." He gloated over his action.
 I had to bear the sunken glare of his fierce crow-footed eyes if I wanted
 to know; and so I bore it, reflecting how much certain forms of evil are
 akin to madness, derived from intense egoism, inflamed by resistance,
 tearing the soul to pieces, and giving factitious vigour to the body. The
 story also reveals unsuspected depths of cunning in the wretched
 Cornelius, whose abject and intense hate acts like a subtle inspiration,
 pointing out an unerring way towards revenge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"I could see directly I set my eyes on him what sort of a fool he was,"
 gasped the dying Brown. "He a man! Hell! He was a hollow sham. As if he
 couldn't have said straight out, 'Hands off my plunder!' blast him! That
 would have been like a man! Rot his superior soul! He had me there?but
 he hadn't devil enough in him to make an end of me. Not he! A thing like
 that letting me off as if I wasn't worth a kick! . . ." Brown struggled
 desperately for breath. . . . "Fraud. . . . Letting me off. . . . And so I
 did make an end of him after all. . . ." He choked again. . . . "I expect
 this thing'll kill me, but I shall die easy now. You . . . you here . . .
 I don't know your name?I would give you a five-pound note if?if
 I had it?for the news?or my name's not Brown. . . ." He
 grinned horribly. . . . "Gentleman Brown."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He said all these things in profound gasps, staring at me with his yellow
 eyes out of a long, ravaged, brown face; he jerked his left arm; a
 pepper-and-salt matted beard hung almost into his lap; a dirty ragged
 blanket covered his legs. I had found him out in Bankok through that
 busybody Schomberg, the hotel-keeper, who had, confidentially, directed me
 where to look. It appears that a sort of loafing, fuddled vagabond?a
 white man living amongst the natives with a Siamese woman?had
 considered it a great privilege to give a shelter to the last days of the
 famous Gentleman Brown. While he was talking to me in the wretched hovel,
 and, as it were, fighting for every minute of his life, the Siamese woman,
 with big bare legs and a stupid coarse face, sat in a dark corner chewing
 betel stolidly. Now and then she would get up for the purpose of shooing a
 chicken away from the door. The whole hut shook when she walked. An ugly
 yellow child, naked and pot-bellied like a little heathen god, stood at
 the foot of the couch, finger in mouth, lost in a profound and calm
 contemplation of the dying man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He talked feverishly; but in the middle of a word, perhaps, an invisible
 hand would take him by the throat, and he would look at me dumbly with an
 expression of doubt and anguish. He seemed to fear that I would get tired
 of waiting and go away, leaving him with his tale untold, with his
 exultation unexpressed. He died during the night, I believe, but by that
 time I had nothing more to learn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'So much as to Brown, for the present.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Eight months before this, coming into Samarang, I went as usual to see
 Stein. On the garden side of the house a Malay on the verandah greeted me
 shyly, and I remembered that I had seen him in Patusan, in Jim's house,
 amongst other Bugis men who used to come in the evening to talk
 interminably over their war reminiscences and to discuss State affairs.
 Jim had pointed him out to me once as a respectable petty trader owning a
 small seagoing native craft, who had showed himself "one of the best at
 the taking of the stockade." I was not very surprised to see him, since
 any Patusan trader venturing as far as Samarang would naturally find his
 way to Stein's house. I returned his greeting and passed on. At the door
 of Stein's room I came upon another Malay in whom I recognised Tamb' Itam.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I asked him at once what he was doing there; it occurred to me that Jim
 might have come on a visit. I own I was pleased and excited at the
 thought. Tamb' Itam looked as if he did not know what to say. "Is Tuan Jim
 inside?" I asked impatiently. "No," he mumbled, hanging his head for a
 moment, and then with sudden earnestness, "He would not fight. He would
 not fight," he repeated twice. As he seemed unable to say anything else, I
 pushed him aside and went in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Stein, tall and stooping, stood alone in the middle of the room between
 the rows of butterfly cases. "Ach! is it you, my friend?" he said sadly,
 peering through his glasses. A drab sack-coat of alpaca hung, unbuttoned,
 down to his knees. He had a Panama hat on his head, and there were deep
 furrows on his pale cheeks. "What's the matter now?" I asked nervously.
 "There's Tamb' Itam there. . . ." "Come and see the girl. Come and see the
 girl. She is here," he said, with a half-hearted show of activity. I tried
 to detain him, but with gentle obstinacy he would take no notice of my
 eager questions. "She is here, she is here," he repeated, in great
 perturbation. "They came here two days ago. An old man like me, a stranger?sehen
 Sie?cannot do much. . . . Come this way. . . . Young hearts are
 unforgiving. . . ." I could see he was in utmost distress. . . . "The
 strength of life in them, the cruel strength of life. . . ." He mumbled,
 leading me round the house; I followed him, lost in dismal and angry
 conjectures. At the door of the drawing-room he barred my way. "He loved
 her very much," he said interrogatively, and I only nodded, feeling so
 bitterly disappointed that I would not trust myself to speak. "Very
 frightful," he murmured. "She can't understand me. I am only a strange old
 man. Perhaps you . . . she knows you. Talk to her. We can't leave it like
 this. Tell her to forgive him. It was very frightful." "No doubt," I said,
 exasperated at being in the dark; "but have you forgiven him?" He looked
 at me queerly. "You shall hear," he said, and opening the door, absolutely
 pushed me in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'You know Stein's big house and the two immense reception-rooms,
 uninhabited and uninhabitable, clean, full of solitude and of shining
 things that look as if never beheld by the eye of man? They are cool on
 the hottest days, and you enter them as you would a scrubbed cave
 underground. I passed through one, and in the other I saw the girl sitting
 at the end of a big mahogany table, on which she rested her head, the face
 hidden in her arms. The waxed floor reflected her dimly as though it had
 been a sheet of frozen water. The rattan screens were down, and through
 the strange greenish gloom made by the foliage of the trees outside a
 strong wind blew in gusts, swaying the long draperies of windows and
 doorways. Her white figure seemed shaped in snow; the pendent crystals of
 a great chandelier clicked above her head like glittering icicles. She
 looked up and watched my approach. I was chilled as if these vast
 apartments had been the cold abode of despair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She recognised me at once, and as soon as I had stopped, looking down at
 her: "He has left me," she said quietly; "you always leave us?for
 your own ends." Her face was set. All the heat of life seemed withdrawn
 within some inaccessible spot in her breast. "It would have been easy to
 die with him," she went on, and made a slight weary gesture as if giving
 up the incomprehensible. "He would not! It was like a blindness?and
 yet it was I who was speaking to him; it was I who stood before his eyes;
 it was at me that he looked all the time! Ah! you are hard, treacherous,
 without truth, without compassion. What makes you so wicked? Or is it that
 you are all mad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I took her hand; it did not respond, and when I dropped it, it hung down
 to the floor. That indifference, more awful than tears, cries, and
 reproaches, seemed to defy time and consolation. You felt that nothing you
 could say would reach the seat of the still and benumbing pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Stein had said, "You shall hear." I did hear. I heard it all, listening
 with amazement, with awe, to the tones of her inflexible weariness. She
 could not grasp the real sense of what she was telling me, and her
 resentment filled me with pity for her?for him too. I stood rooted
 to the spot after she had finished. Leaning on her arm, she stared with
 hard eyes, and the wind passed in gusts, the crystals kept on clicking in
 the greenish gloom. She went on whispering to herself: "And yet he was
 looking at me! He could see my face, hear my voice, hear my grief! When I
 used to sit at his feet, with my cheek against his knee and his hand on my
 head, the curse of cruelty and madness was already within him, waiting for
 the day. The day came! . . . and before the sun had set he could not see
 me any more?he was made blind and deaf and without pity, as you all
 are. He shall have no tears from me. Never, never. Not one tear. I will
 not! He went away from me as if I had been worse than death. He fled as if
 driven by some accursed thing he had heard or seen in his sleep. . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Her steady eyes seemed to strain after the shape of a man torn out of her
 arms by the strength of a dream. She made no sign to my silent bow. I was
 glad to escape.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I saw her once again, the same afternoon. On leaving her I had gone in
 search of Stein, whom I could not find indoors; and I wandered out,
 pursued by distressful thoughts, into the gardens, those famous gardens of
 Stein, in which you can find every plant and tree of tropical lowlands. I
 followed the course of the canalised stream, and sat for a long time on a
 shaded bench near the ornamental pond, where some waterfowl with clipped
 wings were diving and splashing noisily. The branches of casuarina trees
 behind me swayed lightly, incessantly, reminding me of the soughing of fir
 trees at home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This mournful and restless sound was a fit accompaniment to my
 meditations. She had said he had been driven away from her by a dream,?and
 there was no answer one could make her?there seemed to be no
 forgiveness for such a transgression. And yet is not mankind itself,
 pushing on its blind way, driven by a dream of its greatness and its power
 upon the dark paths of excessive cruelty and of excessive devotion? And
 what is the pursuit of truth, after all?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'When I rose to get back to the house I caught sight of Stein's drab coat
 through a gap in the foliage, and very soon at a turn of the path I came
 upon him walking with the girl. Her little hand rested on his forearm, and
 under the broad, flat rim of his Panama hat he bent over her, grey-haired,
 paternal, with compassionate and chivalrous deference. I stood aside, but
 they stopped, facing me. His gaze was bent on the ground at his feet; the
 girl, erect and slight on his arm, stared sombrely beyond my shoulder with
 black, clear, motionless eyes. "Schrecklich," he murmured. "Terrible!
 Terrible! What can one do?" He seemed to be appealing to me, but her
 youth, the length of the days suspended over her head, appealed to me
 more; and suddenly, even as I realised that nothing could be said, I found
 myself pleading his cause for her sake. "You must forgive him," I
 concluded, and my own voice seemed to me muffled, lost in un irresponsive
 deaf immensity. "We all want to be forgiven," I added after a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What have I done?" she asked with her lips only.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"You always mistrusted him," I said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He was like the others," she pronounced slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Not like the others," I protested, but she continued evenly, without any
 feeling?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He was false." And suddenly Stein broke in. "No! no! no! My poor child!
 . . ." He patted her hand lying passively on his sleeve. "No! no! Not
 false! True! True! True!" He tried to look into her stony face. "You don't
 understand. Ach! Why you do not understand? . . . Terrible," he said to
 me. "Some day she <i>shall</i> understand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Will you explain?" I asked, looking hard at him. They moved on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I watched them. Her gown trailed on the path, her black hair fell loose.
 She walked upright and light by the side of the tall man, whose long
 shapeless coat hung in perpendicular folds from the stooping shoulders,
 whose feet moved slowly. They disappeared beyond that spinney (you may
 remember) where sixteen different kinds of bamboo grow together, all
 distinguishable to the learned eye. For my part, I was fascinated by the
 exquisite grace and beauty of that fluted grove, crowned with pointed
 leaves and feathery heads, the lightness, the vigour, the charm as
 distinct as a voice of that unperplexed luxuriating life. I remember
 staying to look at it for a long time, as one would linger within reach of
 a consoling whisper. The sky was pearly grey. It was one of those overcast
 days so rare in the tropics, in which memories crowd upon one, memories of
 other shores, of other faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I drove back to town the same afternoon, taking with me Tamb' Itam and
 the other Malay, in whose seagoing craft they had escaped in the
 bewilderment, fear, and gloom of the disaster. The shock of it seemed to
 have changed their natures. It had turned her passion into stone, and it
 made the surly taciturn Tamb' Itam almost loquacious. His surliness, too,
 was subdued into puzzled humility, as though he had seen the failure of a
 potent charm in a supreme moment. The Bugis trader, a shy hesitating man,
 was very clear in the little he had to say. Both were evidently over-awed
 by a sense of deep inexpressible wonder, by the touch of an inscrutable
 mystery.'
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There with Marlow's signature the letter proper ended. The privileged
 reader screwed up his lamp, and solitary above the billowy roofs of the
 town, like a lighthouse-keeper above the sea, he turned to the pages of
 the story.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 38
 </h2>
 <p>
 'It all begins, as I've told you, with the man called Brown,' ran the
 opening sentence of Marlow's narrative. 'You who have knocked about the
 Western Pacific must have heard of him. He was the show ruffian on the
 Australian coast?not that he was often to be seen there, but because
 he was always trotted out in the stories of lawless life a visitor from
 home is treated to; and the mildest of these stories which were told about
 him from Cape York to Eden Bay was more than enough to hang a man if told
 in the right place. They never failed to let you know, too, that he was
 supposed to be the son of a baronet. Be it as it may, it is certain he had
 deserted from a home ship in the early gold-digging days, and in a few
 years became talked about as the terror of this or that group of islands
 in Polynesia. He would kidnap natives, he would strip some lonely white
 trader to the very pyjamas he stood in, and after he had robbed the poor
 devil, he would as likely as not invite him to fight a duel with shot-guns
 on the beach?which would have been fair enough as these things go,
 if the other man hadn't been by that time already half-dead with fright.
 Brown was a latter-day buccaneer, sorry enough, like his more celebrated
 prototypes; but what distinguished him from his contemporary brother
 ruffians, like Bully Hayes or the mellifluous Pease, or that perfumed,
 Dundreary-whiskered, dandified scoundrel known as Dirty Dick, was the
 arrogant temper of his misdeeds and a vehement scorn for mankind at large
 and for his victims in particular. The others were merely vulgar and
 greedy brutes, but he seemed moved by some complex intention. He would rob
 a man as if only to demonstrate his poor opinion of the creature, and he
 would bring to the shooting or maiming of some quiet, unoffending stranger
 a savage and vengeful earnestness fit to terrify the most reckless of
 desperadoes. In the days of his greatest glory he owned an armed barque,
 manned by a mixed crew of Kanakas and runaway whalers, and boasted, I
 don't know with what truth, of being financed on the quiet by a most
 respectable firm of copra merchants. Later on he ran off?it was
 reported?with the wife of a missionary, a very young girl from
 Clapham way, who had married the mild, flat-footed fellow in a moment of
 enthusiasm, and, suddenly transplanted to Melanesia, lost her bearings
 somehow. It was a dark story. She was ill at the time he carried her off,
 and died on board his ship. It is said?as the most wonderful put of
 the tale?that over her body he gave way to an outburst of sombre and
 violent grief. His luck left him, too, very soon after. He lost his ship
 on some rocks off Malaita, and disappeared for a time as though he had
 gone down with her. He is heard of next at Nuka-Hiva, where he bought an
 old French schooner out of Government service. What creditable enterprise
 he might have had in view when he made that purchase I can't say, but it
 is evident that what with High Commissioners, consuls, men-of-war, and
 international control, the South Seas were getting too hot to hold
 gentlemen of his kidney. Clearly he must have shifted the scene of his
 operations farther west, because a year later he plays an incredibly
 audacious, but not a very profitable part, in a serio-comic business in
 Manila Bay, in which a peculating governor and an absconding treasurer are
 the principal figures; thereafter he seems to have hung around the
 Philippines in his rotten schooner battling with un adverse fortune, till
 at last, running his appointed course, he sails into Jim's history, a
 blind accomplice of the Dark Powers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His tale goes that when a Spanish patrol cutter captured him he was
 simply trying to run a few guns for the insurgents. If so, then I can't
 understand what he was doing off the south coast of Mindanao. My belief,
 however, is that he was blackmailing the native villages along the coast.
 The principal thing is that the cutter, throwing a guard on board, made
 him sail in company towards Zamboanga. On the way, for some reason or
 other, both vessels had to call at one of these new Spanish settlements?which
 never came to anything in the end?where there was not only a civil
 official in charge on shore, but a good stout coasting schooner lying at
 anchor in the little bay; and this craft, in every way much better than
 his own, Brown made up his mind to steal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He was down on his luck?as he told me himself. The world he had
 bullied for twenty years with fierce, aggressive disdain, had yielded him
 nothing in the way of material advantage except a small bag of silver
 dollars, which was concealed in his cabin so that "the devil himself
 couldn't smell it out." And that was all?absolutely all. He was
 tired of his life, and not afraid of death. But this man, who would stake
 his existence on a whim with a bitter and jeering recklessness, stood in
 mortal fear of imprisonment. He had an unreasoning cold-sweat,
 nerve-shaking, blood-to-water-turning sort of horror at the bare
 possibility of being locked up?the sort of terror a superstitious
 man would feel at the thought of being embraced by a spectre. Therefore
 the civil official who came on board to make a preliminary investigation
 into the capture, investigated arduously all day long, and only went
 ashore after dark, muffled up in a cloak, and taking great care not to let
 Brown's little all clink in its bag. Afterwards, being a man of his word,
 he contrived (the very next evening, I believe) to send off the Government
 cutter on some urgent bit of special service. As her commander could not
 spare a prize crew, he contented himself by taking away before he left all
 the sails of Brown's schooner to the very last rag, and took good care to
 tow his two boats on to the beach a couple of miles off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But in Brown's crew there was a Solomon Islander, kidnapped in his youth
 and devoted to Brown, who was the best man of the whole gang. That fellow
 swam off to the coaster?five hundred yards or so?with the end
 of a warp made up of all the running gear unrove for the purpose. The
 water was smooth, and the bay dark, "like the inside of a cow," as Brown
 described it. The Solomon Islander clambered over the bulwarks with the
 end of the rope in his teeth. The crew of the coaster?all Tagals?were
 ashore having a jollification in the native village. The two shipkeepers
 left on board woke up suddenly and saw the devil. It had glittering eyes
 and leaped quick as lightning about the deck. They fell on their knees,
 paralysed with fear, crossing themselves and mumbling prayers. With a long
 knife he found in the caboose the Solomon Islander, without interrupting
 their orisons, stabbed first one, then the other; with the same knife he
 set to sawing patiently at the coir cable till suddenly it parted under
 the blade with a splash. Then in the silence of the bay he let out a
 cautious shout, and Brown's gang, who meantime had been peering and
 straining their hopeful ears in the darkness, began to pull gently at
 their end of the warp. In less than five minutes the two schooners came
 together with a slight shock and a creak of spars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Brown's crowd transferred themselves without losing an instant, taking
 with them their firearms and a large supply of ammunition. They were
 sixteen in all: two runaway blue-jackets, a lanky deserter from a Yankee
 man-of-war, a couple of simple, blond Scandinavians, a mulatto of sorts,
 one bland Chinaman who cooked?and the rest of the nondescript spawn
 of the South Seas. None of them cared; Brown bent them to his will, and
 Brown, indifferent to gallows, was running away from the spectre of a
 Spanish prison. He didn't give them the time to trans-ship enough
 provisions; the weather was calm, the air was charged with dew, and when
 they cast off the ropes and set sail to a faint off-shore draught there
 was no flutter in the damp canvas; their old schooner seemed to detach
 itself gently from the stolen craft and slip away silently, together with
 the black mass of the coast, into the night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'They got clear away. Brown related to me in detail their passage down the
 Straits of Macassar. It is a harrowing and desperate story. They were
 short of food and water; they boarded several native craft and got a
 little from each. With a stolen ship Brown did not dare to put into any
 port, of course. He had no money to buy anything, no papers to show, and
 no lie plausible enough to get him out again. An Arab barque, under the
 Dutch flag, surprised one night at anchor off Poulo Laut, yielded a little
 dirty rice, a bunch of bananas, and a cask of water; three days of
 squally, misty weather from the north-east shot the schooner across the
 Java Sea. The yellow muddy waves drenched that collection of hungry
 ruffians. They sighted mail-boats moving on their appointed routes; passed
 well-found home ships with rusty iron sides anchored in the shallow sea
 waiting for a change of weather or the turn of the tide; an English
 gunboat, white and trim, with two slim masts, crossed their bows one day
 in the distance; and on another occasion a Dutch corvette, black and
 heavily sparred, loomed up on their quarter, steaming dead slow in the
 mist. They slipped through unseen or disregarded, a wan, sallow-faced band
 of utter outcasts, enraged with hunger and hunted by fear. Brown's idea
 was to make for Madagascar, where he expected, on grounds not altogether
 illusory, to sell the schooner in Tamatave, and no questions asked, or
 perhaps obtain some more or less forged papers for her. Yet before he
 could face the long passage across the Indian Ocean food was wanted?water
 too.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Perhaps he had heard of Patusan?or perhaps he just only happened to
 see the name written in small letters on the chart?probably that of
 a largish village up a river in a native state, perfectly defenceless, far
 from the beaten tracks of the sea and from the ends of submarine cables.
 He had done that kind of thing before?in the way of business; and
 this now was an absolute necessity, a question of life and death?or
 rather of liberty. Of liberty! He was sure to get provisions?bullocks?rice?sweet-potatoes.
 The sorry gang licked their chops. A cargo of produce for the schooner
 perhaps could be extorted?and, who knows??some real ringing
 coined money! Some of these chiefs and village headmen can be made to part
 freely. He told me he would have roasted their toes rather than be
 baulked. I believe him. His men believed him too. They didn't cheer aloud,
 being a dumb pack, but made ready wolfishly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Luck served him as to weather. A few days of calm would have brought
 unmentionable horrors on board that schooner, but with the help of land
 and sea breezes, in less than a week after clearing the Sunda Straits, he
 anchored off the Batu Kring mouth within a pistol-shot of the fishing
 village.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Fourteen of them packed into the schooner's long-boat (which was big,
 having been used for cargo-work) and started up the river, while two
 remained in charge of the schooner with food enough to keep starvation off
 for ten days. The tide and wind helped, and early one afternoon the big
 white boat under a ragged sail shouldered its way before the sea breeze
 into Patusan Reach, manned by fourteen assorted scarecrows glaring
 hungrily ahead, and fingering the breech-blocks of cheap rifles. Brown
 calculated upon the terrifying surprise of his appearance. They sailed in
 with the last of the flood; the Rajah's stockade gave no sign; the first
 houses on both sides of the stream seemed deserted. A few canoes were seen
 up the reach in full flight. Brown was astonished at the size of the
 place. A profound silence reigned. The wind dropped between the houses;
 two oars were got out and the boat held on up-stream, the idea being to
 effect a lodgment in the centre of the town before the inhabitants could
 think of resistance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It seems, however, that the headman of the fishing village at Batu Kring
 had managed to send off a timely warning. When the long-boat came abreast
 of the mosque (which Doramin had built: a structure with gables and roof
 finials of carved coral) the open space before it was full of people. A
 shout went up, and was followed by a clash of gongs all up the river. From
 a point above two little brass 6-pounders were discharged, and the
 round-shot came skipping down the empty reach, spurting glittering jets of
 water in the sunshine. In front of the mosque a shouting lot of men began
 firing in volleys that whipped athwart the current of the river; an
 irregular, rolling fusillade was opened on the boat from both banks, and
 Brown's men replied with a wild, rapid fire. The oars had been got in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The turn of the tide at high water comes on very quickly in that river,
 and the boat in mid-stream, nearly hidden in smoke, began to drift back
 stern foremost. Along both shores the smoke thickened also, lying below
 the roofs in a level streak as you may see a long cloud cutting the slope
 of a mountain. A tumult of war-cries, the vibrating clang of gongs, the
 deep snoring of drums, yells of rage, crashes of volley-firing, made an
 awful din, in which Brown sat confounded but steady at the tiller, working
 himself into a fury of hate and rage against those people who dared to
 defend themselves. Two of his men had been wounded, and he saw his retreat
 cut off below the town by some boats that had put off from Tunku Allang's
 stockade. There were six of them, full of men. While he was thus beset he
 perceived the entrance of the narrow creek (the same which Jim had jumped
 at low water). It was then brim full. Steering the long-boat in, they
 landed, and, to make a long story short, they established themselves on a
 little knoll about 900 yards from the stockade, which, in fact, they
 commanded from that position. The slopes of the knoll were bare, but there
 were a few trees on the summit. They went to work cutting these down for a
 breastwork, and were fairly intrenched before dark; meantime the Rajah's
 boats remained in the river with curious neutrality. When the sun set the
 glue of many brushwood blazes lighted on the river-front, and between the
 double line of houses on the land side threw into black relief the roofs,
 the groups of slender palms, the heavy clumps of fruit trees. Brown
 ordered the grass round his position to be fired; a low ring of thin
 flames under the slow ascending smoke wriggled rapidly down the slopes of
 the knoll; here and there a dry bush caught with a tall, vicious roar. The
 conflagration made a clear zone of fire for the rifles of the small party,
 and expired smouldering on the edge of the forests and along the muddy
 bank of the creek. A strip of jungle luxuriating in a damp hollow between
 the knoll and the Rajah's stockade stopped it on that side with a great
 crackling and detonations of bursting bamboo stems. The sky was sombre,
 velvety, and swarming with stars. The blackened ground smoked quietly with
 low creeping wisps, till a little breeze came on and blew everything away.
 Brown expected an attack to be delivered as soon as the tide had flowed
 enough again to enable the war-boats which had cut off his retreat to
 enter the creek. At any rate he was sure there would be an attempt to
 carry off his long-boat, which lay below the hill, a dark high lump on the
 feeble sheen of a wet mud-flat. But no move of any sort was made by the
 boats in the river. Over the stockade and the Rajah's buildings Brown saw
 their lights on the water. They seemed to be anchored across the stream.
 Other lights afloat were moving in the reach, crossing and recrossing from
 side to side. There were also lights twinkling motionless upon the long
 walls of houses up the reach, as far as the bend, and more still beyond,
 others isolated inland. The loom of the big fires disclosed buildings,
 roofs, black piles as far as he could see. It was an immense place. The
 fourteen desperate invaders lying flat behind the felled trees raised
 their chins to look over at the stir of that town that seemed to extend
 up-river for miles and swarm with thousands of angry men. They did not
 speak to each other. Now and then they would hear a loud yell, or a single
 shot rang out, fired very far somewhere. But round their position
 everything was still, dark, silent. They seemed to be forgotten, as if the
 excitement keeping awake all the population had nothing to do with them,
 as if they had been dead already.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 39
 </h2>
 <p>
 'All the events of that night have a great importance, since they brought
 about a situation which remained unchanged till Jim's return. Jim had been
 away in the interior for more than a week, and it was Dain Waris who had
 directed the first repulse. That brave and intelligent youth ("who knew
 how to fight after the manner of white men") wished to settle the business
 off-hand, but his people were too much for him. He had not Jim's racial
 prestige and the reputation of invincible, supernatural power. He was not
 the visible, tangible incarnation of unfailing truth and of unfailing
 victory. Beloved, trusted, and admired as he was, he was still one of <i>them</i>,
 while Jim was one of us. Moreover, the white man, a tower of strength in
 himself, was invulnerable, while Dain Waris could be killed. Those
 unexpressed thoughts guided the opinions of the chief men of the town, who
 elected to assemble in Jim's fort for deliberation upon the emergency, as
 if expecting to find wisdom and courage in the dwelling of the absent
 white man. The shooting of Brown's ruffians was so far good, or lucky,
 that there had been half-a-dozen casualties amongst the defenders. The
 wounded were lying on the verandah tended by their women-folk. The women
 and children from the lower part of the town had been sent into the fort
 at the first alarm. There Jewel was in command, very efficient and
 high-spirited, obeyed by Jim's "own people," who, quitting in a body their
 little settlement under the stockade, had gone in to form the garrison.
 The refugees crowded round her; and through the whole affair, to the very
 disastrous last, she showed an extraordinary martial ardour. It was to her
 that Dain Waris had gone at once at the first intelligence of danger, for
 you must know that Jim was the only one in Patusan who possessed a store
 of gunpowder. Stein, with whom he had kept up intimate relations by
 letters, had obtained from the Dutch Government a special authorisation to
 export five hundred kegs of it to Patusan. The powder-magazine was a small
 hut of rough logs covered entirely with earth, and in Jim's absence the
 girl had the key. In the council, held at eleven o'clock in the evening in
 Jim's dining-room, she backed up Waris's advice for immediate and vigorous
 action. I am told that she stood up by the side of Jim's empty chair at
 the head of the long table and made a warlike impassioned speech, which
 for the moment extorted murmurs of approbation from the assembled headmen.
 Old Doramin, who had not showed himself outside his own gate for more than
 a year, had been brought across with great difficulty. He was, of course,
 the chief man there. The temper of the council was very unforgiving, and
 the old man's word would have been decisive; but it is my opinion that,
 well aware of his son's fiery courage, he dared not pronounce the word.
 More dilatory counsels prevailed. A certain Haji Saman pointed out at
 great length that "these tyrannical and ferocious men had delivered
 themselves to a certain death in any case. They would stand fast on their
 hill and starve, or they would try to regain their boat and be shot from
 ambushes across the creek, or they would break and fly into the forest and
 perish singly there." He argued that by the use of proper stratagems these
 evil-minded strangers could be destroyed without the risk of a battle, and
 his words had a great weight, especially with the Patusan men proper. What
 unsettled the minds of the townsfolk was the failure of the Rajah's boats
 to act at the decisive moment. It was the diplomatic Kassim who
 represented the Rajah at the council. He spoke very little, listened
 smilingly, very friendly and impenetrable. During the sitting messengers
 kept arriving every few minutes almost, with reports of the invaders'
 proceedings. Wild and exaggerated rumours were flying: there was a large
 ship at the mouth of the river with big guns and many more men?some
 white, others with black skins and of bloodthirsty appearance. They were
 coming with many more boats to exterminate every living thing. A sense of
 near, incomprehensible danger affected the common people. At one moment
 there was a panic in the courtyard amongst the women; shrieking; a rush;
 children crying?Haji Sunan went out to quiet them. Then a fort
 sentry fired at something moving on the river, and nearly killed a
 villager bringing in his women-folk in a canoe together with the best of
 his domestic utensils and a dozen fowls. This caused more confusion.
 Meantime the palaver inside Jim's house went on in the presence of the
 girl. Doramin sat fierce-faced, heavy, looking at the speakers in turn,
 and breathing slow like a bull. He didn't speak till the last, after
 Kassim had declared that the Rajah's boats would be called in because the
 men were required to defend his master's stockade. Dain Waris in his
 father's presence would offer no opinion, though the girl entreated him in
 Jim's name to speak out. She offered him Jim's own men in her anxiety to
 have these intruders driven out at once. He only shook his head, after a
 glance or two at Doramin. Finally, when the council broke up it had been
 decided that the houses nearest the creek should be strongly occupied to
 obtain the command of the enemy's boat. The boat itself was not to be
 interfered with openly, so that the robbers on the hill should be tempted
 to embark, when a well-directed fire would kill most of them, no doubt. To
 cut off the escape of those who might survive, and to prevent more of them
 coming up, Dain Waris was ordered by Doramin to take an armed party of
 Bugis down the river to a certain spot ten miles below Patusan, and there
 form a camp on the shore and blockade the stream with the canoes. I don't
 believe for a moment that Doramin feared the arrival of fresh forces. My
 opinion is that his conduct was guided solely by his wish to keep his son
 out of harm's way. To prevent a rush being made into the town the
 construction of a stockade was to be commenced at daylight at the end of
 the street on the left bank. The old nakhoda declared his intention to
 command there himself. A distribution of powder, bullets, and
 percussion-caps was made immediately under the girl's supervision. Several
 messengers were to be dispatched in different directions after Jim, whose
 exact whereabouts were unknown. These men started at dawn, but before that
 time Kassim had managed to open communications with the besieged Brown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'That accomplished diplomatist and confidant of the Rajah, on leaving the
 fort to go back to his master, took into his boat Cornelius, whom he found
 slinking mutely amongst the people in the courtyard. Kassim had a little
 plan of his own and wanted him for an interpreter. Thus it came about that
 towards morning Brown, reflecting upon the desperate nature of his
 position, heard from the marshy overgrown hollow an amicable, quavering,
 strained voice crying?in English?for permission to come up,
 under a promise of personal safety and on a very important errand. He was
 overjoyed. If he was spoken to he was no longer a hunted wild beast. These
 friendly sounds took off at once the awful stress of vigilant watchfulness
 as of so many blind men not knowing whence the deathblow might come. He
 pretended a great reluctance. The voice declared itself "a white man?a
 poor, ruined, old man who had been living here for years." A mist, wet and
 chilly, lay on the slopes of the hill, and after some more shouting from
 one to the other, Brown called out, "Come on, then, but alone, mind!" As a
 matter of fact?he told me, writhing with rage at the recollection of
 his helplessness?it made no difference. They couldn't see more than
 a few yards before them, and no treachery could make their position worse.
 By-and-by Cornelius, in his week-day attire of a ragged dirty shirt and
 pants, barefooted, with a broken-rimmed pith hat on his head, was made out
 vaguely, sidling up to the defences, hesitating, stopping to listen in a
 peering posture. "Come along! You are safe," yelled Brown, while his men
 stared. All their hopes of life became suddenly centered in that
 dilapidated, mean newcomer, who in profound silence clambered clumsily
 over a felled tree-trunk, and shivering, with his sour, mistrustful face,
 looked about at the knot of bearded, anxious, sleepless desperadoes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Half an hour's confidential talk with Cornelius opened Brown's eyes as to
 the home affairs of Patusan. He was on the alert at once. There were
 possibilities, immense possibilities; but before he would talk over
 Cornelius's proposals he demanded that some food should be sent up as a
 guarantee of good faith. Cornelius went off, creeping sluggishly down the
 hill on the side of the Rajah's palace, and after some delay a few of
 Tunku Allang's men came up, bringing a scanty supply of rice, chillies,
 and dried fish. This was immeasurably better than nothing. Later on
 Cornelius returned accompanying Kassim, who stepped out with an air of
 perfect good-humoured trustfulness, in sandals, and muffled up from neck
 to ankles in dark-blue sheeting. He shook hands with Brown discreetly, and
 the three drew aside for a conference. Brown's men, recovering their
 confidence, were slapping each other on the back, and cast knowing glances
 at their captain while they busied themselves with preparations for
 cooking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Kassim disliked Doramin and his Bugis very much, but he hated the new
 order of things still more. It had occurred to him that these whites,
 together with the Rajah's followers, could attack and defeat the Bugis
 before Jim's return. Then, he reasoned, general defection of the townsfolk
 was sure to follow, and the reign of the white man who protected poor
 people would be over. Afterwards the new allies could be dealt with. They
 would have no friends. The fellow was perfectly able to perceive the
 difference of character, and had seen enough of white men to know that
 these newcomers were outcasts, men without country. Brown preserved a
 stern and inscrutable demeanour. When he first heard Cornelius's voice
 demanding admittance, it brought merely the hope of a loophole for escape.
 In less than an hour other thoughts were seething in his head. Urged by an
 extreme necessity, he had come there to steal food, a few tons of rubber
 or gum may be, perhaps a handful of dollars, and had found himself
 enmeshed by deadly dangers. Now in consequence of these overtures from
 Kassim he began to think of stealing the whole country. Some confounded
 fellow had apparently accomplished something of the kind?single-handed
 at that. Couldn't have done it very well though. Perhaps they could work
 together?squeeze everything dry and then go out quietly. In the
 course of his negotiations with Kassim he became aware that he was
 supposed to have a big ship with plenty of men outside. Kassim begged him
 earnestly to have this big ship with his many guns and men brought up the
 river without delay for the Rajah's service. Brown professed himself
 willing, and on this basis the negotiation was carried on with mutual
 distrust. Three times in the course of the morning the courteous and
 active Kassim went down to consult the Rajah and came up busily with his
 long stride. Brown, while bargaining, had a sort of grim enjoyment in
 thinking of his wretched schooner, with nothing but a heap of dirt in her
 hold, that stood for an armed ship, and a Chinaman and a lame
 ex-beachcomber of Levuka on board, who represented all his many men. In
 the afternoon he obtained further doles of food, a promise of some money,
 and a supply of mats for his men to make shelters for themselves. They lay
 down and snored, protected from the burning sunshine; but Brown, sitting
 fully exposed on one of the felled trees, feasted his eyes upon the view
 of the town and the river. There was much loot there. Cornelius, who had
 made himself at home in the camp, talked at his elbow, pointing out the
 localities, imparting advice, giving his own version of Jim's character,
 and commenting in his own fashion upon the events of the last three years.
 Brown, who, apparently indifferent and gazing away, listened with
 attention to every word, could not make out clearly what sort of man this
 Jim could be. "What's his name? Jim! Jim! That's not enough for a man's
 name." "They call him," said Cornelius scornfully, "Tuan Jim here. As you
 may say Lord Jim." "What is he? Where does he come from?" inquired Brown.
 "What sort of man is he? Is he an Englishman?" "Yes, yes, he's an
 Englishman. I am an Englishman too. From Malacca. He is a fool. All you
 have to do is to kill him and then you are king here. Everything belongs
 to him," explained Cornelius. "It strikes me he may be made to share with
 somebody before very long," commented Brown half aloud. "No, no. The
 proper way is to kill him the first chance you get, and then you can do
 what you like," Cornelius would insist earnestly. "I have lived for many
 years here, and I am giving you a friend's advice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In such converse and in gloating over the view of Patusan, which he had
 determined in his mind should become his prey, Brown whiled away most of
 the afternoon, his men, meantime, resting. On that day Dain Waris's fleet
 of canoes stole one by one under the shore farthest from the creek, and
 went down to close the river against his retreat. Of this Brown was not
 aware, and Kassim, who came up the knoll an hour before sunset, took good
 care not to enlighten him. He wanted the white man's ship to come up the
 river, and this news, he feared, would be discouraging. He was very
 pressing with Brown to send the "order," offering at the same time a
 trusty messenger, who for greater secrecy (as he explained) would make his
 way by land to the mouth of the river and deliver the "order" on board.
 After some reflection Brown judged it expedient to tear a page out of his
 pocket-book, on which he simply wrote, "We are getting on. Big job. Detain
 the man." The stolid youth selected by Kassim for that service performed
 it faithfully, and was rewarded by being suddenly tipped, head first, into
 the schooner's empty hold by the ex-beachcomber and the Chinaman, who
 thereupon hastened to put on the hatches. What became of him afterwards
 Brown did not say.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 40
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Brown's object was to gain time by fooling with Kassim's diplomacy. For
 doing a real stroke of business he could not help thinking the white man
 was the person to work with. He could not imagine such a chap (who must be
 confoundedly clever after all to get hold of the natives like that)
 refusing a help that would do away with the necessity for slow, cautious,
 risky cheating, that imposed itself as the only possible line of conduct
 for a single-handed man. He, Brown, would offer him the power. No man
 could hesitate. Everything was in coming to a clear understanding. Of
 course they would share. The idea of there being a fort?all ready to
 his hand?a real fort, with artillery (he knew this from Cornelius),
 excited him. Let him only once get in and . . . He would impose modest
 conditions. Not too low, though. The man was no fool, it seemed. They
 would work like brothers till . . . till the time came for a quarrel and a
 shot that would settle all accounts. With grim impatience of plunder he
 wished himself to be talking with the man now. The land already seemed to
 be his to tear to pieces, squeeze, and throw away. Meantime Kassim had to
 be fooled for the sake of food first?and for a second string. But
 the principal thing was to get something to eat from day to day. Besides,
 he was not averse to begin fighting on that Rajah's account, and teach a
 lesson to those people who had received him with shots. The lust of battle
 was upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I am sorry that I can't give you this part of the story, which of course
 I have mainly from Brown, in Brown's own words. There was in the broken,
 violent speech of that man, unveiling before me his thoughts with the very
 hand of Death upon his throat, an undisguised ruthlessness of purpose, a
 strange vengeful attitude towards his own past, and a blind belief in the
 righteousness of his will against all mankind, something of that feeling
 which could induce the leader of a horde of wandering cut-throats to call
 himself proudly the Scourge of God. No doubt the natural senseless
 ferocity which is the basis of such a character was exasperated by
 failure, ill-luck, and the recent privations, as well as by the desperate
 position in which he found himself; but what was most remarkable of all
 was this, that while he planned treacherous alliances, had already settled
 in his own mind the fate of the white man, and intrigued in an
 overbearing, offhand manner with Kassim, one could perceive that what he
 had really desired, almost in spite of himself, was to play havoc with
 that jungle town which had defied him, to see it strewn over with corpses
 and enveloped in flames. Listening to his pitiless, panting voice, I could
 imagine how he must have looked at it from the hillock, peopling it with
 images of murder and rapine. The part nearest to the creek wore an
 abandoned aspect, though as a matter of fact every house concealed a few
 armed men on the alert. Suddenly beyond the stretch of waste ground,
 interspersed with small patches of low dense bush, excavations, heaps of
 rubbish, with trodden paths between, a man, solitary and looking very
 small, strolled out into the deserted opening of the street between the
 shut-up, dark, lifeless buildings at the end. Perhaps one of the
 inhabitants, who had fled to the other bank of the river, coming back for
 some object of domestic use. Evidently he supposed himself quite safe at
 that distance from the hill on the other side of the creek. A light
 stockade, set up hastily, was just round the turn of the street, full of
 his friends. He moved leisurely. Brown saw him, and instantly called to
 his side the Yankee deserter, who acted as a sort of second in command.
 This lanky, loose-jointed fellow came forward, wooden-faced, trailing his
 rifle lazily. When he understood what was wanted from him a homicidal and
 conceited smile uncovered his teeth, making two deep folds down his
 sallow, leathery cheeks. He prided himself on being a dead shot. He
 dropped on one knee, and taking aim from a steady rest through the
 unlopped branches of a felled tree, fired, and at once stood up to look.
 The man, far away, turned his head to the report, made another step
 forward, seemed to hesitate, and abruptly got down on his hands and knees.
 In the silence that fell upon the sharp crack of the rifle, the dead shot,
 keeping his eyes fixed upon the quarry, guessed that "this there coon's
 health would never be a source of anxiety to his friends any more." The
 man's limbs were seen to move rapidly under his body in an endeavour to
 run on all-fours. In that empty space arose a multitudinous shout of
 dismay and surprise. The man sank flat, face down, and moved no more.
 "That showed them what we could do," said Brown to me. "Struck the fear of
 sudden death into them. That was what we wanted. They were two hundred to
 one, and this gave them something to think over for the night. Not one of
 them had an idea of such a long shot before. That beggar belonging to the
 Rajah scooted down-hill with his eyes hanging out of his head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'As he was telling me this he tried with a shaking hand to wipe the thin
 foam on his blue lips. "Two hundred to one. Two hundred to one . . .
 strike terror, . . . terror, terror, I tell you. . . ." His own eyes were
 starting out of their sockets. He fell back, clawing the air with skinny
 fingers, sat up again, bowed and hairy, glared at me sideways like some
 man-beast of folk-lore, with open mouth in his miserable and awful agony
 before he got his speech back after that fit. There are sights one never
 forgets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Furthermore, to draw the enemy's fire and locate such parties as might
 have been hiding in the bushes along the creek, Brown ordered the Solomon
 Islander to go down to the boat and bring an oar, as you send a spaniel
 after a stick into the water. This failed, and the fellow came back
 without a single shot having been fired at him from anywhere. "There's
 nobody," opined some of the men. It is "onnatural," remarked the Yankee.
 Kassim had gone, by that time, very much impressed, pleased too, and also
 uneasy. Pursuing his tortuous policy, he had dispatched a message to Dain
 Waris warning him to look out for the white men's ship, which, he had had
 information, was about to come up the river. He minimised its strength and
 exhorted him to oppose its passage. This double-dealing answered his
 purpose, which was to keep the Bugis forces divided and to weaken them by
 fighting. On the other hand, he had in the course of that day sent word to
 the assembled Bugis chiefs in town, assuring them that he was trying to
 induce the invaders to retire; his messages to the fort asked earnestly
 for powder for the Rajah's men. It was a long time since Tunku Allang had
 had ammunition for the score or so of old muskets rusting in their
 arm-racks in the audience-hall. The open intercourse between the hill and
 the palace unsettled all the minds. It was already time for men to take
 sides, it began to be said. There would soon be much bloodshed, and
 thereafter great trouble for many people. The social fabric of orderly,
 peaceful life, when every man was sure of to-morrow, the edifice raised by
 Jim's hands, seemed on that evening ready to collapse into a ruin reeking
 with blood. The poorer folk were already taking to the bush or flying up
 the river. A good many of the upper class judged it necessary to go and
 pay their court to the Rajah. The Rajah's youths jostled them rudely. Old
 Tunku Allang, almost out of his mind with fear and indecision, either kept
 a sullen silence or abused them violently for daring to come with empty
 hands: they departed very much frightened; only old Doramin kept his
 countrymen together and pursued his tactics inflexibly. Enthroned in a big
 chair behind the improvised stockade, he issued his orders in a deep
 veiled rumble, unmoved, like a deaf man, in the flying rumours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Dusk fell, hiding first the body of the dead man, which had been left
 lying with arms outstretched as if nailed to the ground, and then the
 revolving sphere of the night rolled smoothly over Patusan and came to a
 rest, showering the glitter of countless worlds upon the earth. Again, in
 the exposed part of the town big fires blazed along the only street,
 revealing from distance to distance upon their glares the falling straight
 lines of roofs, the fragments of wattled walls jumbled in confusion, here
 and there a whole hut elevated in the glow upon the vertical black stripes
 of a group of high piles and all this line of dwellings, revealed in
 patches by the swaying flames, seemed to flicker tortuously away up-river
 into the gloom at the heart of the land. A great silence, in which the
 looms of successive fires played without noise, extended into the darkness
 at the foot of the hill; but the other bank of the river, all dark save
 for a solitary bonfire at the river-front before the fort, sent out into
 the air an increasing tremor that might have been the stamping of a
 multitude of feet, the hum of many voices, or the fall of an immensely
 distant waterfall. It was then, Brown confessed to me, while, turning his
 back on his men, he sat looking at it all, that notwithstanding his
 disdain, his ruthless faith in himself, a feeling came over him that at
 last he had run his head against a stone wall. Had his boat been afloat at
 the time, he believed he would have tried to steal away, taking his
 chances of a long chase down the river and of starvation at sea. It is
 very doubtful whether he would have succeeded in getting away. However, he
 didn't try this. For another moment he had a passing thought of trying to
 rush the town, but he perceived very well that in the end he would find
 himself in the lighted street, where they would be shot down like dogs
 from the houses. They were two hundred to one?he thought, while his
 men, huddling round two heaps of smouldering embers, munched the last of
 the bananas and roasted the few yams they owed to Kassim's diplomacy.
 Cornelius sat amongst them dozing sulkily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Then one of the whites remembered that some tobacco had been left in the
 boat, and, encouraged by the impunity of the Solomon Islander, said he
 would go to fetch it. At this all the others shook off their despondency.
 Brown applied to, said, "Go, and be d?d to you," scornfully. He
 didn't think there was any danger in going to the creek in the dark. The
 man threw a leg over the tree-trunk and disappeared. A moment later he was
 heard clambering into the boat and then clambering out. "I've got it," he
 cried. A flash and a report at the very foot of the hill followed. "I am
 hit," yelled the man. "Look out, look out?I am hit," and instantly
 all the rifles went off. The hill squirted fire and noise into the night
 like a little volcano, and when Brown and the Yankee with curses and cuffs
 stopped the panic-stricken firing, a profound, weary groan floated up from
 the creek, succeeded by a plaint whose heartrending sadness was like some
 poison turning the blood cold in the veins. Then a strong voice pronounced
 several distinct incomprehensible words somewhere beyond the creek. "Let
 no one fire," shouted Brown. "What does it mean?" . . . "Do you hear on
 the hill? Do you hear? Do you hear?" repeated the voice three times.
 Cornelius translated, and then prompted the answer. "Speak," cried Brown,
 "we hear." Then the voice, declaiming in the sonorous inflated tone of a
 herald, and shifting continually on the edge of the vague waste-land,
 proclaimed that between the men of the Bugis nation living in Patusan and
 the white men on the hill and those with them, there would be no faith, no
 compassion, no speech, no peace. A bush rustled; a haphazard volley rang
 out. "Dam' foolishness," muttered the Yankee, vexedly grounding the butt.
 Cornelius translated. The wounded man below the hill, after crying out
 twice, "Take me up! take me up!" went on complaining in moans. While he
 had kept on the blackened earth of the slope, and afterwards crouching in
 the boat, he had been safe enough. It seems that in his joy at finding the
 tobacco he forgot himself and jumped out on her off-side, as it were. The
 white boat, lying high and dry, showed him up; the creek was no more than
 seven yards wide in that place, and there happened to be a man crouching
 in the bush on the other bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He was a Bugis of Tondano only lately come to Patusan, and a relation of
 the man shot in the afternoon. That famous long shot had indeed appalled
 the beholders. The man in utter security had been struck down, in full
 view of his friends, dropping with a joke on his lips, and they seemed to
 see in the act an atrocity which had stirred a bitter rage. That relation
 of his, Si-Lapa by name, was then with Doramin in the stockade only a few
 feet away. You who know these chaps must admit that the fellow showed an
 unusual pluck by volunteering to carry the message, alone, in the dark.
 Creeping across the open ground, he had deviated to the left and found
 himself opposite the boat. He was startled when Brown's man shouted. He
 came to a sitting position with his gun to his shoulder, and when the
 other jumped out, exposing himself, he pulled the trigger and lodged three
 jagged slugs point-blank into the poor wretch's stomach. Then, lying flat
 on his face, he gave himself up for dead, while a thin hail of lead
 chopped and swished the bushes close on his right hand; afterwards he
 delivered his speech shouting, bent double, dodging all the time in cover.
 With the last word he leaped sideways, lay close for a while, and
 afterwards got back to the houses unharmed, having achieved on that night
 such a renown as his children will not willingly allow to die.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And on the hill the forlorn band let the two little heaps of embers go
 out under their bowed heads. They sat dejected on the ground with
 compressed lips and downcast eyes, listening to their comrade below. He
 was a strong man and died hard, with moans now loud, now sinking to a
 strange confidential note of pain. Sometimes he shrieked, and again, after
 a period of silence, he could be heard muttering deliriously a long and
 unintelligible complaint. Never for a moment did he cease.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"What's the good?" Brown had said unmoved once, seeing the Yankee, who
 had been swearing under his breath, prepare to go down. "That's so,"
 assented the deserter, reluctantly desisting. "There's no encouragement
 for wounded men here. Only his noise is calculated to make all the others
 think too much of the hereafter, cap'n." "Water!" cried the wounded man in
 an extraordinarily clear vigorous voice, and then went off moaning feebly.
 "Ay, water. Water will do it," muttered the other to himself, resignedly.
 "Plenty by-and-by. The tide is flowing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'At last the tide flowed, silencing the plaint and the cries of pain, and
 the dawn was near when Brown, sitting with his chin in the palm of his
 hand before Patusan, as one might stare at the unscalable side of a
 mountain, heard the brief ringing bark of a brass 6-pounder far away in
 town somewhere. "What's this?" he asked of Cornelius, who hung about him.
 Cornelius listened. A muffled roaring shout rolled down-river over the
 town; a big drum began to throb, and others responded, pulsating and
 droning. Tiny scattered lights began to twinkle in the dark half of the
 town, while the part lighted by the loom of fires hummed with a deep and
 prolonged murmur. "He has come," said Cornelius. "What? Already? Are you
 sure?" Brown asked. "Yes! yes! Sure. Listen to the noise." "What are they
 making that row about?" pursued Brown. "For joy," snorted Cornelius; "he
 is a very great man, but all the same, he knows no more than a child, and
 so they make a great noise to please him, because they know no better."
 "Look here," said Brown, "how is one to get at him?" "He shall come to
 talk to you," Cornelius declared. "What do you mean? Come down here
 strolling as it were?" Cornelius nodded vigorously in the dark. "Yes. He
 will come straight here and talk to you. He is just like a fool. You shall
 see what a fool he is." Brown was incredulous. "You shall see; you shall
 see," repeated Cornelius. "He is not afraid?not afraid of anything.
 He will come and order you to leave his people alone. Everybody must leave
 his people alone. He is like a little child. He will come to you
 straight." Alas! he knew Jim well?that "mean little skunk," as Brown
 called him to me. "Yes, certainly," he pursued with ardour, "and then,
 captain, you tell that tall man with a gun to shoot him. Just you kill
 him, and you will frighten everybody so much that you can do anything you
 like with them afterwards?get what you like?go away when you
 like. Ha! ha! ha! Fine . . ." He almost danced with impatience and
 eagerness; and Brown, looking over his shoulder at him, could see, shown
 up by the pitiless dawn, his men drenched with dew, sitting amongst the
 cold ashes and the litter of the camp, haggard, cowed, and in rags.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 41
 </h2>
 <p>
 'To the very last moment, till the full day came upon them with a spring,
 the fires on the west bank blazed bright and clear; and then Brown saw in
 a knot of coloured figures motionless between the advanced houses a man in
 European clothes, in a helmet, all white. "That's him; look! look!"
 Cornelius said excitedly. All Brown's men had sprung up and crowded at his
 back with lustreless eyes. The group of vivid colours and dark faces with
 the white figure in their midst were observing the knoll. Brown could see
 naked arms being raised to shade the eyes and other brown arms pointing.
 What should he do? He looked around, and the forests that faced him on all
 sides walled the cock-pit of an unequal contest. He looked once more at
 his men. A contempt, a weariness, the desire of life, the wish to try for
 one more chance?for some other grave?struggled in his breast.
 From the outline the figure presented it seemed to him that the white man
 there, backed up by all the power of the land, was examining his position
 through binoculars. Brown jumped up on the log, throwing his arms up, the
 palms outwards. The coloured group closed round the white man, and fell
 back twice before he got clear of them, walking slowly alone. Brown
 remained standing on the log till Jim, appearing and disappearing between
 the patches of thorny scrub, had nearly reached the creek; then Brown
 jumped off and went down to meet him on his side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'They met, I should think, not very far from the place, perhaps on the
 very spot, where Jim took the second desperate leap of his life?the
 leap that landed him into the life of Patusan, into the trust, the love,
 the confidence of the people. They faced each other across the creek, and
 with steady eyes tried to understand each other before they opened their
 lips. Their antagonism must have been expressed in their glances; I know
 that Brown hated Jim at first sight. Whatever hopes he might have had
 vanished at once. This was not the man he had expected to see. He hated
 him for this?and in a checked flannel shirt with sleeves cut off at
 the elbows, grey bearded, with a sunken, sun-blackened face?he
 cursed in his heart the other's youth and assurance, his clear eyes and
 his untroubled bearing. That fellow had got in a long way before him! He
 did not look like a man who would be willing to give anything for
 assistance. He had all the advantages on his side?possession,
 security, power; he was on the side of an overwhelming force! He was not
 hungry and desperate, and he did not seem in the least afraid. And there
 was something in the very neatness of Jim's clothes, from the white helmet
 to the canvas leggings and the pipeclayed shoes, which in Brown's sombre
 irritated eyes seemed to belong to things he had in the very shaping of
 his life condemned and flouted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Who are you?" asked Jim at last, speaking in his usual voice. "My name's
 Brown," answered the other loudly; "Captain Brown. What's yours?" and Jim
 after a little pause went on quietly, as If he had not heard: "What made
 you come here?" "You want to know," said Brown bitterly. "It's easy to
 tell. Hunger. And what made you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"The fellow started at this," said Brown, relating to me the opening of
 this strange conversation between those two men, separated only by the
 muddy bed of a creek, but standing on the opposite poles of that
 conception of life which includes all mankind?"The fellow started at
 this and got very red in the face. Too big to be questioned, I suppose. I
 told him that if he looked upon me as a dead man with whom you may take
 liberties, he himself was not a whit better off really. I had a fellow up
 there who had a bead drawn on him all the time, and only waited for a sign
 from me. There was nothing to be shocked at in this. He had come down of
 his own free will. 'Let us agree,' said I, 'that we are both dead men, and
 let us talk on that basis, as equals. We are all equal before death,' I
 said. I admitted I was there like a rat in a trap, but we had been driven
 to it, and even a trapped rat can give a bite. He caught me up in a
 moment. 'Not if you don't go near the trap till the rat is dead.' I told
 him that sort of game was good enough for these native friends of his, but
 I would have thought him too white to serve even a rat so. Yes, I had
 wanted to talk with him. Not to beg for my life, though. My fellows were?well?what
 they were?men like himself, anyhow. All we wanted from him was to
 come on in the devil's name and have it out. 'God d?n it,' said I,
 while he stood there as still as a wooden post, 'you don't want to come
 out here every day with your glasses to count how many of us are left on
 our feet. Come. Either bring your infernal crowd along or let us go out
 and starve in the open sea, by God! You have been white once, for all your
 tall talk of this being your own people and you being one with them. Are
 you? And what the devil do you get for it; what is it you've found here
 that is so d?d precious? Hey? You don't want us to come down here
 perhaps?do you? You are two hundred to one. You don't want us to
 come down into the open. Ah! I promise you we shall give you some sport
 before you've done. You talk about me making a cowardly set upon
 unoffending people. What's that to me that they are unoffending, when I am
 starving for next to no offence? But I am not a coward. Don't you be one.
 Bring them along or, by all the fiends, we shall yet manage to send half
 your unoffending town to heaven with us in smoke!'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'He was terrible?relating this to me?this tortured skeleton of
 a man drawn up together with his face over his knees, upon a miserable bed
 in that wretched hovel, and lifting his head to look at me with malignant
 triumph.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"That's what I told him?I knew what to say," he began again, feebly
 at first, but working himself up with incredible speed into a fiery
 utterance of his scorn. "We aren't going into the forest to wander like a
 string of living skeletons dropping one after another for ants to go to
 work upon us before we are fairly dead. Oh no! . . . 'You don't deserve a
 better fate,' he said. 'And what do you deserve,' I shouted at him, 'you
 that I find skulking here with your mouth full of your responsibility, of
 innocent lives, of your infernal duty? What do you know more of me than I
 know of you? I came here for food. D'ye hear??food to fill our
 bellies. And what did <i>you</i> come for? What did you ask for when you
 came here? We don't ask you for anything but to give us a fight or a clear
 road to go back whence we came. . . .' 'I would fight with you now,' says
 he, pulling at his little moustache. 'And I would let you shoot me, and
 welcome,' I said. 'This is as good a jumping-off place for me as another.
 I am sick of my infernal luck. But it would be too easy. There are my men
 in the same boat?and, by God, I am not the sort to jump out of
 trouble and leave them in a d?d lurch,' I said. He stood thinking
 for a while and then wanted to know what I had done ('out there' he says,
 tossing his head down-stream) to be hazed about so. 'Have we met to tell
 each other the story of our lives?' I asked him. 'Suppose you begin. No?
 Well, I am sure I don't want to hear. Keep it to yourself. I know it is no
 better than mine. I've lived?and so did you, though you talk as if
 you were one of those people that should have wings so as to go about
 without touching the dirty earth. Well?it is dirty. I haven't got
 any wings. I am here because I was afraid once in my life. Want to know
 what of? Of a prison. That scares me, and you may know it?if it's
 any good to you. I won't ask you what scared you into this infernal hole,
 where you seem to have found pretty pickings. That's your luck and this is
 mine?the privilege to beg for the favour of being shot quickly, or
 else kicked out to go free and starve in my own way.' . . ."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His debilitated body shook with an exultation so vehement, so assured,
 and so malicious that it seemed to have driven off the death waiting for
 him in that hut. The corpse of his mad self-love uprose from rags and
 destitution as from the dark horrors of a tomb. It is impossible to say
 how much he lied to Jim then, how much he lied to me now?and to
 himself always. Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory, and the truth
 of every passion wants some pretence to make it live. Standing at the gate
 of the other world in the guise of a beggar, he had slapped this world's
 face, he had spat on it, he had thrown upon it an immensity of scorn and
 revolt at the bottom of his misdeeds. He had overcome them all?men,
 women, savages, traders, ruffians, missionaries?and Jim?"that
 beefy-faced beggar." I did not begrudge him this triumph in articulo
 mortis, this almost posthumous illusion of having trampled all the earth
 under his feet. While he was boasting to me, in his sordid and repulsive
 agony, I couldn't help thinking of the chuckling talk relating to the time
 of his greatest splendour when, during a year or more, Gentleman Brown's
 ship was to be seen, for many days on end, hovering off an islet befringed
 with green upon azure, with the dark dot of the mission-house on a white
 beach; while Gentleman Brown, ashore, was casting his spells over a
 romantic girl for whom Melanesia had been too much, and giving hopes of a
 remarkable conversion to her husband. The poor man, some time or other,
 had been heard to express the intention of winning "Captain Brown to a
 better way of life." . . . "Bag Gentleman Brown for Glory"?as a
 leery-eyed loafer expressed it once?"just to let them see up above
 what a Western Pacific trading skipper looks like." And this was the man,
 too, who had run off with a dying woman, and had shed tears over her body.
 "Carried on like a big baby," his then mate was never tired of telling,
 "and where the fun came in may I be kicked to death by diseased Kanakas if
 <i>I</i> know. Why, gents! she was too far gone when he brought her aboard
 to know him; she just lay there on her back in his bunk staring at the
 beam with awful shining eyes?and then she died. Dam' bad sort of
 fever, I guess. . . ." I remembered all these stories while, wiping his
 matted lump of a beard with a livid hand, he was telling me from his
 noisome couch how he got round, got in, got home, on that confounded,
 immaculate, don't-you-touch-me sort of fellow. He admitted that he
 couldn't be scared, but there was a way, "as broad as a turnpike, to get
 in and shake his twopenny soul around and inside out and upside down?by
 God!"'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 42
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I don't think he could do more than perhaps look upon that straight path.
 He seemed to have been puzzled by what he saw, for he interrupted himself
 in his narrative more than once to exclaim, "He nearly slipped from me
 there. I could not make him out. Who was he?" And after glaring at me
 wildly he would go on, jubilating and sneering. To me the conversation of
 these two across the creek appears now as the deadliest kind of duel on
 which Fate looked on with her cold-eyed knowledge of the end. No, he
 didn't turn Jim's soul inside out, but I am much mistaken if the spirit so
 utterly out of his reach had not been made to taste to the full the
 bitterness of that contest. These were the emissaries with whom the world
 he had renounced was pursuing him in his retreat?white men from "out
 there" where he did not think himself good enough to live. This was all
 that came to him?a menace, a shock, a danger to his work. I suppose
 it is this sad, half-resentful, half-resigned feeling, piercing through
 the few words Jim said now and then, that puzzled Brown so much in the
 reading of his character. Some great men owe most of their greatness to
 the ability of detecting in those they destine for their tools the exact
 quality of strength that matters for their work; and Brown, as though he
 had been really great, had a satanic gift of finding out the best and the
 weakest spot in his victims. He admitted to me that Jim wasn't of the sort
 that can be got over by truckling, and accordingly he took care to show
 himself as a man confronting without dismay ill-luck, censure, and
 disaster. The smuggling of a few guns was no great crime, he pointed out.
 As to coming to Patusan, who had the right to say he hadn't come to beg?
 The infernal people here let loose at him from both banks without staying
 to ask questions. He made the point brazenly, for, in truth, Dain Waris's
 energetic action had prevented the greatest calamities; because Brown told
 me distinctly that, perceiving the size of the place, he had resolved
 instantly in his mind that as soon as he had gained a footing he would set
 fire right and left, and begin by shooting down everything living in
 sight, in order to cow and terrify the population. The disproportion of
 forces was so great that this was the only way giving him the slightest
 chance of attaining his ends?he argued in a fit of coughing. But he
 didn't tell Jim this. As to the hardships and starvation they had gone
 through, these had been very real; it was enough to look at his band. He
 made, at the sound of a shrill whistle, all his men appear standing in a
 row on the logs in full view, so that Jim could see them. For the killing
 of the man, it had been done?well, it had?but was not this
 war, bloody war?in a corner? and the fellow had been killed cleanly,
 shot through the chest, not like that poor devil of his lying now in the
 creek. They had to listen to him dying for six hours, with his entrails
 torn with slugs. At any rate this was a life for a life. . . . And all
 this was said with the weariness, with the recklessness of a man spurred
 on and on by ill-luck till he cares not where he runs. When he asked Jim,
 with a sort of brusque despairing frankness, whether he himself?straight
 now?didn't understand that when "it came to saving one's life in the
 dark, one didn't care who else went?three, thirty, three hundred
 people"?it was as if a demon had been whispering advice in his ear.
 "I made him wince," boasted Brown to me. "He very soon left off coming the
 righteous over me. He just stood there with nothing to say, and looking as
 black as thunder?not at me?on the ground." He asked Jim
 whether he had nothing fishy in his life to remember that he was so
 damnedly hard upon a man trying to get out of a deadly hole by the first
 means that came to hand?and so on, and so on. And there ran through
 the rough talk a vein of subtle reference to their common blood, an
 assumption of common experience; a sickening suggestion of common guilt,
 of secret knowledge that was like a bond of their minds and of their
 hearts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'At last Brown threw himself down full length and watched Jim out of the
 corners of his eyes. Jim on his side of the creek stood thinking and
 switching his leg. The houses in view were silent, as if a pestilence had
 swept them clean of every breath of life; but many invisible eyes were
 turned, from within, upon the two men with the creek between them, a
 stranded white boat, and the body of the third man half sunk in the mud.
 On the river canoes were moving again, for Patusan was recovering its
 belief in the stability of earthly institutions since the return of the
 white lord. The right bank, the platforms of the houses, the rafts moored
 along the shores, even the roofs of bathing-huts, were covered with people
 that, far away out of earshot and almost out of sight, were straining
 their eyes towards the knoll beyond the Rajah's stockade. Within the wide
 irregular ring of forests, broken in two places by the sheen of the river,
 there was a silence. "Will you promise to leave the coast?" Jim asked.
 Brown lifted and let fall his hand, giving everything up as it were?accepting
 the inevitable. "And surrender your arms?" Jim went on. Brown sat up and
 glared across. "Surrender our arms! Not till you come to take them out of
 our stiff hands. You think I am gone crazy with funk? Oh no! That and the
 rags I stand in is all I have got in the world, besides a few more
 breechloaders on board; and I expect to sell the lot in Madagascar, if I
 ever get so far?begging my way from ship to ship."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Jim said nothing to this. At last, throwing away the switch he held in
 his hand, he said, as if speaking to himself, "I don't know whether I have
 the power." . . . "You don't know! And you wanted me just now to give up
 my arms! That's good, too," cried Brown; "Suppose they say one thing to
 you, and do the other thing to me." He calmed down markedly. "I dare say
 you have the power, or what's the meaning of all this talk?" he continued.
 "What did you come down here for? To pass the time of day?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Very well," said Jim, lifting his head suddenly after a long silence.
 "You shall have a clear road or else a clear fight." He turned on his heel
 and walked away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Brown got up at once, but he did not go up the hill till he had seen Jim
 disappear between the first houses. He never set his eyes on him again. On
 his way back he met Cornelius slouching down with his head between his
 shoulders. He stopped before Brown. "Why didn't you kill him?" he demanded
 in a sour, discontented voice. "Because I could do better than that,"
 Brown said with an amused smile. "Never! never!" protested Cornelius with
 energy. "Couldn't. I have lived here for many years." Brown looked up at
 him curiously. There were many sides to the life of that place in arms
 against him; things he would never find out. Cornelius slunk past
 dejectedly in the direction of the river. He was now leaving his new
 friends; he accepted the disappointing course of events with a sulky
 obstinacy which seemed to draw more together his little yellow old face;
 and as he went down he glanced askant here and there, never giving up his
 fixed idea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Henceforth events move fast without a check, flowing from the very hearts
 of men like a stream from a dark source, and we see Jim amongst them,
 mostly through Tamb' Itam's eyes. The girl's eyes had watched him too, but
 her life is too much entwined with his: there is her passion, her wonder,
 her anger, and, above all, her fear and her unforgiving love. Of the
 faithful servant, uncomprehending as the rest of them, it is the fidelity
 alone that comes into play; a fidelity and a belief in his lord so strong
 that even amazement is subdued to a sort of saddened acceptance of a
 mysterious failure. He has eyes only for one figure, and through all the
 mazes of bewilderment he preserves his air of guardianship, of obedience,
 of care.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'His master came back from his talk with the white men, walking slowly
 towards the stockade in the street. Everybody was rejoiced to see him
 return, for while he was away every man had been afraid not only of him
 being killed, but also of what would come after. Jim went into one of the
 houses, where old Doramin had retired, and remained alone for a long time
 with the head of the Bugis settlers. No doubt he discussed the course to
 follow with him then, but no man was present at the conversation. Only
 Tamb' Itam, keeping as close to the door as he could, heard his master
 say, "Yes. I shall let all the people know that such is my wish; but I
 spoke to you, O Doramin, before all the others, and alone; for you know my
 heart as well as I know yours and its greatest desire. And you know well
 also that I have no thought but for the people's good." Then his master,
 lifting the sheeting in the doorway, went out, and he, Tamb' Itam, had a
 glimpse of old Doramin within, sitting in the chair with his hands on his
 knees, and looking between his feet. Afterwards he followed his master to
 the fort, where all the principal Bugis and Patusan inhabitants had been
 summoned for a talk. Tamb' Itam himself hoped there would be some
 fighting. "What was it but the taking of another hill?" he exclaimed
 regretfully. However, in the town many hoped that the rapacious strangers
 would be induced, by the sight of so many brave men making ready to fight,
 to go away. It would be a good thing if they went away. Since Jim's
 arrival had been made known before daylight by the gun fired from the fort
 and the beating of the big drum there, the fear that had hung over Patusan
 had broken and subsided like a wave on a rock, leaving the seething foam
 of excitement, curiosity, and endless speculation. Half of the population
 had been ousted out of their homes for purposes of defence, and were
 living in the street on the left side of the river, crowding round the
 fort, and in momentary expectation of seeing their abandoned dwellings on
 the threatened bank burst into flames. The general anxiety was to see the
 matter settled quickly. Food, through Jewel's care, had been served out to
 the refugees. Nobody knew what their white man would do. Some remarked
 that it was worse than in Sherif Ali's war. Then many people did not care;
 now everybody had something to lose. The movements of canoes passing to
 and fro between the two parts of the town were watched with interest. A
 couple of Bugis war-boats lay anchored in the middle of the stream to
 protect the river, and a thread of smoke stood at the bow of each; the men
 in them were cooking their midday rice when Jim, after his interviews with
 Brown and Doramin, crossed the river and entered by the water-gate of his
 fort. The people inside crowded round him, so that he could hardly make
 his way to the house. They had not seen him before, because on his arrival
 during the night he had only exchanged a few words with the girl, who had
 come down to the landing-stage for the purpose, and had then gone on at
 once to join the chiefs and the fighting men on the other bank. People
 shouted greetings after him. One old woman raised a laugh by pushing her
 way to the front madly and enjoining him in a scolding voice to see to it
 that her two sons, who were with Doramin, did not come to harm at the
 hands of the robbers. Several of the bystanders tried to pull her away,
 but she struggled and cried, "Let me go. What is this, O Muslims? This
 laughter is unseemly. Are they not cruel, bloodthirsty robbers bent on
 killing?" "Let her be," said Jim, and as a silence fell suddenly, he said
 slowly, "Everybody shall be safe." He entered the house before the great
 sigh, and the loud murmurs of satisfaction, had died out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'There's no doubt his mind was made up that Brown should have his way
 clear back to the sea. His fate, revolted, was forcing his hand. He had
 for the first time to affirm his will in the face of outspoken opposition.
 "There was much talk, and at first my master was silent," Tamb' Itam said.
 "Darkness came, and then I lit the candles on the long table. The chiefs
 sat on each side, and the lady remained by my master's right hand."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'When he began to speak, the unaccustomed difficulty seemed only to fix
 his resolve more immovably. The white men were now waiting for his answer
 on the hill. Their chief had spoken to him in the language of his own
 people, making clear many things difficult to explain in any other speech.
 They were erring men whom suffering had made blind to right and wrong. It
 is true that lives had been lost already, but why lose more? He declared
 to his hearers, the assembled heads of the people, that their welfare was
 his welfare, their losses his losses, their mourning his mourning. He
 looked round at the grave listening faces and told them to remember that
 they had fought and worked side by side. They knew his courage . . . Here
 a murmur interrupted him . . . And that he had never deceived them. For
 many years they had dwelt together. He loved the land and the people
 living in it with a very great love. He was ready to answer with his life
 for any harm that should come to them if the white men with beards were
 allowed to retire. They were evil-doers, but their destiny had been evil,
 too. Had he ever advised them ill? Had his words ever brought suffering to
 the people? he asked. He believed that it would be best to let these
 whites and their followers go with their lives. It would be a small gift.
 "I whom you have tried and found always true ask you to let them go." He
 turned to Doramin. The old nakhoda made no movement. "Then," said Jim,
 "call in Dain Waris, your son, my friend, for in this business I shall not
 lead."'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 43
 </h2>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam behind his chair was thunderstruck. The declaration produced
 an immense sensation. "Let them go because this is best in my knowledge
 which has never deceived you," Jim insisted. There was a silence. In the
 darkness of the courtyard could be heard the subdued whispering, shuffling
 noise of many people. Doramin raised his heavy head and said that there
 was no more reading of hearts than touching the sky with the hand, but?he
 consented. The others gave their opinion in turn. "It is best," "Let them
 go," and so on. But most of them simply said that they "believed Tuan
 Jim."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'In this simple form of assent to his will lies the whole gist of the
 situation; their creed, his truth; and the testimony to that faithfulness
 which made him in his own eyes the equal of the impeccable men who never
 fall out of the ranks. Stein's words, "Romantic!?Romantic!" seem to
 ring over those distances that will never give him up now to a world
 indifferent to his failings and his virtues, and to that ardent and
 clinging affection that refuses him the dole of tears in the bewilderment
 of a great grief and of eternal separation. From the moment the sheer
 truthfulness of his last three years of life carries the day against the
 ignorance, the fear, and the anger of men, he appears no longer to me as I
 saw him last?a white speck catching all the dim light left upon a
 sombre coast and the darkened sea?but greater and more pitiful in
 the loneliness of his soul, that remains even for her who loved him best a
 cruel and insoluble mystery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It is evident that he did not mistrust Brown; there was no reason to
 doubt the story, whose truth seemed warranted by the rough frankness, by a
 sort of virile sincerity in accepting the morality and the consequences of
 his acts. But Jim did not know the almost inconceivable egotism of the man
 which made him, when resisted and foiled in his will, mad with the
 indignant and revengeful rage of a thwarted autocrat. But if Jim did not
 mistrust Brown, he was evidently anxious that some misunderstanding should
 not occur, ending perhaps in collision and bloodshed. It was for this
 reason that directly the Malay chiefs had gone he asked Jewel to get him
 something to eat, as he was going out of the fort to take command in the
 town. On her remonstrating against this on the score of his fatigue, he
 said that something might happen for which he would never forgive himself.
 "I am responsible for every life in the land," he said. He was moody at
 first; she served him with her own hands, taking the plates and dishes (of
 the dinner-service presented him by Stein) from Tamb' Itam. He brightened
 up after a while; told her she would be again in command of the fort for
 another night. "There's no sleep for us, old girl," he said, "while our
 people are in danger." Later on he said jokingly that she was the best man
 of them all. "If you and Dain Waris had done what you wanted, not one of
 these poor devils would be alive to-day." "Are they very bad?" she asked,
 leaning over his chair. "Men act badly sometimes without being much worse
 than others," he said after some hesitation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam followed his master to the landing-stage outside the fort. The
 night was clear but without a moon, and the middle of the river was dark,
 while the water under each bank reflected the light of many fires "as on a
 night of Ramadan," Tamb' Itam said. War-boats drifted silently in the dark
 lane or, anchored, floated motionless with a loud ripple. That night there
 was much paddling in a canoe and walking at his master's heels for Tamb'
 Itam: up and down the street they tramped, where the fires were burning,
 inland on the outskirts of the town where small parties of men kept guard
 in the fields. Tuan Jim gave his orders and was obeyed. Last of all they
 went to the Rajah's stockade, which a detachment of Jim's people manned on
 that night. The old Rajah had fled early in the morning with most of his
 women to a small house he had near a jungle village on a tributary stream.
 Kassim, left behind, had attended the council with his air of diligent
 activity to explain away the diplomacy of the day before. He was
 considerably cold-shouldered, but managed to preserve his smiling, quiet
 alertness, and professed himself highly delighted when Jim told him
 sternly that he proposed to occupy the stockade on that night with his own
 men. After the council broke up he was heard outside accosting this and
 that deputing chief, and speaking in a loud, gratified tone of the Rajah's
 property being protected in the Rajah's absence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'About ten or so Jim's men marched in. The stockade commanded the mouth of
 the creek, and Jim meant to remain there till Brown had passed below. A
 small fire was lit on the flat, grassy point outside the wall of stakes,
 and Tamb' Itam placed a little folding-stool for his master. Jim told him
 to try and sleep. Tamb' Itam got a mat and lay down a little way off; but
 he could not sleep, though he knew he had to go on an important journey
 before the night was out. His master walked to and fro before the fire
 with bowed head and with his hands behind his back. His face was sad.
 Whenever his master approached him Tamb' Itam pretended to sleep, not
 wishing his master to know he had been watched. At last his master stood
 still, looking down on him as he lay, and said softly, "It is time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam arose directly and made his preparations. His mission was to
 go down the river, preceding Brown's boat by an hour or more, to tell Dain
 Waris finally and formally that the whites were to be allowed to pass out
 unmolested. Jim would not trust anybody else with that service. Before
 starting, Tamb' Itam, more as a matter of form (since his position about
 Jim made him perfectly known), asked for a token. "Because, Tuan," he
 said, "the message is important, and these are thy very words I carry."
 His master first put his hand into one pocket, then into another, and
 finally took off his forefinger Stein's silver ring, which he habitually
 wore, and gave it to Tamb' Itam. When Tamb' Itam left on his mission,
 Brown's camp on the knoll was dark but for a single small glow shining
 through the branches of one of the trees the white men had cut down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Early in the evening Brown had received from Jim a folded piece of paper
 on which was written, "You get the clear road. Start as soon as your boat
 floats on the morning tide. Let your men be careful. The bushes on both
 sides of the creek and the stockade at the mouth are full of well-armed
 men. You would have no chance, but I don't believe you want bloodshed."
 Brown read it, tore the paper into small pieces, and, turning to
 Cornelius, who had brought it, said jeeringly, "Good-bye, my excellent
 friend." Cornelius had been in the fort, and had been sneaking around
 Jim's house during the afternoon. Jim chose him to carry the note because
 he could speak English, was known to Brown, and was not likely to be shot
 by some nervous mistake of one of the men as a Malay, approaching in the
 dusk, perhaps might have been.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Cornelius didn't go away after delivering the paper. Brown was sitting up
 over a tiny fire; all the others were lying down. "I could tell you
 something you would like to know," Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid
 no attention. "You did not kill him," went on the other, "and what do you
 get for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the loot of
 all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing." "You had better clear out
 from here," growled Brown, without even looking at him. But Cornelius let
 himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast, touching his
 elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit up at first,
 with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's armed party down
 the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold and betrayed, but a
 moment's reflection convinced him that there could be no treachery
 intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius remarked, in a tone
 of complete indifference, that there was another way out of the river
 which he knew very well. "A good thing to know, too," said Brown, pricking
 up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of what went on in town and
 repeated all that had been said in council, gossiping in an even undertone
 at Brown's ear as you talk amongst sleeping men you do not wish to wake.
 "He thinks he has made me harmless, does he?" mumbled Brown very low. . .
 . "Yes. He is a fool. A little child. He came here and robbed me," droned
 on Cornelius, "and he made all the people believe him. But if something
 happened that they did not believe him any more, where would he be? And
 the Bugis Dain who is waiting for you down the river there, captain, is
 the very man who chased you up here when you first came." Brown observed
 nonchalantly that it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same
 detached, musing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a
 backwater broad enough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. "You will
 have to be quiet," he said as an afterthought, "for in one place we pass
 close behind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats
 hauled up." "Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear," said
 Brown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his
 canoe should be towed. "I'll have to get back quick," he explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was two hours before the dawn when word was passed to the stockade
 from outlying watchers that the white robbers were coming down to their
 boat. In a very short time every armed man from one end of Patusan to the
 other was on the alert, yet the banks of the river remained so silent that
 but for the fires burning with sudden blurred flares the town might have
 been asleep as if in peace-time. A heavy mist lay very low on the water,
 making a sort of illusive grey light that showed nothing. When Brown's
 long-boat glided out of the creek into the river, Jim was standing on the
 low point of land before the Rajah's stockade?on the very spot where
 for the first time he put his foot on Patusan shore. A shadow loomed up,
 moving in the greyness, solitary, very bulky, and yet constantly eluding
 the eye. A murmur of low talking came out of it. Brown at the tiller heard
 Jim speak calmly: "A clear road. You had better trust to the current while
 the fog lasts; but this will lift presently." "Yes, presently we shall see
 clear," replied Brown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The thirty or forty men standing with muskets at ready outside the
 stockade held their breath. The Bugis owner of the prau, whom I saw on
 Stein's verandah, and who was amongst them, told me that the boat, shaving
 the low point close, seemed for a moment to grow big and hang over it like
 a mountain. "If you think it worth your while to wait a day outside,"
 called out Jim, "I'll try to send you down something?a bullock, some
 yams?what I can." The shadow went on moving. "Yes. Do," said a
 voice, blank and muffled out of the fog. Not one of the many attentive
 listeners understood what the words meant; and then Brown and his men in
 their boat floated away, fading spectrally without the slightest sound.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus Brown, invisible in the mist, goes out of Patusan elbow to elbow
 with Cornelius in the stern-sheets of the long-boat. "Perhaps you shall
 get a small bullock," said Cornelius. "Oh yes. Bullock. Yam. You'll get it
 if he said so. He always speaks the truth. He stole everything I had. I
 suppose you like a small bullock better than the loot of many houses." "I
 would advise you to hold your tongue, or somebody here may fling you
 overboard into this damned fog," said Brown. The boat seemed to be
 standing still; nothing could be seen, not even the river alongside, only
 the water-dust flew and trickled, condensed, down their beards and faces.
 It was weird, Brown told me. Every individual man of them felt as though
 he were adrift alone in a boat, haunted by an almost imperceptible
 suspicion of sighing, muttering ghosts. "Throw me out, would you? But I
 would know where I was," mumbled Cornelius surlily. "I've lived many years
 here." "Not long enough to see through a fog like this," Brown said,
 lolling back with his arm swinging to and fro on the useless tiller. "Yes.
 Long enough for that," snarled Cornelius. "That's very useful," commented
 Brown. "Am I to believe you could find that backway you spoke of
 blindfold, like this?" Cornelius grunted. "Are you too tired to row?" he
 asked after a silence. "No, by God!" shouted Brown suddenly. "Out with
 your oars there." There was a great knocking in the fog, which after a
 while settled into a regular grind of invisible sweeps against invisible
 thole-pins. Otherwise nothing was changed, and but for the slight splash
 of a dipped blade it was like rowing a balloon car in a cloud, said Brown.
 Thereafter Cornelius did not open his lips except to ask querulously for
 somebody to bale out his canoe, which was towing behind the long-boat.
 Gradually the fog whitened and became luminous ahead. To the left Brown
 saw a darkness as though he had been looking at the back of the departing
 night. All at once a big bough covered with leaves appeared above his
 head, and ends of twigs, dripping and still, curved slenderly close
 alongside. Cornelius, without a word, took the tiller from his hand.'

 CHAPTER 44
 </h2>
 <p>
 'I don't think they spoke together again. The boat entered a narrow
 by-channel, where it was pushed by the oar-blades set into crumbling
 banks, and there was a gloom as if enormous black wings had been outspread
 above the mist that filled its depth to the summits of the trees. The
 branches overhead showered big drops through the gloomy fog. At a mutter
 from Cornelius, Brown ordered his men to load. "I'll give you a chance to
 get even with them before we're done, you dismal cripples, you," he said
 to his gang. "Mind you don't throw it away?you hounds." Low growls
 answered that speech. Cornelius showed much fussy concern for the safety
 of his canoe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Meantime Tamb' Itam had reached the end of his journey. The fog had
 delayed him a little, but he had paddled steadily, keeping in touch with
 the south bank. By-and-by daylight came like a glow in a ground glass
 globe. The shores made on each side of the river a dark smudge, in which
 one could detect hints of columnar forms and shadows of twisted branches
 high up. The mist was still thick on the water, but a good watch was being
 kept, for as Iamb' Itam approached the camp the figures of two men emerged
 out of the white vapour, and voices spoke to him boisterously. He
 answered, and presently a canoe lay alongside, and he exchanged news with
 the paddlers. All was well. The trouble was over. Then the men in the
 canoe let go their grip on the side of his dug-out and incontinently fell
 out of sight. He pursued his way till he heard voices coming to him
 quietly over the water, and saw, under the now lifting, swirling mist, the
 glow of many little fires burning on a sandy stretch, backed by lofty thin
 timber and bushes. There again a look-out was kept, for he was challenged.
 He shouted his name as the two last sweeps of his paddle ran his canoe up
 on the strand. It was a big camp. Men crouched in many little knots under
 a subdued murmur of early morning talk. Many thin threads of smoke curled
 slowly on the white mist. Little shelters, elevated above the ground, had
 been built for the chiefs. Muskets were stacked in small pyramids, and
 long spears were stuck singly into the sand near the fires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam, assuming an air of importance, demanded to be led to Dain
 Waris. He found the friend of his white lord lying on a raised couch made
 of bamboo, and sheltered by a sort of shed of sticks covered with mats.
 Dain Waris was awake, and a bright fire was burning before his
 sleeping-place, which resembled a rude shrine. The only son of nakhoda
 Doramin answered his greeting kindly. Tamb' Itam began by handing him the
 ring which vouched for the truth of the messenger's words. Dain Waris,
 reclining on his elbow, bade him speak and tell all the news. Beginning
 with the consecrated formula, "The news is good," Tamb' Itam delivered
 Jim's own words. The white men, deputing with the consent of all the
 chiefs, were to be allowed to pass down the river. In answer to a question
 or two Tamb' Itam then reported the proceedings of the last council. Dain
 Waris listened attentively to the end, toying with the ring which
 ultimately he slipped on the forefinger of his right hand. After hearing
 all he had to say he dismissed Tamb' Itam to have food and rest. Orders
 for the return in the afternoon were given immediately. Afterwards Dain
 Waris lay down again, open-eyed, while his personal attendants were
 preparing his food at the fire, by which Tamb' Itam also sat talking to
 the men who lounged up to hear the latest intelligence from the town. The
 sun was eating up the mist. A good watch was kept upon the reach of the
 main stream where the boat of the whites was expected to appear every
 moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which, after
 twenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying, refused him the
 tribute of a common robber's success. It was an act of cold-blooded
 ferocity, and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an
 indomitable defiance. Stealthily he landed his men on the other side of
 the island opposite to the Bugis camp, and led them across. After a short
 but quite silent scuffle, Cornelius, who had tried to slink away at the
 moment of landing, resigned himself to show the way where the undergrowth
 was most sparse. Brown held both his skinny hands together behind his back
 in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled him forward with a
 fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish, abject but faithful to
 his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before him dimly. At the edge of
 the patch of forest Brown's men spread themselves out in cover and waited.
 The camp was plain from end to end before their eyes, and no one looked
 their way. Nobody even dreamed that the white men could have any knowledge
 of the narrow channel at the back of the island. When he judged the moment
 come, Brown yelled, "Let them have it," and fourteen shots rang out like
 one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam told me the surprise was so great that, except for those who
 fell dead or wounded, not a soul of them moved for quite an appreciable
 time after the first discharge. Then a man screamed, and after that scream
 a great yell of amazement and fear went up from all the throats. A blind
 panic drove these men in a surging swaying mob to and fro along the shore
 like a herd of cattle afraid of the water. Some few jumped into the river
 then, but most of them did so only after the last discharge. Three times
 Brown's men fired into the ruck, Brown, the only one in view, cursing and
 yelling, "Aim low! aim low!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam says that, as for him, he understood at the first volley what
 had happened. Though untouched he fell down and lay as if dead, but with
 his eyes open. At the sound of the first shots Dain Waris, reclining on
 the couch, jumped up and ran out upon the open shore, just in time to
 receive a bullet in his forehead at the second discharge. Tamb' Itam saw
 him fling his arms wide open before he fell. Then, he says, a great fear
 came upon him?not before. The white men retired as they had come?unseen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Thus Brown balanced his account with the evil fortune. Notice that even
 in this awful outbreak there is a superiority as of a man who carries
 right?the abstract thing?within the envelope of his common
 desires. It was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a
 retribution?a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of
 our nature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we
 like to think.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Afterwards the whites depart unseen by Tamb' Itam, and seem to vanish
 from before men's eyes altogether; and the schooner, too, vanishes after
 the manner of stolen goods. But a story is told of a white long-boat
 picked up a month later in the Indian Ocean by a cargo steamer. Two
 parched, yellow, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons in her recognised the
 authority of a third, who declared that his name was Brown. His schooner,
 he reported, bound south with a cargo of Java sugar, had sprung a bad leak
 and sank under his feet. He and his companions were the survivors of a
 crew of six. The two died on board the steamer which rescued them. Brown
 lived to be seen by me, and I can testify that he had played his part to
 the last.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It seems, however, that in going away they had neglected to cast off
 Cornelius's canoe. Cornelius himself Brown had let go at the beginning of
 the shooting, with a kick for a parting benediction. Tamb' Itam, after
 arising from amongst the dead, saw the Nazarene running up and down the
 shore amongst the corpses and the expiring fires. He uttered little cries.
 Suddenly he rushed to the water, and made frantic efforts to get one of
 the Bugis boats into the water. "Afterwards, till he had seen me," related
 Tamb' Itam, "he stood looking at the heavy canoe and scratching his head."
 "What became of him?" I asked. Tamb' Itam, staring hard at me, made an
 expressive gesture with his right arm. "Twice I struck, Tuan," he said.
 "When he beheld me approaching he cast himself violently on the ground and
 made a great outcry, kicking. He screeched like a frightened hen till he
 felt the point; then he was still, and lay staring at me while his life
 went out of his eyes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'This done, Tamb' Itam did not tarry. He understood the importance of
 being the first with the awful news at the fort. There were, of course,
 many survivors of Dain Waris's party; but in the extremity of panic some
 had swum across the river, others had bolted into the bush. The fact is
 that they did not know really who struck that blow?whether more
 white robbers were not coming, whether they had not already got hold of
 the whole land. They imagined themselves to be the victims of a vast
 treachery, and utterly doomed to destruction. It is said that some small
 parties did not come in till three days afterwards. However, a few tried
 to make their way back to Patusan at once, and one of the canoes that were
 patrolling the river that morning was in sight of the camp at the very
 moment of the attack. It is true that at first the men in her leaped
 overboard and swam to the opposite bank, but afterwards they returned to
 their boat and started fearfully up-stream. Of these Tamb' Itam had an
 hour's advance.'

 <h2>
 CHAPTER 45
 </h2>
 <p>
 'When Tamb' Itam, paddling madly, came into the town-reach, the women,
 thronging the platforms before the houses, were looking out for the return
 of Dain Waris's little fleet of boats. The town had a festive air; here
 and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could be seen
 moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had been
 opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still posted
 at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to those
 within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran in
 headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes, stood
 for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him. Then he
 broke out very quickly: "They have killed Dain Waris and many more." She
 clapped her hands, and her first words were, "Shut the gates." Most of the
 fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb' Itam hurried on the few
 who remained for their turn of duty within. The girl stood in the middle
 of the courtyard while the others ran about. "Doramin," she cried
 despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time he went by he answered
 her thought rapidly, "Yes. But we have all the powder in Patusan." She
 caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the house, "Call him out," she
 whispered, trembling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. "It is I, Tamb'
 Itam," he cried at the door, "with tidings that cannot wait." He saw Jim
 turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at once.
 "This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day." His master raised himself
 on his elbow to listen?just as Dain Waris had done. And then Tamb'
 Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling Dain
 Waris Panglima, and saying: "The Panglima then called out to the chief of
 his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'"?when his master
 put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a discomposed face
 that the words remained in his throat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Speak out," said Jim. "Is he dead?" "May you live long," cried Tamb'
 Itam. "It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and
 fell." . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck at
 the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but
 speaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats
 for immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other?send messengers;
 and as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots
 hurriedly, and suddenly looked up. "Why do you stand here?" he asked very
 red-faced. "Waste no time." Tamb' Itam did not move. "Forgive me, Tuan,
 but . . . but," he began to stammer. "What?" cried his master aloud,
 looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the edge of the
 bed. "It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the people," said
 Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small matter
 of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own hands, had
 fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his servant to go out
 amongst his own people! I believe that in that very moment he had decided
 to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred to him such a disaster
 could be defied; but all I know is that, without a word, he came out of
 his room and sat before the long table, at the head of which he was
 accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world, proclaiming daily the
 truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark powers should not rob him
 twice of his peace. He sat like a stone figure. Tamb' Itam, deferential,
 hinted at preparations for defence. The girl he loved came in and spoke to
 him, but he made a sign with his hand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal
 for silence in it. She went out on the verandah and sat on the threshold,
 as if to guard him with her body from dangers outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'What thoughts passed through his head?what memories? Who can tell?
 Everything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust had
 lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried to write?to
 somebody?and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him. People had
 trusted him with their lives?only for that; and yet they could
 never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those without did
 not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he came to the door
 and called for Tamb' Itam. "Well?" he asked. "There is much weeping. Much
 anger too," said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him. "You know," he
 murmured. "Yes, Tuan," said Tamb' Itam. "Thy servant does know, and the
 gates are closed. We shall have to fight." "Fight! What for?" he asked.
 "For our lives." "I have no life," he said. Tamb' Itam heard a cry from
 the girl at the door. "Who knows?" said Tamb' Itam. "By audacity and
 cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's hearts too." He
 went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea, leaving Jim and the
 girl together.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given me of
 the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the possession
 of her happiness. Whether he had any hope?what he expected, what he
 imagined?it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with the
 growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above the
 ruins of his existence. She cried "Fight!" into his ear. She could not
 understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove his
 power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came out
 into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild of face,
 breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the doorway. "Open
 the gates," he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of his men who were
 inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes. "For how long, Tuan?"
 asked one of them timidly. "For all life," he said, in a sombre tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and
 lamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the
 opened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts
 with consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,
 bringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no
 refuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during an
 earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,
 looking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was
 brought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently
 with a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to
 meet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old
 man sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The
 fronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred
 above his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,
 when the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over
 the crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his
 breast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the
 leaves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there
 too. "Not so angry as many," he said to me, but struck with a great awe
 and wonder at the "suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their heads
 like a cloud charged with thunder." He told me that when Dain Waris's body
 was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often called the white
 lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his eyelids a little open
 as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a little more, like one
 looking for something fallen on the ground. His eyes searched the body
 from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe. It was in the forehead and
 small; and there was no word spoken while one of the by-standers,
 stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold stiff hand. In silence he
 held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay and horror ran through the
 crowd at the sight of that familiar token. The old nakhoda stared at it,
 and suddenly let out one great fierce cry, deep from the chest, a roar of
 pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of a wounded bull, bringing great
 fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude of his anger and his sorrow that
 could be plainly discerned without words. There was a great stillness
 afterwards for a space, while the body was being borne aside by four men.
 They laid it down under a tree, and on the instant, with one long shriek,
 all the women of the household began to wail together; they mourned with
 shrill cries; the sun was setting, and in the intervals of screamed
 lamentations the high sing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran
 chanted alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river, and
 turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting as if
 she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the yard.
 Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for what might
 happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet thought, turned to
 him and said, "Time to finish this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Tuan?" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what
 his master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started too
 and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of the
 people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about
 half-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful
 contemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against the
 gun. "Will you fight?" she cried. "There is nothing to fight for," he
 said; "nothing is lost." Saying this he made a step towards her. "Will you
 fly?" she cried again. "There is no escape," he said, stopping short, and
 she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes. "And you shall
 go?" she said slowly. He bent his head. "Ah!" she exclaimed, peering at
 him as it were, "you are mad or false. Do you remember the night I prayed
 you to leave me, and you said that you could not? That it was impossible!
 Impossible! Do you remember you said you would never leave me? Why? I
 asked you for no promise. You promised unasked?remember." "Enough,
 poor girl," he said. "I should not be worth having."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and
 senselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his hands
 to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without a hat. She
 stopped laughing suddenly. "For the last time," she cried menacingly,
 "will you defend yourself?" "Nothing can touch me," he said in a last
 flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward where she stood,
 open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung herself upon his breast
 and clasped him round the neck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus," she cried. . . . "Thou art mine!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red, immense,
 streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson amongst the
 tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was
 angry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very
 day a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was
 hardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her hands.
 She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the ground.
 "Come here!" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease her down. It
 was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending over her, looked
 earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the landing-stage. Tamb'
 Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw that she had struggled up
 to her feet. She ran after them a few steps, then fell down heavily on her
 knees. "Tuan! Tuan!" called Tamb' Itam, "look back;" but Jim was already
 in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand. He did not look back. Tamb' Itam
 had just time to scramble in after him when the canoe floated clear. The
 girl was then on her knees, with clasped hands, at the water-gate. She
 remained thus for a time in a supplicating attitude before she sprang up.
 "You are false!" she screamed out after Jim. "Forgive me," he cried.
 "Never! Never!" she called back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he
 should sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his
 master forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at a
 distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those
 they met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The
 wailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis
 with their followers, and of Patusan people.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations
 for war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many days
 elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for the return
 of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact relation to
 their own white man they could never understand. Even for those simple
 minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the pair
 of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When Jim
 appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round together,
 and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a lane of
 averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: "He has worked all the
 evil." "He hath a charm." . . . He heard them?perhaps!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women ceased
 suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent before him
 for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that direction with
 measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head of the body, and
 the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came up slowly, looked
 at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it without a word.
 Slowly he walked back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 '"He came! He came!" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to which
 he moved. "He hath taken it upon his own head," a voice said aloud. He
 heard this and turned to the crowd. "Yes. Upon my head." A few people
 recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently, "I am
 come in sorrow." He waited again. "I am come ready and unarmed," he
 repeated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a yoke,
 made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his knees.
 From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his two
 attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring which he
 had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of the white man,
 and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had opened for him the
 door of fame, love, and success within the wall of forests fringed with
 white foam, within the coast that under the western sun looks like the
 very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to keep his feet, made
 with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group; his little eyes stared
 with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with a ferocious glitter, which
 the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim stood stiffened and with bared
 head in the light of torches, looking him straight in the face, he clung
 heavily with his left arm round the neck of a bowed youth, and lifting
 deliberately his right, shot his son's friend through the chest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had
 raised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say that
 the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and
 unflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,
 dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,
 forgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days
 of his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an
 extraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment of
 his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that
 opportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out of
 the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted egoism.
 He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless wedding with a
 shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied?quite, now, I wonder? We
 ought to know. He is one of us?and have I not stood up once, like an
 evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very wrong
 after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of his
 existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force; and yet
 upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my eyes like a
 disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this earth, ready to
 surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own world of shades.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is leading
 a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has aged greatly
 of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is "preparing to
 leave all this; preparing to leave . . ." while he waves his hand sadly at
 his butterflies.'

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
