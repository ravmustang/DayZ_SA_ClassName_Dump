 <h2>
 CHAPTER I. WHEN GREEN GRASS COMES
 </h2>
 <p>
 Old Applehead Furrman, jogging home across the mesa from Albuquerque,
 sniffed the soft breeze that came from opal-tinted distances and felt
 poignantly that spring was indeed here. The grass, thick and green in the
 sheltered places, was fast painting all the higher ridges and foot-hill
 slopes, and with the green grass came the lank-bodied, big-kneed calves;
 which meant that roundup time was at hand. Applehead did not own more than
 a thousand head of cattle, counting every hoof that walked under his
 brand. And with the incipient lethargy of old age creeping into his habits
 of life, roundup time was not with him the important season it once had
 been; for several years he had been content to hire a couple of men to
 represent him in the roundups of the larger outfits?men whom he
 could trust to watch fairly well his interests. By that method he avoided
 much trouble and hurry and hard work?and escaped also the cares
 which come with wealth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But this spring was not as other springs had been. Something?whether
 an awakened ambition or an access of sentiment regarding range matters, he
 did not know?was stirring the blood in Applehead's veins. Never,
 since the days when he had been a cowpuncher, had the wide spaces called
 to him so alluringly; never had his mind dwelt so insistently upon the
 approach of spring roundup. Perhaps it was because he heard so much range
 talk at the ranch, where the boys of the Flying U were foregathered in
 uneasy idleness, their fingers itching for the feel of lariat ropes and
 branding irons while they gazed out over the wide spaces of the mesa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So much good rangeland unharnessed by wire fencing the Flying U boys had
 not seen for many a day. During the winter they had been content to ride
 over it merely for the purpose of helping to make a motion picture of the
 range, but with the coming of green grass, and with the reaction that
 followed the completion of the picture that in the making had filled all
 their thoughts, they were not so content. To the inevitable reaction had
 been added a nerve racking period of idleness and uncertainty while Luck
 Lindsay, their director, strove with the Great Western Film Company in Los
 Angeles for terms and prices that would make for the prosperity of himself
 and his company.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In his heart Applehead knew, just as the Happy Family knew, that Luck had
 good and sufficient reasons for over-staying the time-limit he had given
 himself for the trip. But knowing that Luck was not to be blamed for his
 long absence did not lessen their impatience, nor did it stifle the call
 of the wide spaces nor the subtle influence of the winds that blew softly
 over the uplands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time he reached the ranch Applehead had persuaded himself that the
 immediate gathering of his cattle was an imperative duty and that he
 himself must perform it. He could not, he told himself, afford to wait
 around any longer for luck. Maybe when he came Luck would have nothing but
 disappointment for them, Maybe?Luck was so consarned stubborn when
 he got an idea in his head?maybe be wouldn't come to any agreement
 with the Great Western. Maybe they wouldn't offer him enough money, or
 leave him enough freedom in his work; maybe he would "fly back on the
 rope" at the last minute, and come back with nothing accomplished.
 Applehead, with the experience gleaned from the stress of seeing luck
 produce one feature picture without any financial backing whatever and
 without half enough capital, was not looking forward with any enthusiasm
 to another such ordeal. He did not believe, when all was said and done,
 that the Flying U boys would be so terribly eager to repeat the
 performance. He did believe?or he made himself think he believed?that
 the only sensible thing to do right then was to take the boys and go out
 and start a roundup of his own. It wouldn't take long?his cattle
 weren't so badly scattered this year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's Andy at?" he asked Pink, who happened to be leaning boredly over
 the gate when he rode up to the corral. Andy Green, having been left in
 nominal charge of the outfit when Luck left, must be consulted, Applehead
 supposed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Andy? I dunno. He saddled up and rode off somewhere, a while ago," Pink
 answered glumly. "That's more than he'll let any of us fellows do; the way
 he's close-herding us makes me tired! Any news?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ain't ary word from Luck?no word of NO kind. I've about made up my
 mind to take the chuck-wagon to town and stock it with grub, and hit out
 on roundup t'morrer or next day. I don't see as there's any sense in
 setting around here waitin' on Luck and lettin' my own work slide. Chavez
 boys, they started out yest'day, I heard in town. And if I don't git right
 out close onto their heels, I'll likely find myself with a purty light
 crop uh calves, now I'm tellin' yuh!" Applehead, so completely had he come
 under the spell of the soft spring air and the lure of the mesa, actually
 forgot that he had long been in the habit of attending to his calf crop by
 proxy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink's face brightened briefly. Then he remembered why they were being
 kept so close to the ranch, and he grew bored again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What if Luck pulled in before we got back, and wanted us to start work on
 another picture?" he asked, discouraging the idea reluctantly. Pink had
 himself been listening to the call of the wide spaces, and the mere
 mention of roundup had a thrill for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I calc'late my prope'ty is might' nigh as important as Luck's
 pitcher-making," Applehead contended with a selfishness born of his newly
 awakened hunger for the far distances. "And he ain't sent ary word that
 he's coming, or will need you boys immediate. The chances is we could go
 and git back agin before Luck shows up. And if we don't," he argued
 speciously, "he can't blame nobody for not wantin' to set around on their
 haunches all spring waiting for 'im. I'd do a lot fer luck; I've DONE a
 lot fer 'im. But it ain't to be expected I'd set around waitin' on him and
 let them danged Mexicans rustle my calves. They'll do it if they git half
 a show?now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink did not say anything at all, either in assent or argument; but old
 Applehead, now that he had established a plausible reason for his sudden
 impulse, went on arguing the case while he unsaddled his horse. By the
 time he turned the animal loose he had thought of two or three other
 reasons why he should take the boys and start out as soon as possible to
 round up his cattle. He was still dilating upon these reasons when Andy
 Green rode slowly down the slope to the corral.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie-Many-Ponies come back yet?" he asked of Pink, as he swung down off
 his horse. "Annie? No; ain't seen anything of her. Shunky's been sitting
 out there on the hill for the last hour, looking for her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fer half a cent," threatened old Applehead, in a bad humor because his
 arguments had not quite convinced him that he was not meditating a
 disloyalty, "I'd kill that danged dawg. And if I was runnin' this bunch,
 I'd send that squaw back where she come from, and I'd send her quick. Take
 the two of 'em together and they don't set good with me, now I'm tellin'
 yuh! If I was to say what I think, I'd say yuh can't never trust an Injun?and
 shiny hair and eyes and slim build don't make 'em no trustier. They's
 something scaley goin' on around here, and I'd gamble on it. And that
 there squaw's at the bottom of it. What fur's she ridin' off every day,
 'n' nobody knowin' where she goes to? If Luck's got the sense he used to
 have, he'll git some white girl to act in his pitchers, and send that
 there squaw home 'fore she double-crosses him some way or other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, hold on, Applehead!" Pink felt constrained to defend the girl.
 "You've got it in for her 'cause her dog don't like your cat. Annie's all
 right; I never saw anything outa the way with her yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, time you're old as I be, you'll have some sense, mebby,"
 Applehead quelled. "Course you think Annie's all right. She's purty,'n'
 purtyness in a woman shore does cover up a pile uh cussedness?to a
 feller under forty. You're boss here, Andy. When she comes back, you ask
 'er where she's been, and see if you kin git a straight answer. She'll lie
 to yuh?I'll bet all I got, she'll lie to yuh. And when a woman lies
 about where she's been to and what she's been doin', you can bet there's
 something scaley goin' on. Yuh can't fool ME!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He turned and went up to the small adobe house where he had lived in
 solitary contentment with his cat Compadre until Luck Lindsay, seeking a
 cheap headquarters for his free-lance company while he produced the big
 Western picture which filled all his mind, had taken calm and unheralded
 possession of the ranch. Applehead did not resent the invasion; on the
 contrary, he welcomed it as a pleasant change in his monotonous existence.
 What he did resent was the coming, first, of the little black dog that was
 no more than a tramp and had no right on the ranch, and that broke all the
 laws of decency and gratitude by making the life of the big blue cat
 miserable. Also he resented the uninvited arrival of Annie-Many-Ponies
 from the Sioux reservation in North Dakota.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies had not only come uninvited?she had remained in
 defiance of Luck's perturbed insistence that she should go back home. The
 Flying U boys might overlook that fact because of her beauty, but
 Applehead was not so easily beguiled?especially when she proceeded
 to form a violent attachment to the little black dog, which she called
 Shunka Chistala in what Applehead considered a brazen flaunting of her
 Indian blood and language, Between the mistress of Shunka Chistala and the
 master of the cat there could never be anything more cordial than an armed
 truce. She had championed that ornery cur in a way to make Applehead's
 blood boil. She had kept the dog in the house at night, which forced the
 cat to seek cold comfort elsewhere. She had pilfered the choicest table
 scraps for the dog?and Compadre was a cat of fastidious palate and
 grew thin on what coarse bits were condescendingly left for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead had not approved of Luck's final consent that Annie-Many-Ponies
 should stay and play the Indian girl in his big picture. In the mind of
 Applehead there lurked a grudge that found all the more room to grow
 because of the natural bigness and generosity of his nature. It irked him
 to see her going her calm way with that proud uptilt to her shapely head
 and that little, inscrutable smile when she caught the meaning of his
 grumbling hints.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead was easy-going to a fault in most things, but his dislike had
 grown in Luck's absence to the point where he considered himself aggrieved
 whenever Annie-Many-Ponies saddled the horse which had been tacitly set
 aside for her use, and rode off into the mesa without a word of
 explanation or excuse. Applehead reminded the boys that she had not acted
 like that when luck was home. She had stayed on the ranch where she
 belonged, except once or twice, on particularly fine days, when she had
 meekly asked "Wagalexa Conka," as she persisted in calling Luck, for
 permission to go for a ride.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead itched to tell her a few things about the social, moral,
 intellectual and economic status of an "Injun squaw"?but there was
 something in her eye, something in the quiver of her finely shaped
 nostrils, in the straight black brows, that held his tongue quiet when he
 met her face to face. You couldn't tell about these squaws. Even luck, who
 knew Indians better than most?and was, in a heathenish tribal way,
 the adopted son of Old Chief Big Turkey, and therefore Annie's brother by
 adoption?even Luck maintained that Annie-Many-Ponies undoubtedly
 carried a knife concealed in her clothes and would use it if ever the need
 arose. Applehead was not afraid of Annie's knife. It was something else,
 something he could not put into words, that held him back from open
 upbraidings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He gave Andy's wife, Rosemary, the mail and stopped to sympathize with her
 because Annie-Many-Ponies had gone away and left the hardest part of the
 ironing undone. Luck had told Annie to help Rosemary with the work; but
 Annie's help, when Luck was not around the place, was, Rosemary asserted,
 purely theoretical.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And from all you read about Indians," Rosemary complained with a pretty
 wrinkling of her brows, "you'd think the women just LIVE for the sake of
 working. I've lost all faith in history, Mr. Furrman. I don't believe
 squaws ever do anything if they can help it. Before she went off riding
 today, for instance, that girl spent a whole HOUR brushing her hair and
 braiding it. And I do believe she GREASES it to make it shine the way it
 does! And the powder she piles on her face?just to ride out on the
 mesa!" Rosemary Green was naturally sweet-tempered and exceedingly
 charitable in her judgements; but here, too, the cat-and-dog feud had its
 influence. Rosemary Green was a loyal champion of the cat Compadre;
 besides, there was a succession of little irritations, in the way of
 dishes left unwashed and inconspicuous corners left unswept, to warp her
 opinion of Annie-Many-Ponies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he left Rosemary he went straight down to where the chuck-wagon
 stood, and began to tap the tires with a small rock to see if they would
 need resetting before he started out. He decided that the brake-blocks
 would have to be replaced with new ones?or at least reshod with old
 boot-soles. The tongue was cracked, too; that had been done last winter
 when Luck was producing The Phantom Herd and had sent old Dave Wiswell
 down a rocky hillside with half-broken bronks harnessed to the wagon, in a
 particularly dramatic scene. Applehead went grumblingly in search of some
 baling wire to wrap the tongue. He had been terribly excited and full of
 enthusiasm for the picture at the time the tongue was cracked, but now he
 looked upon it merely as a vital weakness in his roundup outfit. A new
 tongue would mean delay; and delay, in his present mood, was tragedy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He couldn't find any old baling wire, though he had long been accustomed
 to tangling his feet in snarled bunches of it when he went forth in the
 dark after a high wind. Until now he had not observed its unwonted absence
 from the yard. For a long while he had not needed any wire to mend things,
 because Luck had attended to everything about the ranch, and if anything
 needed mending he had set one of the Happy Family at the task.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His search led him out beyond the corrals in the little dry wash that
 sometimes caught and held what the high winds brought rolling that way.
 The wash was half filled with tumble-weed, so that Applehead was forced to
 get down into it and kick the weeds aside to see if there was any wire
 lodged beneath. His temper did not sweeten over the task, especially since
 he found nothing that he wanted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, riding surreptitiously up the dry wash?meaning to
 come out in a farther gully and so approach the corral from the west
 instead of from the east?came upon Applehead quite unexpectedly. She
 stopped and eyed him aslant from under her level, finely marked brows, and
 her eyes lightened with relief when she saw that Applehead looked more
 startled than she had felt. Indeed, Applehead had been calling Luck
 uncomplimentary names for cleaning the place of everything a man might
 need in a hurry, and he was ashamed of himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't find a foot of danged wire on the danged place!" Applehead kicked a
 large, tangled bunch of weeds under the very nose of the horse which
 jumped sidewise. "Never seen such a maniac for puttin' things where a
 feller can't find 'em, as what Luck is." He was not actually speak ing to
 Annie-Many-Ponies?or if he was he did not choose to point his
 remarks by glancing at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wagalexa Conka, he heap careful for things belong when they stay,"
 Annie-Many-Ponies observed in her musical contralto voice which always
 irritated Applehead with its very melody. "I think plenty wire all fold up
 neat in prop-room. Wagalexa Conka, he all time clean this studio from
 trash lie around everywhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He does, hey?" Applehead's sunburnt mustache bristled like the whiskers
 of Compadre when he was snarling defiance at the little black dog. The
 feud was asserting itself. "Well, this here danged place ain't no studio!
 It's a ranch, and it b'longs to ME, Nip Furrman. And any balin' wire on
 this ranch is my balin' wire, and it's got a right to lay around wherever
 I want it t' lay. And I don't need no danged squaw givin' me hints about
 'how my place oughta be kept?now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not reply in words. She sat on her horse, straight
 as any young warchief that ever led her kinsmen to battle, and looked down
 at Applehead with that maddening half smile of hers, inscrutable as the
 Sphinx her features sometimes resembled. Shunka Chistala (which is Sioux
 for Little Dog) came bounding over the low ridge that hid the ranch
 buildings from sight, and wagged himself dislocatingly up to her.
 Annie-Many-Ponies frowned at his approach until she saw that Applehead was
 aiming a clod at the dog, whereupon she touched her heels to the horse and
 sent him between Applehead and her pet, and gave Shunka Chistala a sharp
 command in Sioux that sent him back to the house with his tail dropped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a full half minute she and old Applehead looked at each other in open
 antagonism. For a squaw, Annie-Many-Ponies was remarkably unsubmissive in
 her bearing. Her big eyes were frankly hostile; her half smile was, in the
 opinion of Applehead, almost as frankly scornful. He could not match her
 in the subtleties of feminine warfare. He took refuge behind the masculine
 bulwark of authority.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where yuh bin with that horse uh mine?" he demanded harshly. "Purty note
 when I don't git no say about my own stock. Got him all het up and heavin'
 like he'd been runnin' cattle; I ain't goin' to stand for havin' my horses
 ran to death, now I'm tellin' yuh! Fer a squaw, I must say you're gittin'
 too danged uppish in your ways around here. Next time you want to go
 traipsin' around the mesa, you kin go afoot. I'm goin' to need my horses
 fer roundup."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A white girl would have made some angry retort; but Annie-Many-Ponies,
 without looking in the least abashed, held her peace and kept that little
 inscrutable smile upon her lips. Her eyes, however, narrowed in their
 gaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yuh hear me?" Poor old Applehead had never before attempted to browbeat a
 woman, and her unsubmissive silence seemed to his bachelor mind uncanny.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hear what Wagalexa Conka tell me." She turned her horse and rode
 composedly away from him over the ridge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll hear a danged sight more'n that, now I'm tellin' yuh!" raved
 Applehead impotently. "I ain't sayin' nothin' agin Luck, but they's goin'
 to be some danged plain speakin' done on some subjects when he comes back,
 and given' squaws a free rein and lettin' 'em ride rough-shod over
 everybody and everything is one of 'era. Things is gittin' mighty funny
 when a danged squaw kin straddle my horses and ride 'em to death, and sass
 me when I say a word agin it?now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went mumbling rebellion that was merely the effervescing of a mood
 which would pass with the words it bred, to the store-room which
 Annie-Many-Ponies had called the prop-room. He found there, piled upon a
 crude shelf, many little bundles of wire folded neatly and with the outer
 end wound twice around to keep each bundle separate from the others.
 Applehead snorted at what he chose to consider a finicky streak in his
 secret idol, Luck Lindsay; but he took two of the little bundles and went
 and wired the wagon tongue. And in the work he found a salve of
 anticipatory pleasure, so that he ended the task to the humming of the
 tune he had heard a movie theatre playing in town as he rode by on his way
 home.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER II. THE DAUGHTER OF A CHIEF
 </h2>
 <p>
 In spite of Andy Green's plea for delay until they knew what Luck meant to
 do, Applehead went on with his energetic preparations for a spring roundup
 of his own. Some perverse spirit seemed to possess him and drive him out
 of his easy-going shiftlessness. He offered to hire the Happy Family by
 the day, since none of them would promise any permanent service until they
 heard from Luck. He put them to work gathering up the saddle-horses that
 had been turned loose when Luck's picture was finished, and repairing
 harness and attending to the numberless details of reorganizing a ranch
 long left to slipshod make-shifts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys of the Flying U argued while they worked, but in spite of
 themselves the lure of the mesa quickened their movements. They were
 supposed to wait for Luck before they did anything; an they all knew that.
 But, on the other hand, Luck was supposed to keep them informed as to his
 movements; which he had not done. They did not voice one single doubt of
 Lucks loyalty to them, but human nature is more prone to suspicion than to
 faith, as every one knows. And Luck had the power and the incentive to
 "double-cross" them if he was the kind to do such a thing. He was manager
 for their little free-lance picture company which did not even have a name
 to call itself by. They had produced one big feature film, and it was
 supposed to be a cooperative affair from start to finish. If Luck failed
 to make good, they would all be broke together. If Luck cleared up the few
 thousands that had been their hope, why?they would all profit by the
 success, if Luck?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 I maintain that they showed themselves of pretty good metal, in that not
 even Happy Tack, confirmed pessimist that he was, ever put the least
 suspicion of Luck's honesty into words. They were not the kind to decry a
 comrade when his back was turned. And they had worked with Luck Lindsay
 and had worked for him. They had slept under the same roof with him, had
 shared his worries, his hopes, and his fears. They did not believe that
 Luck had appropriated the proceeds of The Phantom Herd and had
 deliberately left them there to cool their heels and feel the emptiness of
 their pockets in New Mexico, while he disported himself in Los Angeles;
 they did?not believe that?they would have resented the
 implication that they harbored any doubt of him. But for all that, as the
 days passed and he neither came nor sent them any word, they yielded more
 and more to the determination of Applehead to start out upon his own
 business, and they said less and less about Luck's probable plans for the
 future.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then, just when they were making ready for an early start the next
 morning; just when Applehead had the corral full of horses and his
 chuckwagon of grub; just when the Happy Family had packed their war-bags
 with absolute necessities and were justifying themselves in final
 arguments with Andy Green, who refused point-blank to leave the; ranch?then,
 at the time a dramatist would have chosen for his entrance for an
 effective "curtain," here came Luck, smiling and driving a huge
 seven-passenger machine crowded to the last folding seat and with the
 chauffeur riding on the running board where Luck had calmly banished him
 when he skidded on a sharp turn and came near upsetting them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead, stowing a coil of new rope in the chuck-wagon, took off his hat
 and rubbed his shiny, pink pate in dismay. He was, for the moment, a
 culprit caught in the act of committing a grave misdemeanor if not an
 actual felony. He dropped the rope and went forward with dragging feet?ashamed,
 for the first time in his life, to face a friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck gave the wheel a twist, cut a fine curve around the windmill and
 stopped before the house with as near a flourish as a seven-passenger
 automobile loaded from tail-lamp to windshield can possibly approach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There. That's the way I've been used to seeing cars behave," Luck
 observed pointedly to the deposed chauffeur as he slammed the door open
 and climbed out. "You don't have to act like you're a catepillar on a rail
 fence, to play safe. I believe in keeping all four wheels on the ground?but
 I like to see 'em turn once in awhile. You get me?" He peeled a
 five-dollar banknote off a roll the size of his wrist, handed it to the
 impressed chauffeur and dismissed the transaction with a wave of his
 gloved hand. "You're all right, brother," he tempered his criticism, "but
 I'm some nervous about automobiles."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I noticed that myself," drawled a soft, humorous voice from the rear.
 "This is the nearest I ever came to traveling by telegraph."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck grinned, waved his hand in friendly greeting to the Happy Family who
 were taking long steps up from the corral, and turned his attention to the
 unloading of the machine. "Howdy, folks!?guess yuh thought I'd plumb
 lost the trail back," he called to them over his shoulder while he dove
 after suitcases, packages of various sizes and shapes, a box or two which
 the Happy Family recognized as containing "raw stock," and a camera tripod
 that looked perfectly new.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the congested tonneau a tall, slim young woman managed to descend
 without stepping on anything that could not bear being stepped upon. She
 gave her skirts a little shake, pushed back a flying strand of hair and
 turned her back to the machine that she might the better inspect her
 immediate surroundings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Old Dave Wiswell, the dried little man who never had much to say, peered
 at her sharply, hesitated and then came forward with his bony hand
 outstretched and trembling with eagerness. "Why, my gorry! If it ain't
 Jean Douglas, my eyes are lyin' to me," he cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't Jean Douglas?but don't blame your eyes for that," said the
 girl, taking his hand and shaking it frankly. "Jean Douglas Avery, thanks
 to the law that makes a girl trade her name for a husband. You know Lite,
 of course?dad, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, well?my gorry I I should say I do! Howdy, Aleck?" He shook
 the hand of the old man Jean called dad, and his lips trembled
 uncertainly, seeking speech that would not hurt a very, very sore spot in
 the heart of big Aleck Douglas. "I'm shore glad to meet yuh again," he
 stuttered finally, and let it go at that "And how are yuh, Lite? Just as
 long and lanky as ever?marriage shore ain't fattened you up none. My
 gorry! I shore never expected to see you folks away down here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thought you heard me say when I left that the Great Western had offered
 to get me Jean Douglas for leading lady," Luck put in, looking around
 distractedly for a place to deposit his armload of packages. "That's one
 thing that kept me?waiting for her to show up. Of course a man
 naturally expects a woman to take her own time about starting?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I like that!" Jean drawled. "We broke up housekeeping and wound up a
 ranch and traveled a couple of thousand miles in just a week's time. We?we
 ALMOST hit the same gait you did from town out here today!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rosemary Green came out then, and Luck turned to greet her and to present
 Jean to her, and was pleased when he saw from their eyes that they liked
 each other at first sight. He introduced the Happy Family and Applehead to
 her and to her husband, Lite Avery, and her father. He pulled a skinny
 individual forward and announced that this was Pete Lowry, one of the
 Great Western's crack cameramen; and another chubby, smooth-cheeked young
 man he presented as Tommy Johnson, scenic artist and stage carpenter. And
 he added with a smile for the whole bunch, "We're going to produce some
 real stuff from now on believe me, folks!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the confusion and the mild clamor of the absence-bridging questions and
 hasty answers, two persons had no part. Old Applehead, hard-ridden by the
 uneasy consciousness of his treason to Luck, leaned against a porch post
 and sucked hard at the stem of an empty pipe. And just beyond the corner
 out of sight but well within hearing, Annie-Many-Ponies stood flattened
 against the wall and listened with fast-beating pulse for the sound of her
 name, spoken in the loved voice of Wagalexa Conka. She, the daughter of a
 chief and Luck's sister by tribal adoption?would he not miss her:
 from among those others who welcomed him? Would he not presently ask:
 "Where is Annie-Many-Ponies?" She knew just how he would turn and search
 for her with his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She knew just how his voice would sound when he asked for her. Then, after
 a minute?when he had missed her and had asked for her?she
 would come and stand before him. And he would take her hand and say to
 that white woman; "This is my Indian sister, Annie-Many-Ponies, who played
 the part of the beautiful Indian girl who died so grandly in The Phantom
 Herd. This is the girl who plays my character leads." Then the white girl,
 who was to be his leading woman, would not feel that she was the only
 woman in the company who could do good work for Luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies had worked in pictures since she was fifteen and did
 only "atmosphere stuff" in the Indian camps of Luck's arranging. She was
 wise in the ways of picture jealousies. Already she was jealous of this
 slim woman with the dark hair and eyes and the slow smile that always
 caught one's attention and held it. She waited. She wanted Wagalexa Conka
 to call her in that kindly, imperious voice of his?the voice of the
 master. This leading woman would see, then, that here was a girl more
 beautiful for whom Luck Lindsay felt the affection of family ties.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She waited, flattened against the wall, listening to every word that was
 spoken in that buzzing group. She saw the last bundle taken from the
 machine, and she saw Luck's head and shoulders disappear within the
 tonneau, making sure that it was the last bundle and that nothing had been
 overlooked. She saw the driver climb in, slam the fore-door shut after him
 and bend above the starter. She saw the machine slide out of the group and
 away in a wide circle to regain the trail. She saw the group break and
 start off in various directions as duty or a passing interest led. But
 Wagalexa Conka never once seemed to remember that she was not there. Never
 once did he speak her name.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Instead, just as Rosemary was leading the way into the house, this slim
 young woman they called Jean glanced around inquiringly. "I thought you
 had a squaw working for you," she said in that soft, humorous voice of
 hers. "The one who did the Indian girl in The Phantom Herd. Isn't she here
 any more?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes!" Luck stopped with one foot on the porch. "Sure! Where is Annie?
 Anybody know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She was around here just before you came," said Rosemary carelessly. "I
 don't know where she went."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hid out, I reckon," Luck commented. "Injuns are heap shy of meeting
 strangers. She'll show up after a little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies stooped and slid safely past the window that might
 betray her, and then slipped away behind the house. She waited, and she
 listened; for though the adobe walls were thick, there were open windows
 and her hearing was keen. Within was animated babel and much laughter. But
 not once again did Annie-Many-Ponies hear her name spoken. Not once again
 did Wagalexa Conka remember her. Save when she, that slim woman who bad
 come to play his leads, asked to see her, she had been wholly forgotten.
 Even then she had been named a squaw. It was as though they had been
 speaking of a horse. They did not count her worthy of a place in their
 company, they did not miss her voice and her smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hid out," Wagalexa Conka had said. Well, she would hide out, then?she,
 the daughter of a chief of the Sioux; she, whom Wagalexa Conka had been
 glad to have in his picture when he was poor and had no money to pay white
 leading women. But now he had much money; now he could come in a big
 automobile, with a slim, white leading woman and a camera man and scenic
 artist and much money in his pocket; and she?she was just a squaw
 who had hid out, and who would show up after a while and be grateful if he
 took her by the hand and said, "How!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With so many persons moving eagerly here and there, none but an Indian
 could have slipped away from that house and from the ranch without being
 seen. But though the place was bald and open to the four winds save for a
 few detached outbuildings, Annie-Many-Ponies went away upon the mesa and
 no one saw her go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not dare go to the corral for her horse. The corral was in plain
 sight of the house, and the eyes of Wagalexa Conka were keen as the eye of
 the Sioux, his foster brothers. He would see her there. He would call:
 "Annie, come here!" and she would go, and would stand submissive before
 him, and would be glad that he noticed her; for she was born of the tribe
 where women obey their masters, and the heritage of centuries may not be
 lightly lain aside like an outgrown garment. She felt that this was so;
 that although her heart might burn with resentment because he had
 forgotten and must be reminded by a strange white woman that the "squaw"
 was not present, still, if he called her she must go, because Wagalexa
 Conka was master there and the master must be obeyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down the dry wash where Applehead had hunted for baling wire she went
 swiftly, with the straight-backed, free stride of the plainswoman who
 knows not the muscle-bondage of boned girdle. In moccasins she walked; for
 a certain pride of race, a certain sense of the picture-value of beaded
 buckskin and bright cloth, held her fast to the gala dress of her people,
 modified and touched here and there with the gay ornaments of
 civilization. So much had her work in the silent drama taught her.
 Bareheaded, her hair in two glossy braids each tied with a big red bow,
 she strode on and on in the clear sunlight of spring.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not until she was more than two miles from the ranch did she show herself
 upon one of the numberless small ridges which, blended together in the
 distance, give that deceptive look of flatness to the mesa. Even two miles
 away, in that clear air that dwarfs distance so amazingly, Wagalexa Conka
 might recognize her if he looked at her with sufficient attention. But
 Wagalexa Conka, she told herself with a flash of her black eyes, would not
 look. Wagalexa Conka was too busy looking at that slim woman he had
 brought with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That ridge she crossed, and two others. On the last one she stopped and
 stood, straight and still, and stared away towards the mountains, shading
 her eyes with one spread palm. On a distant slope a small herd of cattle
 fed, scattered and at peace. Nearer, a great hawk circled slowly on
 widespread wings, his neck craned downward as if he were watching his own
 shadow move ghostlike over the grass. Annie-Many-Ponies, turning her eyes
 disappointedly from the empty mesa, envied the hawk his swift-winged
 freedom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When she looked again toward the far slopes next the mountains, a black
 speck rolled into view, the nucleus of a little dust cloud. Her face
 brightened a little; she turned abruptly and sought easy footing down that
 ridge, and climbed hurriedly the longer rise beyond. Once or twice, when
 she was on high ground, she glanced behind her uneasily, as does one whose
 mind holds a certain consciousness of wrongdoing. She did not pause, even
 then, but hurried on toward the dust cloud.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the rim of a shallow, saucer-like basin that lay cunningly concealed
 until one stood upon the very edge of it, Annie-Many-Ponies stopped again
 and stood looking out from under her spread palm. Presently the dust cloud
 moved over the crest of a ridge, and now that it was so much closer she
 saw clearly the horseman loping abreast of the dust. Annie-Many-Ponies
 stood for another moment watching, with that inscrutable half smile on her
 lips. She untied the cerise silk kerchief which she wore knotted loosely
 around her slim neck, waited until the horseman showed plainly in the
 distance and then, raising her right hand high above her head, waved the
 scarf three times in slow, sweeping half circles from right to left. She
 waited, her eyes fixed expectantly upon the horseman. Like a startled
 rabbit he darted to the left, pulled in his horse, turned and rode for
 three or four jumps sharply to the right; stopped short for ten seconds
 and then came straight on, spurring his horse to a swifter pace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies smiled and went down into the shallow basin and seated
 herself upon the wide, adobe curbing of an old well that marked, with the
 nearby ruins of an adobe house, the site, of an old habitation of tragic
 history. She waited with the absolute patience of her race for the
 horseman had yet a good two miles to cover. While she waited she smiled
 dreamily to herself and with dainty little pats and pulls she widened the
 flaring red bows on her hair and retied the cerise scarf in its
 picturesque, loose knot about her throat. As a final tribute to that
 feminine instinct which knows no race she drew from some cunningly devised
 hiding place a small, cheap "vanity box," and proceeded very gravely to
 powder her nose.

 CHAPTER III. TO THE VICTORS THE SPOILS
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Hey, boys!" Luck Lindsay shouted to Applehead and one or two of the Happy
 Family who were down at the chuck?wagon engaged in uneasy discussion
 as to what Luck would say when he found out about their intention to
 leave. "Come on up here?this is going to be a wiping out of old
 scores and I want to get it over with!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I calc'late the fur's about to fly," Applehead made dismal
 prophecy, as they started to obey the summons. "All 't su'prises me is 't
 he's held off this long. Two hours is a dang long time fer Luck to git in
 action, now I'm tellin' yuh!" He took off his hat and polished his shiny
 pate, as was his habit when perturbed. "I'm shore glad we had t' wait and
 set them wagon-tires," he added. "We'd bin started this mornin' only fer
 that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, we ain't done nothing," Happy Jack protested in premature self
 defense. "We ain't left the ranch yet. I guess a feller's got a right to
 THINK!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He has, if he's got anything to do it with," Pink could not forbear to
 remark pointedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if a feller didn't have, he'd have a fat chance borrying from YOU,"
 Happy Jack retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, by cripes, I ain't perpared to bet very high that there's a
 teacupful uh brains in this hull outfit," Big Medicine asserted. "We might
 a knowed Luck'd come back loaded fer bear; we WOULD a knowed it if we had
 any brains in our heads. I'm plumb sore at myself. By cripes, I need
 kickin'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll get it, chances are," Pink assured him grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck was in the living room, sitting at a table on which were scattered
 many papers Scribbled with figures. He had a cigarette in his lips, his
 hat on the back of his head and a twinkle in his eyes. He looked up and
 grinned as they came reluctantly into the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Time's money from now on, so this is going to be cut short as possible,"
 he began with his usual dynamic energy showing in his tone and in the
 movements of his hands as he gathered up the papers and evened their edges
 on the table top. "You fellows know how much you put into the game when we
 started out to come here and produce The Phantom Herd, don't you? If you
 don't, I've got the figures here. I guess the returns are all in on that
 picture?and so far She's brought us twenty-three thousand and four
 hundred dollars. She went big, believe me! I sold thirty states. Well,
 cost of production is-what we put in the pool, plus the cost of making the
 prints I got in Los. We pull out the profits according to what we put in?sabe?
 I guess that suits everybody, doesn't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure," one astonished voice gulped faintly. The others were dumb.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've figured it out that way?and to make sure I had it right
 I got Billy Wilders, a pal of mine that works in a bank there, to figure
 it himself and check up after me. We all put in our services?one
 man's work against every other man's work, mine same as any of you. Bill
 Holmes, here, didn't have any money up, and he was an apprentice?but
 I'm giving him twenty a week besides his board. That suit you, Bill?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess it's all right," Bill answered in his colorless tone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck, being extremely sensitive to tones, cocked an eye up at Bill before
 he deliberately peeled, from the roll he drew from his pocket, enough
 twenty dollar notes to equal the number of weeks Bill had worked for him.
 "And that's paying you darned good money for apprentice work," he informed
 him drily, a little hurt by Bill's lack of appreciation. For when you take
 a man from the streets because he is broke and hungry and homeless, and
 feed him and give him work and clothes and three meals a day and a warm
 bed to sleep in, if you are a normal human being you are going to expect a
 little gratitude from that man; Luck had a flash of disappointment when he
 saw how indifferently Bill Holmes took those twenties and counted them
 before shoving them into his pocket. His own voice was more crisply
 businesslike when he spoke again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie-Many-Ponies back yet? She's not in on the split either. I'm paying
 her ten a week besides her board. That's good money for a squaw." He
 counted out the amount in ten dollar bills and snapped a rubber band
 around them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now here is the profit, boys, on your winter's work. Applehead comes in
 with the use of his ranch and stock and wagons and so on. Here, pard?how
 does this look to you?" His own pleasure in what he was doing warmed from
 Luck's voice all the chill that Bill Holmes had sent into it. He smiled
 his contagious smile and peeled off fifty dollar banknotes until
 Applehead's eyes popped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, don't give me so dang much!" he gulped nervously when Luck had
 counted out for him the amount he had jotted down opposite his name. "That
 there's moren the hul dang ranch is worth if I was t' deed it over to yuh,
 Luck! I ain't goin' to take?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shut up," Luck commanded him affectionately. "That's yours?now,
 close your face and let me get this thing wound up. Now?WILL you
 quit your arguing, or shall I throw you out the window?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I calc'late you'd have a right busy time throwin' ME out the
 window," Applehead boasted, and backed into a corner to digest this
 astonishing turn of events.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One by one, as their names stood upon his list, Luck called the boys
 forward and with exaggerated deliberation peeled off fifty-dollar notes
 and one-hundred-dollar notes to take their breath and speech from them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With Billy Wilders, his friend in the bank, to help him, he had boyishly
 built that roll for just this heart-warming little ceremony. He might have
 written checks to square the account of each, but he wanted to make their
 eyes stand out, just as he was doing. He had looked forward to this half
 hour more eagerly than any of them guessed; he had, with his eyes closed,
 visualized this scene over more than one cigarette, his memory picturing
 vividly another scene wherein these same young men had cheerfully emptied
 their pockets and planned many small personal sacrifices that he, Luck
 Lindsay, might have money enough to come here to New Mexico and make his
 one Big Picture. Luck felt that nothing less than a display of the profits
 in real money could ever quite balance that other scene when all the Happy
 Family had in the world went in the pot and they mourned because it was so
 little.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, I betche Luck robbed a bank er something!" Happy Jack stuttered with
 an awkward attempt to conceal his delight when his name was called, his
 investment was read and the little sheaf of currency that represented his
 profit was laid in his outstretched palm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's me for the movies if this is the way they pan out," Weary declared
 gleefully. "Mamma! I didn't know there was so much money in the world!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll bet he milked Los Angeles dry of paper money," Andy Green asserted
 facetiously, thumbing his small fortune gloatingly. "Holding out anything
 for yourself, Luck? We don't want to be hogs."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm taking care of my interests?don't you worry about that a
 minute," Luck stated complacently. "I held mine out first. That wipes the
 slate?and cleans up the bank-roll. I maintain The Phantom Herd was
 so-o-ome picture, boys. They'll be getting it here in 'Querque soon?we'll
 all go in and see it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now we're all set for a fresh start. And while you're all here I'll just
 put you up to date on what kind of a deal I made with Dewitt. We come in
 under the wing of Excelsior, and our brand name will be Flying U Feature
 Film?how does that hit you? You boys are all on a straight
 board-and-salary basis?thirty dollars a week, and it's up to me to
 make you earn it!" He grinned and beckoned to Jean Douglas Avery and her
 companions in the next room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Avery, here, is our leading woman?keeping the name of Jean
 Douglas, since she made it valuable in that Lazy A serial she did a year
 or so ago. Lite is on the same footing as the rest of you boys. Her father
 will be my assistant in choosing locations and so on. Tommy Johnson, as I
 said, is another assistant in another capacity, that of scenic artist and
 stage carpenter. Pete Lowry, here, is camera man and Bill Holmes will be
 his assistant. The rest of you work wherever I need you?a good deal
 the way we did last winter. Annie-Many-Ponies stays with us as character
 lead and is in general stock. Rosemary?" he stopped and smiled at
 her understandingly?"Rosemary draws fifteen a week?oh, don't
 get scared! I won't give you any foreground stuff! just atmosphere when I
 need it, and general comforter and mascot of the company!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck may have stretched a point there, but if he did it was merely a
 technical one. Rosemary Green was hopelessly camera-shy, but he could use
 her in background atmosphere, and when it came to looking after the
 physical and mental welfare of the bunch she was worth her weight in any
 precious metal you may choose to name.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You better put me down as camp cook and dishwasher, Luck Lindsay,"
 Rosemary protested, blushing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?thank the Lord you won't have to cook for this hungry bunch any
 longer. I've got a Mexican hired and headed this way. There'll be no more
 of that kind of thing for you, lady?not while you're with us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, boys, let's get organized for action. Weather's perfect?Lowry's
 been raving over the light, all the way out from town. I've got a range
 picture all blocked out?did it while I was waiting in Los for Jean
 to show up. Done anything about roundup yet, Applehead?"?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Poor old Applehead, with his guilty conscience and his soft-hearted
 affection for Luck so deeply stirred by the money laid in his big-knuckled
 hand, shuffled his feet and cleared his throat and did not get one
 intelligible word past his dry tongue.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you haven't," Luck hurried on, spurred by his inpatient energy, "I
 want to organize and get out right away with a regular roundup
 outfitchuck-wagon, remuda and all?see what I mean I While I'm
 getting the picture of the stuff I want, we can gather and brand your
 calves. That way, all my range scenes will be of the real thing. I may
 want to throw the Chavez outfit in with ours, too, so as to get bigger
 stuff. I'll try and locate Ramon Chavez and see what I can do. But anyway,
 I want the roundup outfit ready to start just as soon as possible?tomorrow,
 if we could get it together in time. How about that cracked tongue on the
 chuck-wagon? Anybody fixed that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, I wired it up so'st it's as solid as the rest uh the runnin'
 gear," Applehead confessed shamefacedly, rolling his eyes apprehensively
 at the flushed faces of his fellow traitors.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yuh did? Good! Tires need setting, if I recollect?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Er?I had the boys set the tires, 'n'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine! I might have known you fellows would put things in shape while I
 was gone! How about the horses? I thought I saw a bunch in the big corral?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I rustled enough saddle horses to give us all two apiece," Applehead
 admitted, perspiring coldly. "'Tain't much of a string, but?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did? Sounds like you've been reading my mind, Applehead. Now we'll
 grubstake the outfit?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Er?well, I took the chuck-wagon in yest'day and loaded 'er up with
 grub fer two weeks," blurted Applehead heroically. "I was figurin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! Couldn't ask better. Applehead, you sure are there when it comes to
 backing a man's play. If I haven't said much about how I stand toward you
 fellows it isn't because I don't appreciate every durned one of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Happy Family squirmed guiltily and made way for Applehead, who was
 sidling toward the open door, his face showing alarming symptoms of
 apoplexy. Their confusion Luck set down to a becoming modesty. He went on
 planning and perfecting details. Standing as he did on the threshold of a
 career to which his one big success had opened the door, he was wholly
 absorbed in making good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was nothing now to balk his progress, he told himself. He had his
 company, he had the location for his big range stuff, he had all the
 financial backing any reasonable man could want. He had a salary that in
 itself gauged the prestige he had gained among producers, and as an added
 incentive to do the biggest work of his life he had a contract giving him
 a royalty on all prints of his pictures in excess of a fixed number.
 Better than all this, he had big ideals and an enthusiasm for the work
 that knew no limitations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Perhaps he was inclined to dream too big; per-haps he assumed too great an
 enthusiasm on the part of those who worked with him?I don't know
 just where he did place the boundary line. I do know that he never once
 suspected the Happy Family of any meditated truancy from the ranch and his
 parting instructions to "sit tight." I also know that the Happy Family was
 not at all likely to volunteer information of their lapse. And as for
 Applehead, the money burned his soul deep with remorse; so deep that he
 went around with an abject eagerness to serve Luck that touched that young
 man as a rare example of a bone-deep loyalty that knows no deceit. Which
 proves once more how fortunate it is that we cannot always see too deeply
 into the thoughts and motives of our friends.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV. LOVE WORDS FOR ANNIE
 </h2>
 <p>
 In Tijeras Arroyo the moon made black shadows where stood the tiny knolls
 here and there, marking frequently the windings of dry washes where bushes
 grew in ragged patches and where tall weeds of mid-May tangled in the
 wind. The roundup tents of the Flying U Feature Film Company stood white
 as new snow in the moonlight, though daylight showed them an odd,
 light-blue tint for photographic purposes. On a farther slope cunningly
 placed by the scenic artist to catch the full sunlight of midday, the camp
 of the Chavez brothers gleamed softly in the magic light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So far had spring roundup progressed that Luck was holding the camp in
 Tijeras Arroyo for picture-making only. Applehead's calves were branded,
 to the youngest pair of knock-kneed twins which Happy Jack found curled up
 together cunningly hidden in a thicket. They had been honored with a
 "close-up" scene, those two spotted calves, and were destined to further
 honors which they did not suspect and could not appreciate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They slept now, as slept the two camps upon the two slopes that lay
 moon-bathed at midnight. Back where the moon was making the barren
 mountains a wonderland of deep purple and black and silvery gray and
 brown, a coyote yapped a falsetto message and was answered by one nearer
 at hand?his mate, it might be. In a bush under the bank that made of
 it a black blot in the unearthly whiteness of the sand, a little bird
 fluttered uneasily and sent a small, inquiring chirp into the stillness.
 From somewhere farther up the arroyo drifted a faint, aromatic odor of
 cigarette smoke.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Had you been there by the bush you could not have told when
 Annie-Many-Ponies passed by; you would not have seen her?certainly
 you could not have heard the soft tread of her slim, moccasined feet. Yet
 she passed the bush and the bank and went away up the arroyo, silent as
 the shadows themselves, swift as the coyote that trotted over a nearby
 ridge to meet her mate nearer the mountains. Sol following much the same
 instinct in much the same way, Annie-Many-Ponies stole out to meet the man
 her heart timidly yearned for a possible mate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She reached the rock-ledge where the smoke odor was strongest, and she
 stopped. She saw Ramon Chavez, younger of the Chavez brothers who were
 ten-mile-off neighbors of Applehead, and who owned many cattle and much
 land by right of an old Spanish grant. He was standing in the shadow of
 the ledge, leaning against it as they of sun-saturated New Mexico always
 lean against anything perpendicular and solid near which they happen to
 stand. He was watching the white-lighted arroyo while he smoked, waiting
 for her, unconscious of her near presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies stood almost within reach of him, but she did not make
 her presence known. With the infinite wariness of her race she waited to
 see what he would do; to read, if she might, what were his thoughts?his
 attitude toward her in his unguarded moments. That little, inscrutable
 smile which so exasperated Applehead was on her lips while she watched
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon finished that cigarette, threw away the stab and rolled and lighted
 another. Still Annie-Many-Ponies gave no little sign of her presence. He
 watched the arroyo, and once he leaned to one side and stared back at his
 own quiet camp on the slope that had the biggest and the wildest mountain
 of that locality for its background. He settled himself anew with his
 other shoulder against the rock, and muttered something in Spanish?that
 strange, musical talk which Annie-Many-Ponies could not understand. And
 still she watched him, and exulted in his impatience for her coming, and
 wondered if it would always be lovelight which she would see in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was not of her race, though in her pride she thought him favored when
 she named him akin to the Sioux. He was not of her race, but he was tall
 and he was straight, he was dark as she, he was strong and brave and he
 bad many cattle and much broad acreage. Annie-Many-Ponies smiled upon him
 in the dark and was glad that she, the daughter of a chief of the Sioux,
 had been found good in his sight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Five minutes, ten minutes. The coyote, yap-yap-yapping in the broken land
 beyond them, found his mate and was silent. Ramon Chavez, waiting in the
 shadow of the ledge, muttered a Mexican oath and stepped out into the
 moonlight and stood there, tempted to return to his camp?for he,
 also, had pride that would not bear much bruising.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies waited. When he muttered again and threw his cigarette
 from him as though it had been something venomous; when he turned his face
 toward his own tents and took a step forward, she laughed softly, a mere
 whisper of amusement that might have been a sleepy breeze stirring the
 bushes somewhere near. Ramon started and turned his face her way; in the
 moonlight his eyes shone with a certain love-hunger which
 Annie-Many-Ponies exulted to see?because she did not understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You not let moon look on you," she chided in an undertone, her sentences
 clipped of superfluous words as is the Indian way, her voice that pure,
 throaty melody that is a gift which nature gives lavishly to the women of
 savage people. "Moon see, men see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon swung back into the shadow, reached out his two arms to fold her
 close and got nothing more substantial than another whispery laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where are yoh,sweetheart?" He peered into the shadow where she had been,
 and saw the place empty. He laughed, chagrined by her elusiveness, yet
 hungering for her the more.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You not touch," she warned. "Till priest say marriage prayers, no man
 touch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He called her a devil in Spanish, and she thought it a love-word and
 laughed and came nearer. He did not attempt to touch her, and so,
 reassured, she stood close so that he could see the pure, Indian profile
 of her face when she raised it to the sky in a mute invocation, it might
 be, of her gods.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When yoh come?" he asked swiftly, his race betrayed in tone and accent.
 "I look and look?I no see yoh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I come," she stated with a quiet meaning. "I not like cow, for make
 plenty noise. I stand here, you smoke two times, I look."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mus' be moonbeam," he told her, reaching out again, only to lay hold
 upon nothing. "Come back, sweetheart. I be good."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not like you touch," she repeated. "I good girl. I mind priest, I read
 prayers, I mind Wagalexa Conka?" There she faltered, for the last
 boast was no longer the truth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon was quick to seize upon the one weak point of her armor. "So? He
 send yoh then to talk with Ramon at midnight? Yoh come to please yoh
 boss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies turned her troubled face his way. "Wagalexa Conka sleep
 plenty. I not ask," she confessed. "You tell me come here you tell me must
 talk when no one hear. I come. I no ask Wagalexa Conka?him say good
 girl stay by camp. Him say not walk in night-time, say me not talk you. I
 no ask; I just come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yoh lov' him, perhaps? More as yoh lov' me? Always I see yoh look at him?always
 watch, watch. Always I see yoh jomp when he snap the finger; always yoh
 run like train dog. Yoh lov' him, perhaps? Bah! Yoh dirt onder his feet."
 Ramon did not seriously consider that any woman whom he favored could
 sanely love another man more than himself, but to his nature jealousy was
 a necessary adjunct of lovemaking; not to have displayed jealousy would
 have been to betray indifference, as he interpreted the tender passion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, woman-wily though she was by nature, had little
 learning in the devious ways of lovemaking. Eyes might speak, smiles might
 half reveal, half hide her thoughts; but the tongue, as her tribe had
 taught her sternly, must speak the truth or keep silent. Now she bent her
 head, puzzling how best to put her feelings toward Luck Lindsay into
 honest words which Ramon would understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yoh lov' him, perhaps?since yoh all time afraid he be mad." Ramon
 persisted, beating against the wall of her Indian taciturnity which always
 acted as a spur upon his impetuosity. Besides, it was important to him
 that he should know just what was the tie between these two. He had heard
 Luck Lindsay speak to the girl in the Sioux tongue. He had seen her eyes
 lighten as she made swift answer. He had seen her always eager to do
 Luck's bidding?had seen her anticipate his wants and minister to
 them as though it was her duty and her pleasure to do so. It was vital
 that he should know, and it was certain that he could not question Luck
 upon the subject?for Ramon Chavez was no fool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Long time ago?when I was papoose with no shoes," she began with
 seeming irrelevance, her eyes turning instinctively toward the white tents
 of the Flying U camp gleaming in the distance, "my people go for work in
 Buffalo Bill show. My father go, my mother go, I go. All time we dance for
 show, make Indian fight with cowboys?all them act for Buffalo
 Bill-Pawnee Bill show. That time Wagalexa Conka boss of Indians. He Indian
 Agent. He take care whole bunch. He make peace when fights, he give
 med'cine when somebody sick. He awful good to them Indians. He give me
 candy, always stop to talk me. I like him. My father like him. All them
 Indians like him plenty much. My father awful sick one time, he no let
 doctor come. Leg broke all in pieces. He say die plenty if Wagalexa Conka
 no make well. I go ticket wagon, tell Wagalexa Conka, he come quick, fix
 up leg all right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All them Indians like to make him?" She stopped, searching her mind
 for the elusive, little-used word which she had learned in the mission
 school. "Make him sdop'," she finished triumphantly. "Indians make much
 dance, plenty music, lots speeches make him Indian man. My father big
 chief, he make Wagalexa Conka him son. Make him my brother. Give him
 Indian name Wagalexa Conka. All Indians call that name for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pretty soon show stop, all them Indians go home by reservation. long time
 we don't see Wagalexa Conka no more. I get big girl, go school little bit.
 Pretty soon Wagalexa Conka come back, for wants them Indians for work in
 pictures. My father go, my mother go, all us go. We work long time. I,"
 she added with naive pride in her comeliness, "awful good looking. I do
 lots of foreground stuff. Pretty soon hard times come. Indians go home by
 reservation. I go?I don't like them reservations no more. Too
 lonesome. I like for work all time in pictures. I come, tell Wagalexa
 Conka I be Indian girl for pictures. He write letter for agent, write
 letter for my father. They writes letter for say yes, I stay. I stay and
 do plenty more foreground stuff."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see you do moch foreground work since that white girl come,"
 Ramon observed, hitting what he instinctively knew was a tender point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Had he seen her face, he must have been satisfied that the chance shot
 struck home. But in the shadow hate blazed unseen from her eyes. She did
 not speak, and so he went back to his first charge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All this don't tell me moch," he complained. "Yoh lov' him, maybe? That's
 what I ask."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wagalexa Conka my brother, my father, my friend," she replied calmly, and
 let him interpret it as he would.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He treats yoh like a dog. He crazee 'bout that Jean. He gives her all
 smiles, all what yoh call foreground stuff. I know?I got eyes. Me,
 it makes me mad for see how he treat yoh?and yoh so trying hard
 always to Please. He got no heart for yoh?me, I see that." He moved
 a step closer, hesitating, wanting yet not quite daring to touch her. "Me,
 I lov' yoh, little Annie," he murmured. "Yoh lov' me little bit, eh? Jus'
 little bit! Jus' for say, 'Ramon, I go weeth yoh, I be yoh woman?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies widened the distance between them. "Why you not say
 wife?" she queried suspiciously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Woman, wife, sweetheart?all same," he assured her with his voice
 like a caress. "All words mean I lov' yoh jus' same. Now yoh say yoh lov'
 me, say yoh go weeth me, I be one happy man. I go back on camp and my
 heart she's singing lov' song. My girl weeth eyes that shine so bright,
 she lov' me moch as I lov' her. That what my heart she sing. Yoh not be so
 cruel like stone?yoh say, 'Ramon, I lov' yoh.' Jus' like that! So
 easy to say!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not easy," she denied, moved to save her freedom yet a while longer. "I
 say them words, then I?then I not be same girl like now. Maybe much
 troubles come. Maybe much happy?I dunno. Lots time I see plenty
 trouble come for girl that say them words for man. Some time plenty happy?I
 think trouble comes most many times. I think Wagalexa Conka he be awful
 mad. I not like for hims be mad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you make ME mad?Ramon what loves yoh! Yoh like for Ramon be
 mad, perhaps? Always yoh 'fraid Luck Lindsay this, 'fraid Luck that other.
 Me, I gets damn' sick hear that talk all time. Bimeby he marree som' girl,
 then what for you? He don' maree yoh, eh? He don' lov' yoh; he think too
 good for maree Indian girl. Me, I not think like that. I, Ramon Chavez, I
 think proud to lov, yoh. Ramon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not think Wagalexa Conka marry me." The girl was turning stubborn under
 his importunities. "Wagalexa Conka my brother?my friend. I tell you
 plenty time. Now I tell no more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ramon loves yoh so moch," he pleaded, and smiled to himself when he saw
 her turn toward toward him again. The love-talk?that was what a
 woman likes best to hear! "Yoh say yoh lov' Ramon jus' little bit!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not say now. When I say I be sure I say truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, then I be sad till yoh lov' me. Yoh maybe be happy, yoh know
 Ramon's got heavy heart for yoh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I plenty sorry, you be sad for me," she confessed demurely. "I lov' yoh
 so moch! I think nothing but how beautiful my sweetheart is. I not tease
 yoh no more. Tell me, how long Luck says he stay out here? Maybe yoh hear
 sometimes he's going for taking pictures in town?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not hear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Going home, maybe? You mus' hear little bit. Yoh tell me, sweetheart;
 what's he gone do when roundup's all finish? Me, I know she's finish las'
 week. Looks like he's taking pictures out here all summer! You hear him
 say something, maybe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not hear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Them vaqueros?bah! They don't bear nothings either. What's matter
 over there, nobody hear nothing? Luck, he got no tongue when camera's shut
 up, perhaps?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nah?I dunno."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon looked at her for a minute in mute rage. It was not the first time
 he had found himself hard against the immutable reticence of the Indian in
 her nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why you snapping teeth like a wolf?" she asked him slyly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me? I don' snap my teeth, sweetheart." It cost Ramon some effort to keep
 his voice softened to the love key.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why you not ask Wagalexa Conka what he do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don' care, that's why I don' ask. Me, it's' no matter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He hesitated a moment, evidently weighing a matter of more importance to
 him than he would have Annie-Many-Ponies suspect. "Sweetheart, yoh do one
 thing for Ramon?" His voice might almost be called wheedling. "Me, I'm
 awful busy tomorrow. I got long ride away off?to my rancho. I got to
 see my brother Tomas. I be back here not before night. Yoh tell Bill
 Holmes he come here by this rock?yoh say midnight that's good time?I
 sure be here that time. Yoh say I got something I wan' tell him. Yoh do
 that for Ramon, sweetheart?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He waited, trying to hide the fact that he was anxious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not like Bill Holmes." Annie-Many-Ponies spoke with an air of finality.
 "Bill Holmes comes close, I feel snakes. Him not friend to Wagalexa Conka?say
 nothing?always go around still, like fox watching for rabbit. You
 not friend to Bill Holmes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me? No?I not friend, querida mia. I got business. I sell Bill
 Holmes one silver bridle, perhaps. I don' know?mus' talk about it.
 Yoh tell him come here by big rock, sweetheart?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies took a minute for deliberation?which is the Indian
 way. Ramon, having learned patience, said no more but watched her
 slant-eyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell," she promised at last, and added, "I go now." Then she slipped
 away. And Ramon, though he stood for several minutes by the rock smiling
 queerly and staring down the arroyo, caught not the slightest glimpse of
 her after she left him. He knew that she would deliver faithfully his
 message to Bill Holmes, she had given her word. That was one great
 advantage, considered Ramon, in dealing with those direct, uncompromising
 natures. She might torment him with her aloofness and her reticence, but
 once he had won her to a full confidence and submission he need not
 trouble himself further about her loyalty. She would tell Bill Holmes?and,
 what was vastly more important, she would do it secretly; he had not dared
 to speak of that, but he thought he might safely trust to her natural
 wariness. So Ramon, after a little, stole away to his own camp quite
 satisfied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next night, when he stood in the shadow of the rock ledge and waited,
 he was not startled by the unexpected presence of the person he wanted to
 see. For although Bill Holmes came as cautiously as he knew how, and
 avoided the wide, bright-lighted stretches of arroyo where he would have
 been plainly visible, Ramon both saw and heard him before he reached the
 ledge. What Ramon did not see or hear was Annie-Many-Ponies, who did not
 quite believe that those two wished merely to talk about a silver bridle,
 and who meant to listen and find out why it was that they could not talk
 openly before all the boys.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies had ways of her own. She did not tell Ramon that she
 doubted his word, nor did she refuse to deliver the message. She waited
 calmly until Bill Holmes left camp stealthily that night, and she followed
 him. It was perfectly simple and sensible and the right thing to do; if
 you wanted to know for sure whether a person lied to you, you had but to
 watch and listen and let your own eyes and ears prove guilt or innocence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Annie-Many-Ponies stood by the rock and listened and watched. She did
 not see any silver bridle. She heard many words, but the two were speaking
 in that strange Spanish talk which she did not know at all, save "Querida
 mia," which Ramon had told her meant sweetheart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two talked, low-voiced and earnest, Bill was telling all that he knew
 of Luck Lindsay's plans?and that was not much.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He don't talk," Bill complained. "He just tells the bunch a day ahead?just
 far enough to get their makeup and costumes on, generally. But he won't
 stay around here much longer; he's taken enough spring roundup stuff now
 for half a dozen pictures. He'll be moving in to the ranch again pretty
 quick. And I know this picture calls for a lot of town business that he'll
 have to take. I saw the script the other day." This, of course, being a
 free translation of the meaningless jumble of strange words which Annie
 heard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What town business is that? Where will he work?" Ramon was plainly
 impatient of so much vagueness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, there's a bank robbery?I paid particular attention, Ramon, so
 I know for certain. But when he'll do it, or what bank he'll use, I don't
 know any more than you do. And there's a running fight down the street and
 through the Mexican quarter. The rest is just street stuff?that and
 a fiesta that I think he'll probably me the old plaza for location. He'll
 need a lot of Mexicans for that stuff. He'll want you, of course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That bank?who will do that?" Ramon's fingers trembled so that he
 could scarcely roll a cigarette. "Andy, perhaps?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?that's the Mexican bunch. I?why, I guess that will maybe
 be you, Ramon. I wasn't paying much attention to the parts?I was
 after locations, and I only had about two minutes at the script. But he's
 been giving you some good bits right along where he needed a Mexican type;
 and those scenes in the rocks the other day was bandit stuff with you for
 lead. It'll be you or Miguel?the Native Son, as they call him?and
 so far he's cast for another part. That's the worst of Luck. He won't talk
 about what he's going to do till he's all ready to do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a little further discussion. Ramon muttered a few sentences?rapid
 instructions, Annie-Many-Ponies believed from the tone he used.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, I'll keep you posted," Bill Holmes replied in English. And he
 added as he started off, "You can send word by the squaw."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went carefully back down the arroyo, keeping as much as possible in the
 shade. Behind him stole Annie-Many-Ponies, noiseless as the shadow of a
 cloud. Bill Holmes, she reflected angrily, had seen the day, not so far in
 the past, when he was happy if the "squaw" but smiled upon him. It was
 because she had repelled his sly lovemaking that he had come to speak of
 her slightingly like that; she knew it. She could have named the very day
 when his manner toward her had changed. Mingled with her hate and dread of
 him was a new contempt and a new little anxiety over this clandestine
 intimacy between Ramon and him. Why should Bill Holmes keep Ramon posted?
 Surely not about a silver bridle!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shunka Chistala was whining in her little tent when she came into the
 camp. She heard Bill Holmes stumble over the end of the chuck-wagon tongue
 and mutter the customary profanity with which the average man meets an
 incident of that kind. She whispered a fierce command to the little black
 dog and stood very still for a minute, listening. She did not hear
 anything further, either from Bill Holmes or the dog, and finally
 reassured by the silence, she crept into her tent and tied the flaps
 together on the inside, and lay down in her blankets with the little black
 dog contentedly curled at her feet with his nose between his front paws.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V. FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMPANY
 </h2>
 <p>
 All through breakfast Applehead seemed to have something weighty on his
 mind. He kept pulling at his streaked, reddish-gray mustache when his
 fingers should have been wholly occupied with his food, and he stared
 abstractedly at the ground after he had finished his first cup of coffee
 and before he took his second. Once Bill Holmes caught him glaring with an
 intensity which circumstances in no wise justified?and it was Bill
 Holmes who first shifted his gaze in vague uneasiness when he tried to
 stare Applehead down. Annie-Many-Ponies did not glance at him at all, so
 far as one could discover; yet she was the first to sense trouble in the
 air, and withdrew herself from the company and sat apart, wrapped closely
 in her crimson shawl that matched well the crimson bows on her two shiny
 braids.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck, keenly alive to the moods of his people, looked at her inquiringly.
 "Come on up by the fire, Annie," he commanded gently. "What you sitting
 away off there for? Come and eat?I want you to work today."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not reply, but she rose obediently and came forward
 in the silent way she had, stepping lightly, straight and slim and darkly
 beautiful. Applehead glanced at her sourly, and her lashes drooped to hide
 the venom in her eyes as she passed him to stand before Luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I not hungry," she told Luck tranquilly, yet with a hardness in her voice
 which did not escape him, who knew her so well. "I go put on makeup."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wear that striped blanket you used last Saturday when we worked up there
 in Tijeras Canon. Same young squaw makeup you wore then, Annie." He eyed
 her sharply as she turned away to her own tent, and he observed that when
 she passed Applehead she took two steps to one side, widening the distance
 between them. He watched her until she lifted her tent flap, stooped and
 disappeared within. Then he looked at Applehead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's wrong between you two?" he asked the old man quizzically. "Her dog
 been licking your cat again, or what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're danged right he ain't!" Applehead testified boastfully.
 "Compadre's got that there dawg's goat, now I'm tellin' yuh! He don't take
 nothin' off him ner her neither."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What you been doing to her, then?" Luck set his empty plate on the ground
 beside him and began feeling for the makings of a cigarette. "Way she
 side-stepped you, I know there must be SOMETHING."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I ain't done a danged thing to that there squaw! She ain't got
 any call to go around givin' me the bad eye." He looked at the
 breakfasting company and then again at Luck, and gave an almost
 imperceptible backward jerk of his head as he got awkwardly to his feet
 and strolled away toward the milling horses in the remuda.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So when Luck had lighted his fresh-rolled cigarette he followed Applehead
 unobtrusively. "Well, what's on your mind?" he wanted to know when he came
 up with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I don't want you to think I'm buttin' in on your affairs,
 Luck," Applehead began after a minute, "but seein' as you ast me what's
 wrong, I'm goin' to tell yuh straight out. We got a couple of danged fine
 women in this here bunch, and I shore do hate to see things goin' on
 around here that'd shame 'em if they was to find it out. And fur's I can
 see they will find it out, sooner or later. Murder ain't the only kinda
 wickedness that's hard to cover up. I know you feel about as I do on some
 subjects; you never did like dirt around you, no better'n?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get to the point, man. What's wrong?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Applehead, turning a darker shade of red than was his usual hue,
 cleared his throat and blurted out what he had to say. He had heard Shunka
 Chistala whinnying at midnight in the tent of Annie-Many-Ponies, and had
 gone outside to see what was the matter. He didn't know, he explained, but
 what his cat Compadre was somehow involved. He had stood in the shadow of
 his tent for a few minutes, and had seen Bill Holmes sneak into camp,
 coming from up the arroyo somewhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For some reason he waited a little longer, and he had seen a woman's
 shadow move stealthily up to the front of Annie's tent, and had seen Annie
 slip inside and had heard her whisper a command of some sort to the dog,
 which had immediately hushed its whining. He hated to be telling tales on
 anybody, but he knew how keenly Luck felt his responsibility toward the
 Indian girl, and he thought he ought to know. This night-prowling, he
 declared, had shore got to be stopped, or he'd be danged if he didn't run
 'em both outa camp himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bill Holmes might have been out of camp," Luck said calmly, "but you sure
 must be mistaken about Annie. She's straight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You think she is," Applehead corrected him. "But you don't know a danged
 thing about it. A girl that's behavin' herself don't go chasin' all over
 the mesa alone, the way she's been doin' all spring. I never said nothin'
 'cause it wa'n't none of my put-in. But that Injun had a heap of business
 off away from the ranch whilst you was in Los Angeles, Luck. Sneaked off
 every day, just about?and 'd be gone fer hours at a time. You kin
 ast any of the boys, if yuh don't want to take my word. Or you kin ast
 Mis' Green; she kin tell ye, if she's a mind to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did Bill Holmes go with her?" Luck's eyes were growing hard and gray.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As to that I won't say, fer I don't know and I'm tellin' yuh what I seen
 myself. Bill Holmes done a lot uh walkin' in to town, fur as that goes;
 and he didn't always git back the same day neither. He never went off with
 Annie, and he never came back with her, fur as I ever seen. But," he added
 grimly, "they didn't come back together las' night, neither. They come
 about three or four minutes apart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck thought a minute, scowling off across the arroyo. Not even to
 Applehead, bound to him by closer ties than anyone there, did he ever
 reveal his thoughts completely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?I'll attend to them," he said finally. "Don't say
 anything to the bunch; these things aren't helped by talk. Get into your
 old cowman costume and use that big gray you rode in that drive we made
 the other day. I'm going to pick up the action where we left off when it
 turned cloudy. Tomorrow or next day I want to move the outfit back to the
 ranch. There's quite a lot of town stuff I want to get for this picture."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead looked at him uncertainly, tempted to impress further upon him
 the importance of safeguarding the morals of his company. But he knew Luck
 pretty well?having lived with him for months at a time when Luck was
 younger and even more peppery than now. So he wisely condensed his reply
 to a nod, and went back to the breakfast fire polishing his bald bead with
 the flat of his palm. He met Annie-Many-Ponies coming to ask Luck which of
 the two pairs of beaded moccasins she carried in her hands he would like
 to have her wear. She did not look at Applehead at all as she passed, but
 he nevertheless became keenly aware of her animosity and turned half
 around to glare after her resentfully. You'd think, he told himself
 aggrievedly, that he was the one that had been acting up! Let her go to
 Luck?she'd danged soon be made to know her place in camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies went confidently on her way, carrying the two pairs of
 beaded moccasins in her hands. Her face was more inscrutable than ever.
 She was pondering deeply the problem of Bill Holmes' business with Ramon,
 and she was half tempted to tell Wagalexa Conka of that secret intimacy
 which must carry on its converse under cover of night. She did not trust
 Bill Holmes. Why must he keep Ramon posted? She glanced ahead to where
 Luck stood thinking deeply about something, and her eyes softened in a shy
 sympathy with his trouble. Wagalexa Conka worked hard and thought much and
 worried more than was good for him. Bill Holmes, she decided fiercely,
 should not add to those worries. She would warn Ramon when next she talked
 with him. She would tell Ramon that he must not be friends with Bill
 Holmes; in the meantime, she would watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ten feet from Luck she stopped short, sensing trouble in the hardness that
 was in his eyes. She stood there and waited in meek subjection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie, come here!" Luck's voice was no less stern because it was lowered
 so that a couple of the boys fussing with the horses inside the rope
 corral could not overhear what he had to say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, pulling one of the shiny black braids into the correct
 position over her shoulder and breast, stepped soft-footedly up to him and
 stopped. She did not ask him what he wanted. She waited until it was his
 pleasure to speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie, I want you to keep away from Bill Holmes." Luck was not one to
 mince his words when he had occasion to speak of disagreeable things. "It
 isn't right for you to let him make love to you on the sly. You know that.
 You know you must not leave camp with him after dark. You make me ashamed
 of you when you do those things. You keep away from Bill Holmes and stay
 in camp nights. If you're a bad girl, I'll have to send you back to the
 reservation?and I'll have to tell the agent and Chief Big Turkey why
 I send you back. I can't have anybody in my company who doesn't act right.
 Now remember?don't make me speak to you again about it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies stood there, and the veiled, look was in her eyes. Her
 face was a smooth, brown mask?beautiful to look upon but as
 expressionless as the dead. She did not protest her innocence, she did not
 explain that she hated and distrusted Bill Holmes and that she had, months
 ago, repelled his surreptitious advances. Luck would have believed, for he
 had known Annie-Many-Ponies since she was a barefooted papoose, and he had
 never known her to tell him an untruth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You go now and get ready for work. Wear the moccasins with the birds on
 the toes." He pointed to them and turned away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies also turned and went her way and said nothing. What,
 indeed, could she say? She did not doubt that Luck had seen her the night
 before, and had seen also Bill Holmes when he left camp or returned?perhaps
 both. She could not tell him that Bill Holmes had gone out to meet Ramon,
 for that, she felt instinctively, was a secret which Ramon trusted her not
 to betray. She could not tell Wagalexa Conka, either, that she met Ramon
 often when the camp was asleep. He would think that as bad as meeting Bill
 Holmes. She knew that he did not like Ramon, but merely used him and his
 men and horses and cattle for a price, to better his pictures. Save in a
 purely business way she had never seen him talking with Ramon. Never as he
 talked with the boys of the Flying U?his Happy Family, he called
 them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She said nothing. She dressed for the part she was to play. She twined
 flowers in her hair and smoothed out the red bows and laid them carefully
 away?since Wagalexa Conka did not wish her to wear ribbon bows in
 this picture. She murmured caresses to Shunka Chistala, the little black
 dog that was always at her heels. She rode with the company to the rocky
 gorge which was "location" for today. When Wagalexa Conka called to her
 she went and climbed upon a high rock and stood just where he told her to
 stand, and looked just as he told her to look, and stole away through the
 rocks and out of the scene exactly as he wished her to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But when Wagalexa Conka?sorry for the harshness he had felt it his
 duty to show that morning?smiled and told her she had done fine, and
 that he was pleased with her, Annie-Many-Ponies did not smile back with
 that slow, sweet, heart-twisting smile which was at once her sharpest
 weapon and her most endearing trait.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bill Holmes who had also had his sharp word of warning, and had been told
 very plainly to cut out this flirting with Annie if he wanted to remain on
 Luck's payroll, eyed her strangely. Once he tried to have a secret word
 with her, but she moved away and would not look at him. For
 Annie-Many-Ponies, hurt and bitter as she felt toward her beloved Wagalexa
 Conka, hated Bill Holmes fourfold for being the cause of her humiliation.
 That she did not also hate Ramon Chavez as being equally guilty with Bill
 Holmes, went far toward proving how strong a hold he had gained upon her
 heart.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI. "I GO WHERE WAGALEXA CONKA SAY"
 </h2>
 <p>
 That afternoon Ramon joined them, suave as ever and seeming very much at
 peace with the world and his fellow-beings. He watched the new leading
 woman make a perilous ride down a steep, rocky point and dash up to camera
 and on past it where she set her horse back upon, its haunches with a fine
 disregard for her bones and a still finer instinct for putting just the
 right dash of the spectacular into her work without overdoing it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That senora, she's all right, you bet!" he praised the feat to those who
 stood near him; "me, I not be stuck on ron my caballo down that place. You
 bet she's fine rider. My sombrero, he's come off to that lady!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jean, hearing, glanced at him with that little quirk of the lips which was
 the beginning of a smile, and rode off to join her father and Lite Avery.
 "He made that sound terribly sincere, didn't he?" she commented. "It takes
 a Mexican to lift flattery up among the fine arts." Then she thought no
 more about it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies was sitting apart, on a rock where her gay blanket made
 a picturesque splotch of color against the gray barrenness of the hill
 behind her. She, too, heard what Ramon said, and she, too, thought that he
 had made the praise sound terribly sincere. He had not spoken to her at
 all after the first careless nod of recognition when he rode up. And
 although her reason had approved of his caution, her sore heart ached for
 a little kindness from him. She turned her eyes toward him now with a
 certain wistfulness; but though Ramon chanced to be looking toward her she
 got no answering light in his eyes, no careful little signal that his
 heart was yearning for her. He seemed remote, as indifferent to her as
 were any of the others dulled by accustomedness to her constant presence
 among them. A premonitory chill, as from some great sorrow yet before her
 in the future, shook the heart of Annie-Many-Ponies.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me, I fine out how moch more yoh want me campa here for pictures," Ramon
 was saying now to Luck who was standing by Pete Lowry, scribbling
 something on his script. "My brother Tomas, he liking for us at ranch now,
 s'pose yoh finish poco tiempo."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck wrote another line before he gave any sign that he heard.
 Annie-Many-Ponies, watching from under her drooping lids, saw that Bill
 Holmes had edged closer to Ramon, while he made pretense of being much
 occupied with his own affairs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't need your camp at all after today." Luck shoved the script into
 his coat pocket and looked at his watch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This afternoon when the sun is just right I want to get one or two
 cut-back scenes and a dissolve out. After that you can break camp any
 time. But I want you, Ramon?you and Estancio Lopez and Luis Rojas.
 I'll need you for two or three days in town?want you to play the
 heavy in a bank-robbery and street fight. The makeup is the same as when
 you worked up there in the rocks the other day. You three fellows come
 over and go in to the ranch tomorrow if you like. Then I'll have you when
 I want you. You'll get five dollars a day while you work." Having made
 himself sufficiently clear, he turned away to set and rehearse the next
 scene, and did not see the careful glance which passed between Ramon and
 Bill Holmes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie," Luck said abruptly, swinging toward her, "can you come down off
 that point where Jean Douglas came? You'll have to ride horseback,
 remember, and I don't want you to do it unless you're sure of yourself.
 How about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For the first time since breakfast her somber eyes lightened with a gleam
 of interest. She did not look at Ramon?Ramon who had told her many
 times how much he loved her, and yet could praise Jean Douglas for her
 riding. Ramon had declared that he would not care to come riding down that
 point as Jean had come; very well, then she would show Ramon something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It isn't necessary, exactly," Luck explained further. "I can show you at
 the top, looking down at the way Jean came; and then I can pick you up on
 an easier trail. But if you want to do it, it will save some cut-backs and
 put another little punch in here. Either way it's up to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The voice of Annie-Many-Ponies did not rise to a higher key when she
 spoke, but it had in it a clear incisiveness that carried her answer to
 Ramon and made him understand that she was speaking for his ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I come down with big punch," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where Jean came? You're riding bareback, remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No matter. I come down jus' same." And she added with a haughty tilt of
 her chin, "That's easy place for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck eyed her steadfastly, a smile of approval on his face. "All right. I
 know you've got plenty of nerve, Annie. You mount and ride up that draw
 till you get to the ridge. Come up to where you can see camp over the brow
 of the hill?sabe??and then wait till I whistle. One whistle,
 get ready to come down. Two whistles, you, come. Ride past camera, just
 the way Jean did. You know you're following the white girl and trying to
 catch up with her. You're a friend and you have a message for her, but
 she's scared and is running away?sabe? You want to come down slow
 first and pick your trail?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No." Annie-Many-Ponies started toward the pinto pony which was her mount
 in this picture. "I come down hill. I make big punch for you. Pete turn
 camera."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've got more nerve than I have, Annie," Jean told her good-naturedly
 as she went by. "I'd hate to run a horse down there bareback."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I go where Wagalexa Conka say." From the corner of her eye she saw the
 quick frown of jealousy upon the face of Ramon, and her pulse gave an
 extra beat of triumph.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With an easy spring she mounted the pinto pony, took the reins of her
 squaw bridle that was her only riding gear, folded her gay blanket snugly
 around her uncorseted body and touched the pinto with her moccasined
 heels. She was ready?ready to the least little tensed nerve that
 tingled with eagerness under the calm surface.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rode slowly past luck, got her few final instructions and a warning to
 be careful and to take no chances of an accident?which brought that
 inscrutable smile to her face; for Wagalexa Conka knew, and she knew also,
 that in the mere act of riding down that slope faster than a walk she was
 taking a chance of an accident. It was that risk that lightened her heart
 which had been so heavy all day. The greater the risk, the more eager was
 she to take it. She would show Ramon that she, too, could ride.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, do be careful, Annie!" Jean called anxiously when she was riding into
 the mouth of the draw. "Turn to the right, when you come to that big flat
 rock, and don't come down where I did. It's too steep. Really," she
 drawled to Rosemary and Lite, "my heart was in my mouth when I came
 straight down by that rock. It's a lot steeper than it looks from here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She won't go round it," Rosemary predicted pessimistically. "She's in one
 of her contrary moods today. She'll come down the worst way she can find
 just to scare the life out of us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Up the steep draw that led to the top, Annie-Many-Ponies rode exultantly.
 She would show Ramon that she could ride wherever the white girl dared
 ride. She would shame Wagalexa Conka, too, for his injustice to her. She
 would put the too, for big punch in that scene or?she would ride no
 more, unless it were upon a white cloud, drifting across the moon at night
 and looking, down at this world and upon Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the top of the ridge she rode out to the edge and made the peace-sign
 to Luck as a signal that she was ready to do his bidding. Incidentally,
 while she held her hand high over her head, her eyes swept keenly the
 bowlder-strewn bluff beneath her. A little to one side was a narrow
 backbone of smoother soil than the rest, and here were printed deep the
 marks of Jean's horse. Even there it was steep, and there was a bank, down
 there by the big flat rock which Jean had mentioned. Annie-Many-Ponies
 looked daringly to the left, where one would say the bluff was impassable.
 There she would come down, and no other place. She would show Ramon what
 she could do?he who had praised boldly another when she was by!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, Annie!" Luck called to her through his megaphone. "Go back now
 and wait for whistle. Ride along the edge when you come, from bushes to
 where you stand. I want silhouette, you coming. You sabe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies raised her hand even with her breast, and swept it out
 and upward in the Indian sign-talk which meant "yes." Luck's eyes flashed
 appreciation of the gesture; he loved the sign-talk of the old plains
 tribes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Be careful, Annie," he cried impulsively. "I don't want you to be hurt."
 He dropped the megaphone as she swung her horse back from the edge and
 disappeared. "I'd cut the whole scene out if I didn't know what a rider
 she is," he added to the others, more uneasy than he cared to own. "But it
 would hurt her a heap more if I wouldn't let her ride where Jean rode.
 She's proud; awfully proud and sensitive."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm glad you're letting her do it," Jean said sympathetically. "She'd
 hate me if you hadn't. But I'm going to watch her with my eyes shut, just
 the same. It's an awfully mean place in spots."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She'll make it, all right," Luck declared. But his tone was not so
 confident as his words, and he was manifestly reluctant to place the
 whistle to his lips. He fussed with his script, and he squinted into the
 viewfinder, and he made certain for the second time just where the
 side-lines came, and thrust half an inch deeper in the sandy soil the
 slender stakes which would tell Annie-Many-Ponies where she must guide the
 pinto when she came tearing down to foreground. But he could delay the
 signal only so long, unless he cut out the scene altogether.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get back, over on that side, Bill," he commanded harshly. "Leave her
 plenty of room to pass that side of the camera. All ready, Pete?" Then, as
 if he wanted to have it over with as soon as possible, he whistled once,
 waited while he might have counted twenty, perhaps, and sent shrilling
 through the sunshine the signal that would bring her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They watched, holding their breaths in fearful expectancy. Then they saw
 her flash into view and come galloping down along the edge of the ridge
 where the hill fell away so steeply that it might be called a cliff.
 Indian fashion, she was whipping the pinto down both sides with the end of
 her reins. Her slim legs hung straight, her moccasined toes pointing
 downward. One corner of her red-and-green striped blanket flapped out
 behind her. Haste?the haste of the pursuer?showed in every
 movement, every line of her figure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came to the descent, and the pinto, having no desire for applause but
 a very great hankering for whole bones in his body, planted his forefeet
 and slid to a stop upon the brink. His snort came clearly down to those
 below who watched.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He won't tackle it," Pete Lowry predicted philosophically while he turned
 the camera crank steadily round and round and held himself ready to
 "panoram" the scene if the pinto bolted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the pinto, having Annie-Many-Ponies to reckon with, did not bolt. The
 braided rein-end of her squaw bridle lashed him stingingly; the moccasined
 heels dug without mercy into the tender part of his flanks. He came
 lunging down over the first rim of the bluff; then since he must, he
 gathered himself for the ordeal and came leaping down and down and down,
 gaining momentum with every jump. He could not have stopped then if he had
 tried?and Annie-Many-Ponies, still the incarnation of eager pursuit,
 would not let him try.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the big flat rock of which Jean had warned her, the pinto would have
 swerved. But she yanked him into the straighter descent, down over the
 bank. He leaped, and he fell and slid twice his own length, his nose
 rooting the soil. Annie-Many-Ponies lurched, came hard against a boulder
 and somehow flung herself into place again on the horse. She lifted his
 head and called to him in short, harsh, Indian words. The pinto scrambled
 to his knees, got to his feet and felt again the sting of the rein-end in
 his flanks. Like a rabbit he came bounding down, down where the way was
 steepest and most treacherous. And at every jump the rein-end fell, first
 on one side and then along the other, as a skilled canoeman shifts the
 paddle to force his slight craft forward in a treacherous current.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down the last slope he came thundering. On his back Annie-Many-Ponies
 lashed him steadily, straining her eyes in the direction which Jean had
 taken past the camera. She knew that they were watching her?she knew
 also that the camera crank in Pete Lowry's hands was turning, turning,
 recording every move of hers, every little changing expression. She swept
 down upon them so close that Pete grabbed the tripod with one hand, ready
 to lift it and dodge away from the coming collision. Still leaning, still
 lashing and straining every nerve in pursuit, she dashed past, pivoted the
 pinto upon his hind feet, darted back toward the staring group and jumped
 off while he was yet running.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now that she had done it; now that she had proven that she also had nerve
 and much skill in riding, black loneliness settled upon her again. She
 came slowly back, and as she came she heard them praise the ride she had
 made. She heard them saying how frightened they had been when the pinto
 fell, and she heard Wagalexa Conka call to her that she had made a strong
 scene for him. She did not answer. She sat down upon a rock, a little
 apart from them, and looking as remote as the Sandias Mountains, miles
 away to the north, folded her blanket around her and spoke no word to
 anyone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon Ramon mounted his horse to return to his camp. He came riding down to
 her?for his trail lay that way?and as he rode he called to the
 others a good natured "Hasta luego!" which is the Mexican equivalent of
 "See you later." He did not seem to notice Annie-Many-Ponies at all as he
 rode past her. He was gazing off down the arroyo and riding with all his
 weight on one stirrup and the other foot swinging free, as is the
 nonchalant way of accustomed riders who would ease their muscles now and
 then. But as he passed the rock where she was sitting he murmured,
 "Tonight by the rock I wait for you, querida mia." Though she gave no sign
 that she had heard, the heart of Annie-Many-Ponies gave a throb of
 gladness that was almost pain.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII. ADVENTURE COMES SMILING
 </h2>
 <p>
 Luck, in the course of his enthusiastic picture making, reached the point
 where he must find a bank that was willing to be robbed?in broad
 daylight and for screen purposes only. If you know anything at all about
 our financial storehouses, you know that they are sensitive about being
 robbed, or even having it appear that they are being subjected to so
 humiliating a procedure. What Luck needed was a bank that was not only
 willing, but one that faced the sun as well. He was lucky, as usual. The
 Bernalillo County Bank stands on a corner facing east and south. It is an
 unpretentious little bank of the older style of architecture, and might
 well be located in the centre of any small range town and hold the
 shipping receipts of a cattleman who was growing rich as he grew old.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck stopped across the street and looked the bank over, and saw how the
 sun would shine in at the door and through the wide windows during the
 greater part of the afternoon, and hoped that the cashier was a human
 being and would not object to a fake robbery. Not liking suspense, he
 stepped off the pavement and dodged a jitney, and hurried over to
 interview the cashier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 You never know what secret ambitions hide behind the impassive courtesy of
 the average business man. This cashier, for instance, wore a green
 eyeshade whenever his hat was not on his, head. His hair was thin and his
 complexion pasty and his shoulders were too stooped for a man of his age.
 You never would have suspected, just to look at him through the fancy
 grating of his window, how he thirsted for that kind of adventure which
 fiction writers call red-blooded. He had never had an adventure in his
 life; but at night, after he had gone to bed and adjusted the electric
 light at his head, and his green eyeshade, and had put two pillows under
 the back of his neck, he read?you will scarcely believe it, but it
 is true?he read about the James boys and Kit. Carson and Pawnee
 Bill, and he could tell you?only he wouldn't mention it, of course?just
 how many Texans were killed in the Alamo. He loved gun catalogues, and he
 frequently went out of his way to pass a store that displayed real,
 business-looking stock-saddles and quirts and spurs and things. He longed
 to be down in Mexico in the thick of the scrap there, and he knew every
 prominent Federal leader and every revolutionist that got into the papers;
 knew them by spelling at least, even if he couldn't pronounce the names
 correctly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had come to Albuquerque for his lungs' sake a few years ago, and he
 still thrilled at the sight of bright-shawled Pueblo Indians padding along
 the pavements in their moccasins and queer leggings that looked like
 joints of whitewashed stove-pipe; while to ride in an automobile out to
 Isleta, which is a terribly realistic Indian village of adobe huts, made
 the blood beat in his temples and his fingers tremble upon his knees. Even
 Martinez Town with its squatty houses and narrow streets held for him a
 peculiar fascination.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 You can imagine, maybe, how his weak eyes snapped with excitement under
 that misleading green shade when Luck Lindsay walked in and smiled at him
 through the wicket, and explained who he was and what was the favor he had
 come to ask of the bank. You can, perhaps, imagine how he stood and made
 little marks on a blotter with his pencil while Luck explained just what
 he would want; and how he clung to the noncommittal manner which is a
 cashier's professional shield, while Luck smiled his smile to cover his
 own feeling of doubt and stated that he merely wanted two Mexicans to
 enter, presumably overpower the cashier, and depart with a bag or two of
 gold.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cashier made a few more pencil marks and said that it might be
 arranged, if Luck could find it convenient to make the picture just after
 the bank's closing time. Obviously the cashier could not permit the bank's
 patrons to be disturbed in any way?but what he really wanted was to
 have the thrill of the adventure all to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With the two of them anxious to have the pictured robbery take place, of
 course they arranged it after a polite sparring on the part of the
 cashier, whose craving for adventure was carefully guarded as a guilty
 secret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At three o'clock the next day, then?although Luck would have greatly
 preferred an earlier hour?the cashier had the bank cleared of
 patrons and superfluous clerks, and was watching, with his nerves all
 atingle and the sun shining in upon him through a side window, while Pete
 Lowry and Bill Holmes fussed outside with the camera, getting ready for
 the arrival of those realistic bandits, Ramon Chavez and Luis Rojas. On
 the street corner opposite, the Happy Family foregathered clannishly,
 waiting until they were called into the street-fight scene which Luck
 meant to make later.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cashier's cheeks were quite pink with excitement when finally Ramon
 and the Rojas villain walked past the window and looked in at him before
 going on to the door. He was disappointed because they were not masked,
 and because they did not wear bright sashes with fringe and striped
 serapes draped across their shoulders, and the hilts of wicked knives
 showing somewhere. They did not look like bandits at all?thanks to
 Luck's sure knowledge and fine sense of realism. Still, they answered the
 purpose, and when they opened the door and came in the cashier got quite a
 start from the greedy look in their eyes when they saw the gold he had
 stacked in profusion on the counter before him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They made the scene twice?the walking past the window and coming in
 at the door; and the second time Luck swore at them because they stopped
 too abruptly at the window and lingered too long there, looking in at the
 cashier and his gold, and exchanging meaning glances before they went to
 the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Later, there was an interior scene with reflectors almost blinding the
 cashier while he struggled self-consciously and ineffectually with Ramon
 Chavez. The gold that Ramon scraped from the cashier's keeping into his
 own was not, of course, the real gold which the bandits had seen through
 the window. Luck, careful of his responsibilities, had waited while the
 cashier locked the bank's money in the vault, and had replaced it with
 brass coins that looked real?to the camera.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The cashier lived then the biggest moments of his life. He was forced upon
 his back across a desk that had been carefully cleared of the bank's
 papers and as carefully strewn with worthless ones which Luck had brought.
 A realistically uncomfortable gag had been forced into the mouth of the
 cashier?where it brought twinges from some fresh dental work, by the
 way?and the bandits had taken everything in sight that they fancied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon and Luis Rojas had proven themselves artists in this particular line
 of work, and the cashier, when it was all over and the camera and company
 were busily at work elsewhere, lived it in his imagination and felt that
 he was at least tasting the full flavor of red-blooded adventure without
 having to pay the usual price of bitterness and bodily suffering. He was
 mistaken, of course?as I am going to explain. What the cashier had
 taken part in was not the adventure itself but merely a rehearsal and
 general preparation for the real performance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This had been on Wednesday, just after three o'clock in the afternoon. On
 Saturday forenoon the cashier was called upon the phone and asked if a
 part of that robbery stuff could be retaken that day. The cashier thrilled
 instantly at the thought of it. Certainly, they could retake as much as
 they pleased. Lucks voice?or a voice very like Luck's?thanked
 him and said that they would not need to retake the interior stuff. What
 he wanted was to get the approach to the bank the entrance and going back
 to the cashier. That part of the negative was under-timed, said the voice.
 And would the cashier make a display of gold behind the wicket, so that
 the camera could register it through the window? The cashier thought that
 he could. "Just stack it up good and high," directed the voice. "The more
 the better. And clear the bank?have the clerks out, and every thing
 as near as possible to what it was the other day. And you take up the same
 position. The scene ends where Ramon comes back and grabs you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And listen! You did so well the other day that I'm going to leave this to
 you, to see that they get it the same. I can't be there myself?I've
 got to catch some atmosphere stuff down here in Old Town. I'm just sending
 my assistant camera man and the two heavies and my scenic artist for this
 retake. It won't be much?but be sure you have the bank cleared, old
 man?because it would ruin the following scenes to have extra people
 registered in this; see? You did such dandy work in that struggle that I
 want it to stand. Boy, your work's sure going to stand out on the screen!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Can you blame the cashier for drinking in every word of that, and for
 emptying the vault of gold and stacking it up in beautiful, high piles
 where the sun shone on it through the window?and where it would be
 within easy reach, by the way!?so that the camera could "register"
 it?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At ten minutes past twelve he had gotten rid of patrons and clerks, and he
 had the gold out and his green eyeshade adjusted as becomingly as a green
 eyeshade may be adjusted. He looked out and saw that the street was
 practically empty, because of the hour and the heat that was almost
 intolerable where the sun shone full. He saw a big red machine drive up to
 the corner and stop, and he saw a man climb out with camera already
 screwed, to the tripod. He saw the bandits throw away their cigarettes and
 follow the camera man, and then he hurried back and took up his station
 beside the stacks of gold, and waited in a twitter of excitement for this
 unhoped-for encore of last Wednesday's glorious performance. Through the
 window he watched the camera being set up, and he watched also, from under
 his eyeshade, the approach of the two bandits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From there on a gap occurs in the cashier's memory of that day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon and Luis went into the bank, and in a few minutes they came out
 again burdened with bags of specie and pulled the door shut with the
 spring lock set and the blinds down that proclaimed the bank was closed.
 They climbed into the red automobile, the camera and its operator
 followed, and the machine went away down the street to the post-office,
 turned and went purring into the Mexican quarter which spreads itself out
 toward the lower bridge that spans the Rio Grande. This much a dozen
 persons could tell you. Beyond that no man seemed to know what became of
 the outfit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the bank, the cashier lay back across a desk with a gag in his mouth
 and his hands and feet tied, and with a welt on the side of his head that
 swelled and bled sluggishly for a while and then stopped and became an
 angry purple. Where the gold had been stacked high in the sunshine the
 marble glistened whitely, with not so much as a five-dollar piece to give
 it a touch of color. The window blinds were drawn down?the bank was
 closed. And people passed the windows and never guessed that within there
 lay a sickly young man who had craved adventure and found it, and would
 presently awake to taste its bitter flavor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Away off across the mesa, sweltering among the rocks in Bear Canon, Luck
 Lindsay panted and sweated and cussed the heat and painstakingly directed
 his scenes, and never dreamed that a likeness of his voice had beguiled
 the cashier of the Bernalillo County Bank into consenting to be robbed and
 beaten into oblivion of his betrayal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And?although some heartless teller of tales might keep you in the
 dark about this?the red automobile, having dodged hurriedly into a
 high-boarded enclosure behind a Mexican saloon, emerged presently and went
 boldly off across the bridge and up through Atrisco to the sand hills
 which is the beginning of the desert off that way. But another automobile,
 bigger and more powerful and black, slipped out of this same enclosure
 upon another street, and turned eastward instead of west. This machine
 made for the mesa by a somewhat roundabout course, and emerged, by way of
 a rough trail up a certain draw in the edge of the tableland, to the main
 road where it turns the corner of the cemetery. From there the driver
 drove as fast as he dared until he reached the hill that borders Tijeras
 Arroyo. There being no sign of pursuit to this point, he crossed the
 Arroyo at a more leisurely pace. Then he went speeding away into the edge
 of the mountains until they reached one of those deep, deserted dry washes
 that cut the foothills here and there near Coyote Springs. There his
 passengers left him and disappeared up the dry wash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before the wound on the cashier's head had stopped bleeding, the black
 automobile was returning innocently to town and no man guessed what
 business had called it out upon the mesa.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII. THE SONG OF THE OMAHA
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Me, I theenk yoh not lov' me so moch as a pin," Ramon complained in soft
 reproach, down in the dry wash where Applehead had looked in vain for
 baling wire. "Sometimes I show yoh what is like the Spanish lov'. Like
 stars, like fire?sometimes I seeng the jota for you that tell how
 moch I lov' yoh. 'Te quiero, Baturra, te quiero,'" he began humming softly
 while he looked at her with eyes that shone soft in the starlight.
 "Sometimes me, I learn yoh dat song?and moch more I learn yoh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies stood before him, straight and slim and with that air of
 aloofness which so fired Ramon's desire for her. She lifted a hand to
 check him, and Ramon stopped instantly and waited. So far had her power
 over him grown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All time you tell me you heap love," she said in her crooning soft voice.
 "Why you not talk of priest to make us marry? You say words for love?you
 say no word for wife. Why you no say?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Esposa!" Ramon's teeth gleamed white as a wolf's in the dusk. "When the
 padre marry us I maybe teach you many ways to say wife!" He laughed under
 his breath. "How I calls yoh wife when I not gets one kees, me? Now I
 calls yoh la sweetheart?good enough when I no gets so moch as
 touches hand weeth yoh."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I go way with you, you gets priest for make us marry?" Annie-Many-Ponies
 edged closer so that she might read what was in his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why yoh no trus' Ramon? Sure, I gets padre! W'at yoh theenk for speak
 lies, me? Sure, I gets padre, foolish one! Me, I not like for yoh no trus'
 Ramon. Looks like not moch yoh lov' Ramon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I good girl," Annie-Many-Ponies stated simply. "I love my husband when
 priest says that's right thing to do. You no gets priest, I no go with
 you. I think mens not much cares for marry all time. Womens not care, they
 go to hell. That's what priest tells. Girls got to care. That's truth."
 Simple as two-plus-two was the rule of life as Annie-Many-Ponies laid it
 down in words before him. No fine distinctions between virtue and
 superwomanhood there, if you please! No slurring of wrong so that it may
 look like an exalted right. "Womens got to care," said Annie-Many-Ponies
 with a calm certainty that would brook no argument.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure theeng," Ramon agreed easily. "Yoh theenk I lov' yoh so moch if yoh
 not good?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You gets priest?" Annie-Many-Ponies persisted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure, I gets padre. You theenk Ramon lies for soch theeng?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You swear, then, all same white mans in picture makes oath." There was a
 new quality of inflexibility under the soft music of her voice. "You lift
 up hand and says, 'Help me by God I makes you for-sure my wife!'" She had
 pondered long upon this oath, and she spoke it now with an easy certainty
 that it was absolutely binding, and that no man would dare break it. "You
 makes that swear now," she urged gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Foolish one! Yoh theenk I mus' swear I do what my hearts she's want? I
 tell yoh many times we go on one ranch my brother Tomas says she's be
 mine. We lives there in fine house weeth mooch flowers, yoh not so moch as
 lif' one finger for work, querida mia. Yoh theenk I not be trus', me,
 Ramon what loves yoh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No hurt for swears what I tells," Annie-Many-Ponies stepped back from him
 a pace, distrust creeping into her voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right." Ramon moved nearer. "So I make oath, perhaps you make oath
 also! Me, I theenk yoh perhaps not like for leave Luck Leensay?I
 theenk perhaps yoh loves heem, yoh so all time watch for ways to please!
 So I swear, then yoh mus' swear also that yoh come for-sure. That square
 deal for both?si?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies hesitated, a dull ache in her breast when Ramon spoke of
 Luck. But if her heart was sore at thought of him, it was because he no
 longer looked upon her with the smile in his eyes. It was because he was
 not so kind; because he believed that she had secret meetings with Bill
 Holmes whom she hated. And in spite of the fact that Bill Holmes had left
 the company the other day and was going away, Wagalexa Conka still looked
 upon her with cold eyes and listened to the things that Applehead said
 against her. The heart of Wagalexa Conka, she told herself miserably, was
 like a stone for her. And so her own heart must be hard. She would swear
 to Ramon, and she would keep the oath?and Wagalexa Conka would not
 even miss her or be sorry that she had gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First you make swears like I tells you," she said. "Then I make swears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Muy bueno!" smiled Ramon then. "So I make oath I take you queek to one
 good friend me, the Padre Dominguez. Then yoh be my wife for sure. That
 good enough for yoh, perhaps? Queeck yoh make oath yoh leave these place
 Manana?tomorra. Yoh go by ol' rancho where we talk so many time. I
 leave horse for yoh. Yoh ride pas' that mountain, yoh come for Bernalillo.
 Yoh wait. I come queeck as can when she's dark. Yoh do that, sweetheart?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies stilled the ache in her heart with the thought of her
 proud place beside Ramon who had much land and many cattle and who loved
 her so much. She lifted her hand and swore she would go with him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She slipped away then and crept into her tent in the little cluster beside
 the house?for the company 'had forsaken Applehead's adobe and slept
 under canvas as a matter of choice. With Indian cunning she bided her time
 and gave no sign of what was hidden in her heart. She rose with the others
 and brushed her glossy hair until it shone in the sunlight like the hair
 of a high-caste Chinese woman. She tied upon it the new bows of red ribbon
 which she had bought in the secret hope that they would be a part of her
 wedding finery. She put on her Indian gala dress of beaded buckskin with
 the colored porcupine quills?and then she smiled cunningly and drew
 a dress of red-and-blue striped calico over her head and settled the folds
 of it about her with little, smoothing pats, so that the two white women,
 Rosemary and Jean, should not notice any unusual bulkiness of her figure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She did not know how she would manage to escape the keen eyes of Wagalexa
 Conka and to steal away from the ranch, especially if she had to work in
 the picture that day. But Luck unconsciously opened wide the trail for
 her. He announced at breakfast that they would work up in Bear Canon that
 day, and that he would not need Jean or Annie either; and that, as it
 would be hotter than the hinges of Gehenna up in that canon, they had
 better stay at home and enjoy themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not betray by so much as a flicker of the lashes
 that she heard him much less that it was the best of good news to her. She
 went into her tent and packed all of her clothes into a bundle which she
 wrapped in her plaid shawl, and was proud because the bundle was so big,
 and because she had much fine beadwork and so many red ribbons, and a
 waist of bright blue silk which she would wear when she stood before the
 priest, if Ramon did not like the dress of beaded buckskin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A ring with an immense red stone in it which Ramon had given her, she
 slipped upon her finger with her little, inscrutable smile. She was
 engaged to be married, now, just like white girls; and tomorrow she would
 have a wide ring of shiny gold for that finger, and should be the wife of
 Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Just then Shunka Chistala, lying outside her tent, flapped his tail on the
 ground and gave a little, eager whine. Annie-Many-Ponies thrust her head
 through the opening and looked out, and then stepped over the little black
 dog and stood before her tent to watch the Happy Family mount and ride
 away with Wagalexa Conka in their midst and with the mountain wagon
 rattling after them loaded with "props" and the camera and the noonday
 lunch and Pete Lowry and Tommy Johnson, the scenic artist. Applehead was
 going to drive the wagon, and she scowled when he yanked off the brake and
 cracked the whip over the team.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck, feeling perchance the intensity of her gaze, turned in the saddle
 and looked back. The eyes of Annie-Many-Ponies softened and saddened,
 because this was the last time she would see Wagalexa Conka riding away to
 make pictures?the last time she would see him. She lifted her hand,
 and made the Indian sign of farewell?the peace-go-with-you sign that
 is used for solemn occasions of parting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck pulled up short and stared. What did she mean by that? He reined his
 horse around, half minded to ride back and ask her why she gave him that
 peace-sign. She had never done it before, except once or twice in scenes
 that he directed. But after all he did not go. They were late in getting
 started that morning, which irked his energetic soul; and women's whims
 never did impress Luck Lindsay very deeply. Besides, just as he was
 turning to ride back, Annie stooped and went into her tent as though her
 gesture had carried no especial meaning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then in her tent he heard her singing the high, weird chant of the Omaha
 mourning song and again he was half-minded to go back, though the wailing
 minor notes, long drawn and mournful, might mean much or they might mean
 merely a fit of the blues. The others rode on talking and laughing
 together, and Luck rode with them; but the chant of the Omaha was in his
 ears and tingling his nerves. And the vision of Annie-Many-Ponies standing
 straight before her tent and making the sign of peace and farewell haunted
 him that day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rosemary and Jean, standing in the porch, waved good-bye to their men folk
 until the last bobbing hatcrown had gone down out of sight in the long,
 low swale that creased the mesa in that direction. Whereupon they went
 into the house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What in the world is the matter with Annie?" Jean exploded, with a little
 shiver. "I'd rather hear a band of gray wolves tune up when you're caught
 out in the breaks and have to ride in the dark. What is that caterwaul? Do
 you suppose she's on the warpath or anything?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, that's just the squaw coming out in her!" Rosemary slammed the door
 shut so they could not hear so plainly. "She's getting more Injuny every
 day of her life. I used to try and treat her like a white girl?but
 you just can't do it, Jean."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hiu-hiu-hi-i-ah-h! Hiu-hiu-hi-i-ah-h-h?hiaaa-h-h!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jean stood in the middle of the room and listened. "Br-r-r!" she shivered?and
 one could not blame her. "I wonder if she'd be mad," she drawled, "if I
 went out and told her to shut up. It sounds as if somebody was dead, or
 going to die or something. Like Lite says your dog will howl if anything?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, for pity sake!" Rosemary pushed her into the living room with
 make-believe savageness. "I've heard her and Luck sing that last winter.
 And there's a kind of a teetery dance that goes with it. It's supposed to
 be a mourning song, as Luck explains it. But don't pay any attention to
 her at all. She just does it to get on our nerves. It'd tickle her to
 death if she thought it made us nervous."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And now the dog is joining in on the chorus! I must say they're a
 cheerful pair to have around the house. And I know one thing?if they
 keep that up much longer, I'll either get out there with a gun, or saddle
 up and follow the boys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd tease us to death, Jean, if we let Annie run us out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's run or be run," Jean retorted irritatedly. "I wanted to write poetry
 today?I thought of an awfully striking sentence about the?for
 heaven's sake, where's a shotgun?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Jean, you wouldn't!" Rosemary, I may here explain, was very femininely
 afraid of guns. "She'd?why, there's no telling WHAT she might do!
 Luck says she carries a knife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What if she does? She ought to carry a few bird-shot, too. She's got
 nothing to mourn about?nobody's died, has there?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hiu-hiu-hia-a-a,ah! Hia-a-a-a-ah!" wailed Annie-Many-Ponies in her tent,
 because she would never again look upon the face of Wagalexa Conka?or
 if she did it would be to see his anger blaze and burn her heart to ashes.
 To her it was as though death sat beside her; the death of Wagalexa
 Conka's friendship for her. She forgot his harshness because he thought
 her disobedient and wicked. She forgot that she loved Ramon Chavez, and
 that he was rich and would give her a fine home and much love. She forgot
 everything but that she had sworn an oath and that she must keep it though
 it killed faith and kindness and friendship as with a knife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So she wailed, in high-keyed, minor chanting unearthly in its primitive
 inarticulateness of sorrow, the chant of the Omaha mourning song. So had
 her tribe wailed in the olden days when warriors returned to the villages
 and told of their dead. So had her mother wailed when the Great Spirit
 took away her first man-child. So had the squaws wailed in their tepees
 since the land was young. And the little black dog, sitting on his
 haunches before her door, pointed his moist nose into the sunlight and
 howled in mournful sympathy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my gracious!" Jean, usually so calm, flung a magazine against the
 wall. "This is just about as pleasant as a hanging! let's saddle up and
 ride in after the mail, Rosemary. Maybe the squaw in her will be howled
 out by the time we get back." And she added with a venomous sincerity that
 would have warmed the heart of old Applehead, "I'd shoot that dog, for
 half a cent! How do you suppose an animal of his size can produce all that
 noise?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I don't know!" Rosemary spoke with the patience of utter weariness.
 "I've stood her and the dog for about eight months and I'm getting kind of
 hardened to it. But I never did hear them go on like that before. You'd
 think all her relations were being murdered, wouldn't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Jean was busy getting into her riding clothes and did not say what she
 thought; but you may be sure that it was antipathetic to the grief of
 Annie-Many-Ponies, and that Jean's attitude was caused by a complete lack
 of understanding. Which, if you will stop to think, is true of half the
 unsympathetic attitudes in the world. Because they did not understand, the
 two dressed hastily and tucked their purses safely inside their
 shirtwaists and saddled and rode away to town. And the last they heard as
 they put the ranch behind them was the wailing chant of Annie-Many-Ponies
 and the prodigious, long-drawn howling of the little black dog.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, hearing the beat of hoofs ceased her chanting and
 looked out in time to see the girls just disappearing over the low brow of
 the hill. She stood for a moment and stared after them with frowning
 brows. Rosemary she did not like and never would like, after their hidden
 feud of months over such small matters as the cat and the dog, and unswept
 floors, and the like. A mountain of unwashed dishes stood between these
 two, as it were, and forbade anything like friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the parting that was at hand had brushed aside her jealousy of Jean as
 leading woman. Intuitively she knew that with any encouragement Jean would
 have been her friend. Oddly, she remembered now that Jean had been the
 first to ask for her when she came to the ranch. So, although Jean would
 never know, Annie-Many-Ponies raised her hand and gave the
 peace-and-farewell sign of the plains Indians.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The way was open now, and she must go. She had sworn that she would meet
 Ramon?but oh, the heart of her was heavier than the bundle which she
 bound with her bright red sash and lifted to her shoulders with the sash
 drawn across her chest and shoulders. So had the women of her tribe borne
 burdens since the land was young; but none had ever borne a heavier load
 than did Annie-Many-Ponies when she went soft footed across the open space
 to the dry wash and down that to another, and so on and on until she
 crossed the low ridge and came down to the deserted old rancho with its
 crumbling adobe cabins and the well where she had waited so often for
 Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was tired when she reached the well, for her back was not used to
 burden-bearing as had been her mother's, and her steps had lagged because
 of the heaviness that was in her chest. It seemed to her that some bad
 spirit was driving her forth an exile. She could not understand, last
 night she had been glad at the thought of going, and if the thought of
 leaving Wagalexa Conka so treacherously had hurt like a knife-thrust,
 still, she had sworn willingly enough that she would go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The horse was there, saddled and tied in a tumble-down shed just as Ramon
 had promised that it would be. Annie-Many-Ponies did not mount and ride on
 immediately, however. It was still early in the forenoon, and she was not
 so eager in reality as she had been in anticipation. She sat down beside
 the well and stared somberly away to the mountains, and wondered why she
 was go sad when she should be happy. She twisted the ring with the big red
 stone round and round her finger, but she got no pleasure from the crimson
 glow of it. The stone looked to her now like a great, frozen drop of
 blood. She wondered grimly whose blood it was, and stared at it strangely
 before her eyes went again worshipfully to the mountains which she loved
 and which she must leave and perhaps never see again as they looked from
 there, and from the ranch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She must ride and ride until she was around on the other side of that last
 one that had the funny, pointed cone top like a big stone tepee. On the
 other side was Ramon, and the priest, and the strange new life of which
 she was beginning to feel afraid. There would be no more riding up to
 camera, laughing or sighing or frowning as Wagalexa Conka commanded her to
 do. There would be no more shy greetings of the slim young woman in riding
 skirt?the friendship scenes and the black-browed anger, while Pete
 Lowry turned the camera and Luck stood beside him telling her just what
 she must do, and smiling at her when she did it well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There would be Ramon, and the priest and the wide ring of shiny gold?what
 more? The mountains, all pink and violet and smiling green and soft gray?the
 mountains hid the new life from her. And she must ride around that last,
 sharp-pointed one, and come into the new life that was on the other side?and
 what if it should be bitter? What if Ramon's love did not live beyond the
 wide ring of shiny gold? She had seen it so, with other men and other
 maids.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No matter. She had sworn the oath that she would go. But first, there at
 the old well where Ramon had taught her the Spanish love words, there
 where she had listened shyly and happily to his voice that was so soft and
 so steeped in love, Annie-Many-Ponies stood up with her face to the
 mountains and sorrow in her eyes, and chanted again the wailing, Omaha
 mourning-song. And just behind her the little black dog, that had followed
 close to her heels all the way, sat upon his haunches and pointed his nose
 to the sky and howled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For a long time she wailed. Then to the mountains that she loved she made
 the sign of peace-and-farewell, and turned herself stoically to the
 keeping of her oath. Her bundle that was so big and heavy she placed in
 the saddle and fastened with the saddle-string and with the red sash that
 had bound it across her chest and shoulders. Then, as her great
 grandmother had plodded across the bleak plains of the Dakotas at her
 master's behest, Annie-Many-Ponies took the bridle reins and led the horse
 out of the ruin, and started upon her plodding, patient journey to what
 lay beyond the mountains. Behind her the black horse walked with drooping
 head, half asleep in the warm sunlight. At the heels of the horse followed
 the little black dog.

 CHAPTER IX. RIDERS IN THE BACKGROUND
 </h2>
 <p>
 Luck, as explained elsewhere, was sweating and swearing at the heat in
 Bear Canon. The sun had crept around so that it shone full into a certain
 bowlder-strewn defile, and up this sunbaked gash old Applehead was
 toiling, leading the scrawniest burro which Luck had been able to find in
 the country. The burro was packed with a prospector's outfit startlingly
 real in its pathetic meagerness. Old Applehead was picking his way among
 rocks so hot that he could hardly bear to lay his bare hand upon them,
 tough as that hand was with years of exposure to heat and cold alike.
 Beads of perspiration were standing on his face, which was a deep,
 apoplectic crimson, and little trickles of sweat were dropping off his
 lower jaw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was muttering as he climbed, but the camera fortunately failed to
 record the language that he used. Now and then he turned and yanked
 savagely at the lead rope; whereupon the burro would sit down upon its
 haunches and allow Applehead to stretch its neck as far as bone and tough
 hide and tougher sinew would permit Someone among the group roosting in
 the shade across the defile and well out of camera range would laugh, and
 Luck, standing on a ledge just behind and above the camera, would shout
 directions or criticism of the "business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on back, Applehead," Luck yelled when the "prospectorp" had turned a
 corner of rock and disappeared from sight of the camera. "We'll do that
 scene over once more before the sun gets too far around."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do it over, will ye?" Applehead snarled as he came toiling obediently
 back down the gulch. "Well, now, I ain't so danged shore about that there
 doin' over?'nless yuh want to wait and do it after sundown. Ain't
 nobody but a danged fool It would go trailin' up that there gulch this
 kinda' day. Them rocks up there is hot enough to brile a lizard?now,
 I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck covered a smile with his moist palm. He could not afford to be
 merciful at the expense of good "picture-stuff," however, so he called
 down grimly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now you're just about fagged enough for that close-up I want of you,
 Applehead. You went up that gulch a shade too brisk for a fellow that's
 all in from traveling, and starved into the bargain. Come back down here
 by this sand bank, and start up towards camera. Back up a little, Pete, so
 you can 'pam' his approach. I want to get him pulling his burro up past
 that bank?sabe? And the close-up of his face with all those
 sweat-streaks will prove how far he's come?and then I want the
 detail of that burro and his pack which you'll get as they go by. You see
 what I mean. Let's see. Will it swing you too far into the sun, Pete, if
 you pick him up down there in that dry channel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not if you let me make it right away," Pete replied after a squint or two
 through the viewfinder. "Sun's getting pretty far over?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ought to leave a feller time to git his wind," Applehead complained,
 looking up at Luck with eyes bloodshot from the heat. "I calc'late mebby
 you think it's FUN to drag that there burro up over them rocks?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure, it isn't fun. We didn't come out here for fun. Go down and wait
 behind that bank, and come out into the channel when I give the word. I
 want you coming up all-in, just as you look right now. Sorry, but I can't
 let you wait to cool off, Applehead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well now," Applehead began with shortwinded sarcasm, "I'm s'posed to be
 outa grub. Why didn't yuh up In' starve me fer a week or two, so'st I'd be
 gaunted up realistic? Why didn't yuh break a laig fer me, sos't I kin show
 some five-cent bunch in a pitcher-show how bad I'm off? Danged if I ain't
 jest about gettin' my hide full uh this here danged fool REELISM you're
 hollerin' fur all the time. 'F you send me down there to come haulin' that
 there burro back up here so's the camery kin watch me sweat 'n' puff my
 danged daylights out?before I git a drink uh water, I'll murder ye
 in cold blood, now I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You go on down there and shut up!" Luck yelled inexorably. "You can drink
 a barrel when I'm through with this scene?and not before. Get that?
 My Lord! If you can't lead a burro a hundred yards without setting down
 and fanning yourself to sleep, you must be losing your grip for fair. I'll
 stake you to a rocking-chair and let you do old grandpa parts, if you
 aren't able to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dang you, Luck, if you wasn't such a little runt I'd come up there and
 jest about lick the pants off you! Talk that way to ME, will ye? I'll have
 ye know I kin lead burros with you or any other dang man, heat er no heat
 Ef yuh ain't got no more heart'n to AST it of me, I'll haul this here
 burro up 'n' down this dang gulch till there ain't nothin' left of 'im but
 the lead-rope, and the rocks is all wore down to cobble-stone! Ole grandpa
 parts, hey? You'll swaller them words when I git to ye, young feller?and
 you'll swaller 'em mighty dang quick, now I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He went off down the gulch to the sand bank. The Happy Family, sprawled at
 ease in the shade, took cigarettes from their lips that they might chortle
 their amusement at the two. Like father and son were Applehead and Luck,
 but their bickerings certainly would never lead one to suspect their
 affection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Get that darned burro outa sight, will you?" Luck bawled impatiently when
 Applehead paused to send a murderous glance back toward camera. "What's
 the matter?yuh PARALYZED down there? Haul him in behind that bank!
 The moon'll be up before you get turned around, at that rate!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shet yore haid!" Applehead retorted at the full capacity of his lungs
 and with an absolute disregard for Luck's position as director of the
 company. "Who's leadin' this here burro?you er me? Fer two cents I'd
 come back and knock the tar outa you, Luck! Stand up there on a rock and
 flop your wings and crow like a danged banty rooster?'n' I was
 leadin' burros 'fore you was born! I'd like to know who yuh think you BE?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pete Lowry, standing feet-apart and imperturbably focussing the camera
 while the two yelled insults at each other, looked up at Luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Riders in the background," he announced laconically, and returned to his
 squinting and fussing. "Maybe you can make 'em hear with the megaphone,"
 he hinted, looking again at Luck. "They're riding straight up the canon,
 in the middle distance. They'll register in the scene, if you can't turn
 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Applehead!" Luck called through the megaphone to his irritated
 prospector. "Get those riders outa the canon?they're in the scene!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead promptly appeared, glaring up at luck. "Well, now, if I've got
 to haul this here dang jackass up this dang gulch, I cal'clate that'll be
 about job enough for one man," he yelled. "How yuh expect me t' go two
 ways 't once? Hey? Yuh figured that out yit?" He turned then for a look at
 the interrupting strangers, and immediately they saw his manner change. He
 straightened up, and his right hand crept back significantly toward his
 hip. Applehead, I may here explain, was an ex-sheriff, and what range men
 call a "go-getter." He had notches on the ivory handle of his gun?three
 of them. In fair fights and in upholding the law he had killed, and he
 would kill again if the need ever arose, as those who knew him never
 doubted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck, seeing that backward movement of the hand, unconsciously hitched his
 own gun into position on his hip and came down off his rock ledge with one
 leap. Just as instinctively the Happy Family scrambled out of the shade
 and followed luck down the gulch to where Applehead stood facing down the
 canon, watchfulness in every tense line of his lank figure. Tommy Johnson,
 who never seemed to be greatly interested in anything save his work, got
 up from where he lay close beside the camera tripod and went over to the
 other side of the gulch where he could see plainer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Like a hunter poising his shotgun and making ready when his trained
 bird-dog points, Luck walked guardedly down the gulch to where Applehead
 stood watching the horsemen who had for the moment passed out of sight of
 those above.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, what's that danged shurf want, prowlin' up HERE with a couple uh
 depittys?" Applehead grumbled when he heard Luck's footsteps crunching
 behind him. "Uh course," he added grimly, "he MIGHT be viewin' the scenery?but
 it's dang pore weather fur pleasure-ridin', now I'm tellin' ye! Them a
 comin' up here don't look good to ME, Luck?'n' if they ain't?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you know it's the sheriff?" Luck for no reason whatever felt a
 sudden heaviness of spirit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey? Think my eyes is failin' me?" Applehead gave him a sidelong glance
 of hasty indignation. "I'd know ole Hank Miller a mile off with m' eyes
 shet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By then the three riders rode out into plain view. Perhaps the sight of
 Luck and Applehead standing there awaiting their arrival, with the whole
 Happy Family and Big Aleck Douglas and Lite Avery moving down in a
 close-bunched, expectant group behind the two, was construed as hostility
 rather than curiosity. At any rate the sheriff and his deputies shifted
 meaningly in their saddles and came up sour-faced and grim, and with their
 guns out and pointing at the group.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't go making any foolish play, boys," the sheriff warned. "We don't
 want trouble?we aren't looking for any. But we ain't taking any
 chances."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well now, you're takin' a dang long chance, Hank Miller, when yuh come
 ridin' up on us fellers like yuh was cornerin' a bunch uh outlaws,"
 Applehead exploded. But Luck pushed him aside and stepped to the front.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nobody's making any foolish play but you," he answered the sheriff
 calmly. "You may not know it, but you're blocking my scene and the light's
 going. If you've got any business with me or my company, get it over and
 then get out so we aim make this scene. What d'yuh want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You," snapped the sheriff. "You and your bunch."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me?" Luck took a step forward. "What for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For pulling off that robbery at the bank today." The sheriff could be
 pretty blunt, and he shot the charge straight, without any quibbling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck looked a little blank; and old Applehead, shaking with a very real
 anger now, shoved Luck away and stepped up where he could shake his fist
 under the sheriff's nose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We don't know, and we don't give a cuss, what you're aimin' at," he
 thundered. "We been out here workin' in this brilin' sun sense nine
 o'clock this mornin'. Luck ain't robbed no bank, ner he ain't the kind
 that DOES rob banks, and I'm here to see you swaller them words 'fore I
 haul ye off'n that horse and plumb wear ye out! Yuh wanta think twicet
 'fore ye come ridin' up where I kin hear yuh call Luck Lindsay a thief,
 now I'm tellin' ye! If a bank was robbed, ye better be gittin' out after
 them that done it, and git outa the way uh that camery sos't we can git t'
 work! Git!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff did not "git" exactly, but he did look considerably
 embarrassed. His eyes went to Luck apologetically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cashier come to and said you'd called him up on the phone about eleven,
 claimin' you wanted to make a movin' pitcher of the bank being robbed," he
 explained?though he was careful not to lower his gun. "He swore it
 was your men that done the work and took the gold you told him to pile out
 on the?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>I</i> told him?" Luck's voice had the sharpened quality that caused
 laggard actors to jump. "Be a little more exact in the words you use."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well-l?somebody on the phone 't he THOUGHT was you," the sheriff
 amended obediently. "Your men?and they sure WAS your men, because
 three or four fellers besides the cashier seen 'em goin' in and comin' out?they
 gagged the cashier and took his keys away from him and cleaned the safe,
 besides taking what gold he'd piled on the counter for y?for 'em.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So," he finished vigorously, "I an' my men hit the trail fer the ranch
 and was told by the women that you was out here. And here we are, and you
 might just as well come along peaceable as to make a fuss?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That thar is shore enough outa YOU, Hank Miller!" Applehead exploded
 again. "I calc'late you kin count ME in, when you go mixin' up with Luck,
 here. I'm one of his men?and if he was to pull off a bank robbery I
 calc'late I'd be in on that there performance too, I'm tellin' you! Luck
 don't go no whars ner do nothin' that I AIN'T in on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've had some considerable experience as shurf myself, if you'll take the
 trouble to recolleck; and I calc'late my word'll go about as fur as the
 next. When I tell ye thar ain't goin' to be no arrest made in Bear Canon,
 and that you ain't goin' to take luck in fer no bank robbery, you kin be
 dang shore I mean every word uh that thar!" He moved a step or two nearer
 the sheriff, and the sheriff backed his horse away from him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ef you kin cut out this here accusin' Luck, and talk like a white man,"
 Applehead continued heatedly, "we'd like to hear the straight uh this here
 robbery. I would, 'n' I know Luck would, seein' they've gone t' work and
 mixed him into it. His bunch is all here, as you kin see fer yourself. Now
 we're listenin' 's long's you talk polite?'n' you kin tell us what
 men them was that was seen goin' in and comin' out?and all about the
 hull dang business."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff had not ridden to Bear Canon expecting to be bullied into
 civil speech and lengthy explanations; but he knew Applehead Furrman, and
 he had sufficient intelligence to read correctly the character of the
 group of men that stood behind Applehead. Honest men or thieves, they were
 to, be reckoned with if any attempt were made to place Luck under arrest;
 any fool could see that?and Hank Miller was not a fool.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He proceeded therefore to explain his errand and the robbery as the
 cashier had described it to the clerks who returned after lunch to finish
 their Saturday's work at the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fifteen thousand they claim is what the fellers got. And one of your men
 that runs the camera was keeping up a bluff of taking a pitcher of it all
 the time?that's why they got away with it. Nobody suspicioned it was
 anything more'n moving-pitcher acting till they found the cashier and
 brought him toy along about one o'clock. It was that Chavez feller that
 you had working for yuh, and Luis Rojas that done it?them and a
 couple fellers stalling outside with the camera."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder," hazarded Pete Lowry, who had come down and joined the group,
 "if that wasn't Bill Holmes with the camera? He was a lot more friendly
 with Ramon than he tried to let on."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The point is," Luck broke in, "that they took advantage of my holdup
 scene to pull off the robbery. I can see how the cashier would fall for a
 retake like that, especially since he don't know much about
 picture-making. Gather up the props, boys, and let's go home. I'm going to
 get the rights of this thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've got it now," the sheriff informed him huffily. "Think I been
 loading you up with hot air? I was sent out to round you up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forget all that!" snapped luck. "I don't know as I enjoy having you
 fellows jump at the notion I'm a bank-robber?or that if I had robbed
 a bank I would have come right back here and gone to work. What kind of a
 simp do you think I am, for gosh sake? Can you see where anyone but a
 lunatic would go like that in broad daylight and pull off a robbery as raw
 as that one must have been, and not even make an attempt at a gateway?
 I'll gamble Applehead, here, wouldn't have fallen for a play as coarse as
 that was if he was sheriff yet. He'd have seen right away that the camera
 part was just the coarsest kind of a blind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My Lord! Think of grown men?officers of the law at that?being
 simple-minded enough to come fogging out here to me, instead of getting on
 the trail of the men that were seen on the spot! You say they came in a
 machine to the bank and you never so much as tried to trace it, or to get
 the license number even, I'll bet a month's salary you didn't! It was a
 moving-picture stall, and so you come blundering out here to the only
 picture company in the country, thinking, by gravy, that it was all
 straight goods?oh, can you beat that for a boob?" He shook back his
 heavy mane of gray hair and turned to his boys disgustedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pete and Tommy, you can drive the wagon back all right, can't you? We'll
 go on ahead and see what there is at the bottom of this yarn."

 <h2>
 CHAPTER X. DEPUTIES ALL
 </h2>
 <p>
 At the ranch, whither they rode in haste, Luck meant to leave his boys and
 go on with the sheriff to town. But the Happy Family flatly refused to be
 left behind. Even old Aleck Douglas?whom years and trouble had
 enfeebled until his very presence here with Jean and Lite was a
 health-seeking mission in the wonderful air of New Mexico?even old
 Aleck Douglas stamped his foot at Jean and declared that he was going,
 along to see that "the boy" got a square deal. There wouldn't be any
 railroading Luck to the pew for something he didn't do, he asserted with a
 tragic meaning that wrung the heart of Jean. It took Lite's arguments and
 Luck's optimism and, finally, the assurance of the sheriff that Luck was
 not under arrest and was in no danger of it, to keep the old man at the
 ranch. Also, they promised to return with all speed and not to keep supper
 waiting, before the two women were satisfied to let them go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Luck Lindsay," Rosemary bethought her to announce just as they were
 leaving, "you better keep an eye out for Annie, while you're in town.
 She's gone?and the dog and all her clothes and everything. Maybe she
 took the train back to the reservation. I just wanted you to know, so if
 you feel you ought to bother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie gone?" Even in his preoccupation the mews came with a stab. "When
 did she go?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We don't know. She set up an awful yowling when you boys went to work.
 And the dog commenced howling, till it was simply awful. So we rode in to
 town after the mail, and when we came back she was gone, bag and baggage.
 We didn't see anything of her on the trail, but she could dodge us if she
 wanted to?she's Injun enough for that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Luck carried a double load of anxiety with him to town, and the first
 thing he did when he reached it was to seek, not the beaten cashier who
 had accused him, but the ticket agent at the depot, and the baggage men?anyone
 who would be apt to remember Annie-Many-Ponies if she took a train out of
 town.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 You might think that, with so many Indians coming and going at the depot,
 selling their wares and making picturesque setting for the curios which
 are purveyed there, that Luck stood a very slight chance of gaining any
 information whatever. But a Sioux squaw in Albuquerque would be as
 noticeable as a Hindoo. Pueblos, Navajos?they may come and go
 unnoticed because of their numbers. But an Indian of another tribe and
 style of dress would be conspicuous enough to be remembered. So, when no
 one remembered seeing Annie-Many-Ponies, Luck dismissed the conjecture
 that she had taken the train, and turned his attention to picking up the
 trail of the bank-robbers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here the Happy Family, with Applehead and Lite Avery, had managed to
 accomplish a good deal in a very short time. The Native Son, for instance,
 had ridden straight out from the bank into the Mexican quarter, as soon as
 he learned that the red automobile had gone up Silver Street and turned
 south on Fourth. By the time Luck reached the bank Miguel came loping back
 with the news that the red machine had crossed the lower bridge and had
 turned up toward Atrisco, that little Mexican hamlet which lies between
 the river and the bluffs where the white sand of the desert spills over
 into the nearest corrals and little pastures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others had learned definitely that Bill Holmes had manipulated the
 fake camera while the bank was being robbed, and that the man with him,
 who bad also driven the machine, was a certain chauffeur of colorless
 personality and an unsavory reputation among other drivers; and that the
 number of the automobile was a matter of conjecture, since three different
 men who were positive they remembered it gave three different numbers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In company with the sheriff they called upon the cashier, who was in bed
 with his head bandaged and his nerves very much unstrung. He was much
 calmer, however, than when he had hysterically accused Luck of betraying
 him into putting the money out to be stolen. He admitted now that he was
 not at all sure of the voice which talked with him over the phone; indeed,
 now when he heard luck speak, he felt extremely doubtful of the similarity
 of that other voice. He protested against being blamed for being too
 confiding. He had never dreamed, he said, that anyone could be so bold as
 to plan a thing like that. It all sounded straight, about the spoiled
 negative and so forth. He was very sorry that he had caused Luck Lindsay
 any inconvenience or annoyance, and he begged Luck's pardon several times
 in the course of his explanation of the details.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They left him still protesting and apologizing and explaining and touching
 his bandaged head with self-pitying tenderness. In the street Luck turned
 to the sheriff as though his mind was made up to something which argument
 could not alter in the slightest degree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I realize that in a way I'm partly responsible for this," he said
 crisply. "The scenes I took the other day made this play possible for
 Ramon and his bunch. What you'd better do right now is to swear Applehead
 and me in as deputies?and any of the boys that want to come along
 and help round up that bunch. We'll do it, if it's to be done at all. I
 feel I kind of owe it to that poor simp in there to get the money back?sabe?
 And I owe it to myself to bring in Ramon and Bill Holmes, and whoever else
 is with 'em on this; young Rojas we know is for one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where do you aim to look for 'em, if you don't mind telling?" Hank Miller
 was staring doubtfully down at Luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where? Miguel here says they went toward Atrisco. That means they're
 hitting for the Navajo reservation. There's three hundred miles of country
 straight west, and not so much as a telegraph pole! Mighty few service
 stations for the machine, too, when you think of it?and rough
 country to travel over. If they try to go by automobile, we'll overhaul
 them, most likely, before they get far. Also, we can trace 'em easy
 enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The sheriff pulled at his stubby mustache and looked the bunch over. "You
 know that country?" he asked, still doubtfully. "Them Navvies are plumb
 snaky, lemme tell yuh. Ain't like the Pueblos?you're taking a risk
 when yuh ride into the Navvy country. They'll get yuh if they get a
 chancet; run off your horses, head yuh away from water?they're plumb
 MEAN!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I calc'late I know them Navvies putty tol'ble well," Applehead
 cut in. "I've fit 'em comin' and goin'. Why, my shucks! Ef I notched my
 gun for the Navvies I've got off an' on in the course uh my travels, she'd
 shore look like a saw-blade, now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, an' yuh got a couple too many fer to go monkeyin' around on their
 groun' agin," the sheriff informed him bluntly. "They ain't forgot the
 trip you made over there after Jose Martinez. Best fer you to keep off'n
 that reservation, Applehead?and I'm speakin' as a friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As a friend you kin shet up," Applehead retorted pettishly. "Ef Luck hits
 fer the Navvy country after them skunks, I calc'late ole Applehead'll be
 somers close handy by?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurry up and swear us in," Luck interrupted. "We've got to get to the
 ranch and back with an outfit, yet tonight, so we can hit the trail as
 soon as possible. No use for you to take the oath, Andy?what you
 better do is to stay at the ranch with the women folks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aleck will be there, and Pete and Tommy and the cook," Andy rebelled
 instantly. His hand went up to take the oath with the others.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There on the corner of the street where the shadows lay under a gently
 whispering box-elder tree, Hank Miller faced the group that stood with
 right hands uplifted and swore them as he had sworn?with the oath
 that made deputy sheriffs of them all. He told them that while he did not
 believe the thieves had gone to the reservation, and would look for them
 elsewhere, the idea was worth acting upon?seeing they wanted to do
 it anyway; and that the sheriff's office stood ready to assist them in any
 way possible. He wished them luck and hurried away, evidently much
 relieved to get away and out of an uncomfortable position.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the next two hours Luck managed to accomplish a good deal, which was
 one of the reasons why he was manager and director of the Flying U Feature
 Films. Just for example, he went to a friend who was also something of a
 detective, and put him on the job of find Annie-Many-Ponies?a bigger
 task than it looked to Luck, as we have occasion to know. He sent some of
 the boys back to the ranch in a machine, and told them just what to bring
 back with them in the way of rifles, bedding rolls, extra horses and so
 on. The horses they had ridden into town he had housed in a livery stable.
 He took the Native Son and a Mexican driver and went over to Atrisco,
 routed perfectly polite and terribly sleepy individuals out of their beds
 and learned beyond all question that a red automobile with several men in
 it had passed through the dusty lanes and had labored up the hill to the
 desert mesa beyond and that no one had seen it return.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He sent a hundred-and-fifty-word message to Dewitt of the Great Western
 Company in Los Angeles, explaining with perfect frankness the situation
 and his determination to get out after the robbers, and made it plain also
 that he would not expect salary for the time he spent in the chase. He
 ended by saying tersely, "My reputation and standing of company here at
 stake," and signed his name in a hasty scrawl that made the operator
 scratch his ear reflectively with his pencil when he had counted the words
 down to the signature. After that, Luck gave every ounce of his energy and
 every bit of his brain to the outfitting of the expedition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So well did he accomplish the task that by one O'clock that night a
 low-voiced company of men rode away from a livery stable in the heart of
 the town, leading four pack-horses and heading as straight as might be for
 the bridge. They met no one; they saw scarcely a light in any of the
 windows that they passed. A chill wind crept up the river so that they
 buttoned their coats when the hoofbeats of the horses sounded hollow on
 the bridge. Out through the lane that leads to Atrisco, which slept in the
 stolid blackness of low adobe houses with flat roofs and tiny windows,
 they rode at a trot. Dogs barked, ran but to the road and barked again,
 ran back to the adobe huts and kept on barking. In one field some loose
 horses, seeing so many of their kind in the lane, galloped up to the fence
 and stood there snorting. These were still in their colthood, however, and
 the saddle-horses merely flicked ears in their direction and gave them no
 more heed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm glad you're sure of the country, up here on top," Luck said to
 Applehead when they had climbed, by the twisting, sandy trail, to the sand
 dunes that lay on the edge of the mesa and stretched vaguely away under
 the stars. To the rim-rook line that separated this first mesa from the
 higher one beyond, Luck himself knew the sand-hills well. But beyond the
 broken line of hills off to the northwest he had never gone?and
 there lay the territory that belongs to the Navajos, who are a tricky
 tribe and do not love the white people who buy their rugs and blankets
 and, so claim the Navajos, steal their cattle and their horses as well.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the rim of lava rock they made a dry camp and lay down in what comfort
 they could achieve, to doze and wait for daylight so that they could pick
 up the trail of the red automobile.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XI. ALL THIS WAR-TALK ABOUT INJUNS
 </h2>
 <p>
 Over his second cup of coffee the pale eyes of Big Medicine goggled
 thoughtfully at the forbidding wall of lava rock that stretched before
 them as far as he could see to left or right. There were places here and
 there where he believed that a man could climb to the top with the aid of
 his hands as well as his feet, but for the horses he was extremely
 skeptical; and as for a certain big red automobile.... His eyes swung from
 the brown rampart and rested grievedly upon the impassive face of Luck,
 who was just then reaching forward to spear another slice of bacon from
 the frying pan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kinda looks to me, by cripes, as if we'd come to the end uh the trail,"
 he observed in his usual full-lunged bellow, as though he had all his life
 been accustomed to pitching his voice above some unending clamor. "Yuh got
 any idee of how an autyMObile clumb that there rim-rock?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Old Applehead, squatting on his heels across the little camp-fire, leaned
 and picked a coal out of the ashes for his pipe and afterwards cocked his
 eyes toward Big Medicine.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What yuh calc'late yuh tryin' to do?" he inquired pettishly. "Start up an
 argyment uh some kind? Cause if ye air, lemme tell yuh I got the yer-ache
 from listenin' to you las' night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Big Medicine looked at him as though he was going to spring upon him in
 deadly combat?but that was only a peculiar facial trick of his. What
 he did do was to pour that last swallow of hot, black coffee down his
 throat and then laugh his big haw-haw-haw that could be heard half a mile
 off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Y' oughta kep Applehead to home with the wimmin folks, Luck," he bawled
 unabashed. "Night air's bad fer 'im, and the trail ain't goin' to be
 smooth goin',?not if we gotta ride our hawses straight up, by
 cripes!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We haven't got to." Luck balanced his slice of bacon upon the unscorched
 side of a bannock and glanced indifferently at the rim of rock that was
 worrying the other. "I swung down here to make camp off the trail But it's
 only a half mile or so over this rise that looks level to you, to where
 the lava ledge peters out so we can ride over it easier than we rode up
 off the river-flat in that loose sand. That ease your mind any?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helps some," Big Medicine admitted, his eyes going speculatively to the
 rise that looked perfectly level. "I'm willin' to take your word fer it,
 boss. But what's gittin' to worry me, by cripes, is all this here war-talk
 about Injuns. Honest to grandma, I feel like as if I'd been readin'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, it's jest a josh, Bud!" Happy Jack asserted boredly. "I betche there
 ain't been a Injun on the fight here sence hell was a tradin' post!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You think there hasn't?" Luck looked up quickly to ask. But old Applehead
 rose up and shook an indignant finger at Happy Jack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There ain't, hey? Well, I calc'late that fer a josh, them thar Navvies
 has got a right keen sense uh humor, and I've knowed men to laff
 theirselves to death on their danged resavation?now I'm tellin' yuh
 I It was all a josh mebby, when they riz up a year or two back 'cause one
 uh their tribe was goin' t' be arrested er some darn thing! Ole General
 Scott, he didn't call it no joke when he, went in thar to settle 'em down,
 did he? I calc'late, mebby it was jest fer a josh them troops waited on
 the aidge, ready to go in if he didn't git back a certain time! 'N' that
 wasn't so fur back, shorely,?only two years. Why dang your fool
 heart, I've laid out there in them hills myself and fit off the Navvies?'n'
 <i>I</i> didn't see nothin' much to laugh at, now I'm tellin' yuh! Time I
 went there after Jose Martinez?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Better get under way, boys," Luck interrupted, having heard many times
 the details of that fight and capture. "We'll throw out a circle and pick
 up the trail of that machine, or whatever they made their getaway in. My
 idea is that they must have stached some horses out here somewhere. I
 don't believe they'd take the risk of trying to get away in a machine;
 that would hold them to the main trails, mostly. I know it wouldn't be my
 way of getting outa reach. I'd want horses so I could get into rough
 country, and I've doped it out that Ramon is too trail-wise to bank very
 high on an automobile once he got out away from town. Applehead, you and
 Lite and Pink and Weary form one party if it comes to where we want to
 divide forces. Pack a complete camp outfit on the sorrel and the black?you
 notice that's the way I had 'em packed first. Keep their packs just as we
 started out, then you'll be ready to strike out by yourselves whenever it
 seems best. Get me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We get you, boss," Weary sang out cheerfully, and went to work gathering
 up the breakfast things and putting them into two little piles for the
 packs. Pink led up the black and the sorrel, and helped to pack them with
 bedding and supplies for four, as Luck had ordered, while Lite and
 Applehead saddled their horses and then came up to help throw the diamond
 hitches on the packs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A couple of rods nearer the rock wall Happy Jack was grumbling, across the
 canvas pack of a little bay, at Big Medicine, who was warning him against
 leaving his hair so long as a direct temptation to scalp-lifting. Luck bad
 already mounted and ridden out a little way, where he could view the
 country behind them with his field glasses, to make sure that in the
 darkness they had not passed by anything that deserved a closer
 inspection. He came back at a lope and motioned to Andy and the Native
 Son.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That red automobile is standing back about half a mile," he announced
 hurriedly. "Empty and deserted, looks like. We'll go back and take a look
 at it. The rest of you can finish packing and wait here till we come back.
 No use making extra travel for your horses. They'll get all they need, the
 chances are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The red automobile was empty of everything but the upholstering and a jack
 in the toolbox. The state license number was gone, and the serial number
 on the engine had been hammered into illegibility. What tracks there were
 had been blown nearly full of the white sand of that particular locality
 There was nothing to be learned there, except the very patent fact that
 the machine bad been abandoned for some reason. Luck took a look at the
 engine and saw nothing wrong with it. There was oil and there was "gas"?a
 whole tank full. Andy and Miguel, riding an ever-widening circle around
 the machine while Luck was looking for evidence of a breakdown, ran across
 a lot of hoofprints that seemed to head straight away past the rim-rock
 and on to the hills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They picked up the trail of the hoofprints and followed it. When they
 returned to the others they found the boys all mounted and waiting
 impatiently like hounds on the leash eager to get away on the chase. Six
 horses there were, and even old Applehead, who was in a bad humor that
 morning and seemed to hate agreeing with anyone, admitted that probably
 the four who had committed the robbery and left town in the machine had
 been met out here by a man who brought horses for them and one extra pack
 horse. This explained the number in the most plausible manner, and
 satisfied everyone that they were on the right trail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Riding together?since they were on a plain trail and there was
 nothing to be gained by separating?they climbed to the higher mesa,
 crossed the ridge of the three barren hills that none of them but
 Applehead had ever passed, and went on and on and on as the hoofprints led
 them, straight toward the reservation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They discussed the robbery from every angle?they could think of, and
 once or twice someone hazarded a guess at Annie-Many-Ponies' reason for
 leaving and her probable destination. They wondered how old Dave Wiswell,
 the dried little cattleman of The Phantom Herd, was making out in Denver,
 where he had gone to consult a specialist about some kidney trouble that
 had interfered with his riding all spring. Weary suggested that maybe
 Annie-Many-Ponies had taken a notion to go and visit old Dave, since the
 two were old friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was here that Applehead unwittingly put into words the vague suspicion
 which Luck had been trying to stifle and had not yet faced as a definite
 idea.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I calc'late we'll likely find that thar squaw putty tol'ble close to whar
 we find Bill Holmes," Applehead remarked sourly. "Her goin' off same, day
 they stuck up that bank don't look to me like no happenstance?now
 I'm tellin' yuh! 'N' if I was shurf, and was ast to locate that squaw, I'd
 keep right on the trail uh Bill Holmes, jest as we're doin' now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That isn't like Annie," Luck said sharply to, still the conviction in his
 own mind. "Whatever faults she may have, she's been loyal to me, and
 honest. Look how she stuck last winter, when she didn't have anything at
 stake, wasn't getting any salary, and yet worked like a dog to help make
 the picture a success. Look how she got up in the night when the blizzard
 struck, and fed our horses and cooked breakfast of her own accord, just so
 I could get out early and get my scenes. I've known her since she was a
 dirty-faced papoose, and I never knew her to lie or steal. She wasn't in
 on that robbery?I'll bank on that, and she wouldn't go off with a
 thief. It isn't like Annie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," said Big Medicine, thinking of his own past, "the best uh women
 goes wrong when some knot-headed man gits to lovemakin'. They'll do things
 fer the wrong kinda man, by cripes, that they wouldn't do fer no other
 human on earth. I've knowed a good woman to lie and steal?fer a man
 that wasn't fit, by cripes, to tip his hat to 'er in the street! Women,"
 he added pessimistically, "is something yuh can't bank on, as safe as yuh
 can on a locoed horse!" He kicked his mount unnecessarily by way of easing
 the resentment which one woman had managed to instil against the sex in
 general.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's where you're darned right, Bud," Pink attested with a sudden
 bitterness which memory brought. "I wouldn't trust the best woman that
 ever lived outa my sight, when you come right down to cases."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, here!" Andy Green, thinking loyally of his Rosemary, swung his horse
 indignantly toward the two. "Cut that out, both of you! Just because you
 two got stung, is no reason why you've got to run down all the rest of the
 women. I happen to know one?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, nobody was talking about Rosemary," Big Medicine apologized gruffly.
 "She's different; any fool knows that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've got a six-gun here that'll talk for another one," silent Lite
 Avery spoke up suddenly. "One that would tip the scales on the woman's
 side for goodness if the rest of the whole sex was bad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, thunder!" Pink cried, somewhat redder than the climbing sun alone
 would warrant. "I'll take it back. I didn't mean THEM?you know
 darned well I didn't mean them?nor lots of other women I know. What
 I meant was?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What you meant was Annie," Luck broke in uncompromisingly. "And I'm not
 condemning her just because things look black. You don't know Indians the
 way I know them. There's some things an Indian will do, and then again
 there's some things they won't do. You boys don't know it?but
 yesterday morning when we left the ranch, Annie-Many-Ponies made me the
 peace-sign. And after that she went into her tent and began to sing the
 Omaha. It didn't mean anything to you?Old Dave is the only one that
 would have sabed, and he wasn't there. But it meant enough to me that I
 came pretty near riding back to have a pow-wow with Annie, even if we were
 late. I wish I had. I'd have less on my conscience right now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fur's I kin see," Applehead dissented impatiently, "you ain't got no call
 to have nothin' on your conscience where that thar squaw is concerned. You
 treated her a hull lot whiter'n what she deserved?now I'm tellin'
 ye! 'N' her traipsin' around at nights 'n'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you, you don't know Indians!" Luck swung round in the saddle so
 that he could face Applehead. "You don't know the Sioux, anyway. She
 wouldn't have made me that peace-sign if she'd been double-crossing me, I
 tell you. And she wouldn't have sung the Omaha if she was going to throw
 in with a thief that was trying to lay me wide open to suspicion. I've
 been studying things over in my mind, and there's something in this affair
 I can't sabe. And until you've got some proof, the less you say about
 Annie-Many-Ponies the better I'll be pleased."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That, coming from Luck in just that tone and with just that look in his
 eyes, was tantamount to an ultimatum, and it was received as one. Old
 Applehead grunted and chewed upon a wisp of his sunburned mustache that
 looked like dried cornsilk after a frost. The Happy Family exchanged
 careful glances and rode meekly along in silence. There was not a man of
 them but believed that Applehead was nearer right than Luck, but they were
 not so foolish as to express that belief.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a while Big Medicine began bellowing tunelessly that old ditty, once
 popular but now half forgotten:
 </p><br>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> "Nava, Nava, My Navaho-o
 I have a love for you that will grow-ow!"
</pre>
 <p>
 Which stirred old Applehead to an irritated monologue upon the theme of
 certain persons whose ignorance is not blissful, but trouble-inviting.
 Applehead, it would seem from his speech upon the subject, would be a much
 surprised ex-sheriff?now a deputy?if they were not all
 captured and scalped, if not worse, the minute their feet touched the
 forbidden soil of these demons in human form, the Navajo Indians.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If they were not too busy weaving blankets for Fred Harvey," Luck
 qualified with his soft Texan drawl and the smile that went with it. "You
 talk as if these boys were tourists."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," added Andy Green maliciously, "here comes a war-party now, boys.
 Duck behind a rock, Applehead, they're liable to charge yuh fer them
 blankets!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Happy Family laughed uproariously, to the evident bewilderment of the
 two Indians who, swathed in blankets and with their hair knotted and tied
 with a green ribbon and a yellow, drove leisurely toward the group in an
 old wagon that had a bright new seat and was drawn by a weazened span of
 mangy-looking bay ponies. In the back of the wagon sat a young squaw and
 two papooses, and beside them were stacked three or four of the gay,
 handwoven rugs for which the white people will pay many dollars.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buenas dias," said the driver of the wagon, who was an oldish Indian with
 a true picture-postal face. And: "Hello," said the other, who was young
 and wore a bright blue coat, such as young Mexicans affect.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, folks," cried the Happy Family genially, and lifted their hats to
 the good-looking young squaw in the wagon-bed, who tittered in bashful
 appreciation of the attention.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mama! They sure are wild and warlike," Weary commented drily as he turned
 to stare after the wagon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Us little deputies had better run home," Pink added with mock alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "By cripes, I know now what went with Applehead's hair!" bawled Big
 Medicine. "Chances is, it's weaved into that red blanket the old buck is
 wearin'?Haw-haw-haw!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laff, dang ye, laff!" Applehead cried furiously. "But do your laffing
 where I can't hear ye, fer I'm tellin' ye right now I've had enough of
 yore dang foolishness. And the next feller that makes a crack is goin' to
 wisht he hadn't now I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was not so much an ultimatum as a declaration of war?and the
 Happy Family suddenly found themselves all out of the notion of laughing
 at anything at all.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XII. THE WILD-GOOSE CHASE
 </h2>
 <p>
 Because they had no human means of knowing anything about the black
 automobile that bad whirled across the mesa to the southeast and left its
 mysterious passengers in one of the arroyos that leads into the Sandias
 Mountains near Coyote Springs, nine cowpuncher deputy-sheriffs bored their
 way steadily through sun and wind and thirst, traveling due northwest,
 keeping always on the trail of the six horses that traveled steadily
 before them Always a day's march behind, always watching hopefully for
 some sign of delay?for an encouraging freshness in the tracks that
 would show a lessening distance between the two parties, Luck and his
 Happy Family rode?from dawn till dusk, from another dawn to another
 dusk. Their horses, full of little exuberant outbursts of
 horse-foolishness when they had left town, settled clown to a dogged,
 plodding half walk, half trot which is variously described upon the range;
 Luck, for instance, calling it poco-poco; while the Happy Family termed it
 running-walk, trail-trot, fox-trot?whatever came easiest to their
 tongues at the time. Call it what they pleased, the horses came to a point
 where they took the gait mechanically whenever the country was decently
 level. They forgot to shy at strange objects, and they never danced away
 from a foot lifted to the stirrup when the sky was flaunting gorgeous
 bantiers to herald the coming of the sun. More than once they were
 thankful to have the dust washed from their nostrils and to let that pass
 for a drink. For water holes were few and far between when they struck
 that wide, barren land ridged here and there with hills of rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Twice the trail of the six horses was lost, because herds of cattle had
 passed between those who rode in baste before, and those who followed in
 haste a day's ride behind. They saw riders in the distance nearly every
 day, but only occasionally did any Indians come within speaking distance.
 These were mostly headed townward in wagons and rickety old buggies, with
 the men riding dignifiedly on the spring seat and the squaws and papooses
 sitting flat in the bottom behind. These family parties became more and
 more inclined to turn and stare after the Happy Family, as if they were
 puzzling over the errand that would take nine men riding close-grouped
 across the desert, with four pack-horses to proclaim the journey a long
 one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the trail swung sharply away from the dim wagon road and into the
 northwest where the land lay parched and pitiless under the hot sun, the
 Happy Family hitched their gun-belts into place, saw to it that their
 canteens were brimming with the water that was so precious, and turned
 doggedly that way, following the lead of Applehead, who knew the country
 fairly well, and of Luck, who did not know the country, but who knew that
 he meant to overhaul Ramon Chavez and Bill Holmes, go where they would,
 and take them back to jail. If they could ride across this barren stretch,
 said Luck to Applehead, he and his bunch could certainly follow them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, this is kinda takin' chances," Applehead observed soberly, "unless
 Ramon, he knows whar's the water-holes. If he does hit water regular, I
 calc'late we kin purty nigh foller his lead. They's things I don't like
 about the way this here trail is leading out this way, now I'm tellin'
 yuh! Way we're goin', we'll be in the Seven Lakes country 'fore we know
 it. Looks to me like them greasers must stand in purty well with the
 Navvies?'n' if they do, it'll be dang hard pullin' to git 'em away
 'n! outa here. 'N' if they don't stand in, they'd oughta bore more west
 than what they're doin'. Looks dang queer to me, now I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, all I want is to overtake them. We'll do it, too. The little grain
 these horses get is showing its worth right now," Luck cheered him.
 "They're keeping up better than I was afraid they would. We've got that
 advantage?a Mexican don't as a rule grain his horses, and the
 chances are that Ramon thought more about the gold than he did about
 carrying horse-feed. We can hold on longer than he can, Applehead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We can't either," Applehead disputed, "because if Ramon takes a notion
 he'll steal fresh horses from the Injuns."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought you said he stood in with the Injuns," Weary spoke up from the
 ambling group, behind. "You're kinda talkin' in circles, ain't you,
 Applehead?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I calc'late yuh jest about got to talk in circles to git anywheres
 near Ramon," Applehead retorted, looking back at the others. "They's so,
 dang many things he MIGHT be aimin' to do, that I ain't been right easy in
 my mind the last day or two, and I'm tellin' ye so. 'S like a storm?I
 kin smell trouble two days off; that's mebby why I'm still alive an' able
 to fork a boss. An' I'm tellin' you right now, I kin smell trouble
 stronger'n a polecat under the chicken-house!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, by cripes, let 'er come!" Big Medicine roared cheerfully,
 inspecting a battered plug of "chewin'" to see where was the most inviting
 corner in which to set his teeth. "Me'n' trouble has locked horns more'n
 once, 'n' I'd feel right lonesome if I thought our trails'd never cross
 agin. Why, down in Coconino County?" He went off into a long recital
 of certain extremely bloody chapters in the history of that famed county
 as chronicled by one Bud Welch, otherwise known as Big Medicine?and
 not because of his modesty, you may be sure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Noon of that day found them plodding across a high, barren mesa under a
 burning sun. Since red dawn they had been riding, and the horses showed
 their need of water. They lagged often into a heavy-footed walk and their
 ears drooped dispiritedly. Even Big Medicine found nothing cheerful to
 say. Luck went out of his way to gain the top of every little rise, and to
 scan the surrounding country through his field glasses. The last time he
 came sliding down to the others his face was not so heavy with anxiety and
 his voice when he spoke had a new briskness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's a ranch of some kind straight ahead about two miles," he
 announced. "I could see a green patch, so there must be water around there
 somewhere. We'll make noon camp there, and maybe we can dig up a little
 information. Ramon must have stopped there for water, and we'll find out
 just how far we are behind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ranch, when they finally neared it, proved to be a huddle of low,
 octagon-shaped huts (called hogans) made of short cedar logs and plastered
 over with adobe, with a hole in the center of the lid-like roof to let the
 smoke out and a little light in; and dogs, that ran out and barked and
 yelped and trailed into mourning rumbles and then barked again; and
 half-naked papooses that scurried like rabbits for shelter when they rode
 up; and two dingy, shapeless squaws that disappeared within a hogan and
 peered out at one side of the blanket door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck started to dismount and make some attempt at a polite request for
 water, and for information as well, but Applehead objected and finally had
 his way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If the squaws could speak English, he argued, they would lie unless they
 refused to talk at all. As to the water, if there was any around the place
 the bunch could find it and help themselves. "These yer Navvies ain't yore
 Buffalo-Bill Sioux," he pointed out to Luck. "Yuh can't treat 'em the
 same. The best we kin look fer is to be left alone?an' I'm tellin'
 ye straight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck gave the squalid huts a long stare and turned away toward the corral
 and a low shed that served as a stable. A rusty old mower and a toothless
 rake and a rickety buckboard stood baking in the sun, and a few stunted
 hens fluttered away from their approach. In the corral a mangy pony
 blinked in dejected slumber; and all the while, the three dogs followed
 them and barked and yapped and growled, until Pink turned in the saddle
 with the plain intention of stopping the clamor with a bullet or two.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ye better let 'em alone!" Applehead warned sharply, and Pink put up his
 gun unfired and took down his rope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The darned things are getting on my nerves!" he complained, and wheeled
 suddenly in pursuit of the meanest-looking dog of the three. "I can stand
 a decent dog barking at me, but so help me Josephine, I draw the line at
 Injun curs!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The dog ran yelping toward the hogans with Pink hard at its heels swinging
 his loop menacingly. When the dog, with a last hysterical yelp, suddenly
 flattened its body and wriggled under a corner of the shed, Pink turned
 and rode after the others, who had passed the corral and were heading for
 the upper and of a small patch of green stuff that looked like a
 half-hearted attempt at a vegetable garden. As he passed the shed an
 Indian in dirty overalls and gingham shirt craned his neck around the
 doorway and watched him malevolently; but Pink, sighting the green patch
 and remembering their dire need of water, was kicking his horse into a
 trot and never once thought to cast an eye over his shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In that arid land, where was green vegetation you may be sure there was
 water also. And presently the nine were distributed along a rod or two of
 irrigating ditch, thankfully watching the swallows of water go sliding
 hurriedly down the outstretched gullets of their horses that leaned
 forward with half-bent, trembling knees, fetlock deep in the wet sand of
 the ditch-banks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drink, you sons-uh-guns, drink!" Weary exclaimed jubilantly, "you've sure
 got it coming?and mama, how I do hate to see a good horse suffering
 for a feed or water, or shelter from a storm!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They pulled them away before they were satisfied, and led them back to
 where green grass was growing. There they pulled the saddles off and let
 the poor brutes feed while they unpacked food for themselves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll pay in the long run," said Luck, "to give them an hour here. I'll
 pay the Injuns for what grass they eat. Ramon must have stopped here
 yesterday. I'm going up and see if I can't pry a little information loose
 from those squaws and papooses. Come on, Applehead?you can talk a
 little Navvy; you come and tell 'em what I want."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead hesitated, and with a very good reason. He might, for all he
 knew, be trespassing upon the allotment of a friend or relative of some of
 the Indians he had been compelled to "get" in the course of his duties as
 sheriff. And at any rate they all knew him?or at least knew of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, gwan, Applehead," Happy Jack urged facetiously, sure that Applehead
 had tried to scare him with tales of Indians whose pastoral pursuits
 proclaimed aloud their purity of souls. "Gwan! You ain't afraid of a
 couple of squaws, are yuh? Go on and talk to the ladies. Mebby yuh might
 win a wife if yuh just had a little nerve!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead turned and glowered. But Luck was already walking slowly toward
 the hogans and looking back frequently, so Applehead contented himself by
 saying, "You wait till this yere trip's over, 'fore ye git so dang funny
 in yore remarks, young man!" and stalked after Luck, hitching his
 six-shooter forward as he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the shed, the Indian who had peered after Pink stood in the doorway and
 stared unwinkingly as they came up. Applehead glanced at him sharply from
 under his sorrel eyebrows and grunted. He knew him by sight well enough,
 and he took it for granted that the recognition was mutual. But he gave no
 sign of remembrance. Instead, he asked how much the Indian wanted for the
 grass the horses would eat in an hour.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian looked at the two impassively and did not say anything at all;
 so Applehead flipped him a dollar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, what time did them fellows pass here yesterday?" Applehead asked, in
 the half Indian, half Mexican jargon which nearly all New Mexico Indians
 speak.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian looked at the dollar and moved his head of bobbed hair vaguely
 from left to right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, dang ye, don't talk if ye don't feel like it," Applehead
 commented in wasted sarcasm, and looked at Luck for some hint of what was
 wanted next. Luck seemed uncertain, so Applehead turned toward the ditch,
 and the food his empty stomach craved.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No use tryin' to make 'em talk if they ain't in the notion," he told Luck
 impatiently. "He's got his dollar, and we'll take what grass our hosses
 kin pack away in their bellies. That kinda winds up the transaction, fur's
 I kin see."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wonder if another dollar?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Applehead interrupted him. "Another dollar might git him warmed up
 so's he'd shake his danged head twicet instid uh once't," he asserted
 pessimistically, "but that's all you'd git outa him. That thar buck ain't
 TALKIN' today. Yuh better come an' eat 'n' rest yer laigs. If he talked,
 he'd lie. We're a heap better off jest doin' our own trailin' same as we
 been doin. That bunch come by here; the tracks show that. If they went on,
 the tracks'll show where they headed fur. 'N' my idee is that they'll take
 their time from now on. They don't know we're trailin' 'em up. I'll bet
 they never throwed back any scout t' watch the back trail, In' they're in
 Navvy country now?whar they're purty tol'ble safe if they stand in
 with the Injuns. 'N' I'm tellin' yuh right now, Luck, I wisht I could say
 as much fer us!" Applehead lifted his hat and rubbed his palm over his
 bald pate that was covered thickly with beads of perspiration, as if his
 head were a stone jar filled with cold water. "If we have to sep'rate,
 Luck, you take a fool's advice and keep yore dang eyes open. The boys,
 they think I been stringin' 'em along. Mebby you think so too, but I kin
 tell ye right now 't we gotta keep our dang eyes in our haids!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm taking your word for it, Applehead," Luck told him, lowering his
 voice a little because they were nearing the others. "Besides, I've heard
 a lot about these tricky boys with the Dutch-cut on their hair. I'm
 keeping it all in mind don't worry. But I sure am going to overhaul Ramon,
 if we have to follow him to salt water."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I ain't never turned back on a trail yit, fer want uh nerve to
 foller it," Applehead stated offendedly. "When I was shurf?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The enlivened jumble of voices, each proclaiming the owner's hopes or
 desires or disbelief to ears that were not listening, quite submerged
 Applehead's remarks upon the subject of his wellknown prowess when he was
 "shurf." The Happy Family were sprawled in unwonted luxury on the shady
 side of an outcropping of rock from under which a little spring seeped and
 made a small oasis in the general barrenness. They had shade, they Had
 water and food, and through the thin aromatic smoke of their cigarettes
 they could watch their horses cropping avidly the green grass that meant
 so much to them. The knowledge that an hour later they would be traveling
 again in the blazing heat of midday but emphasized their present comfort.
 They were enjoying every minute to its full sixty seconds. Laughter came
 easily and the hardships of the trail were pushed into the background of
 their minds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were not particularly anxious over the success or failure of Luck's
 trip to the hogans. They were on Ramon's trail (or so they firmly
 believed) and sooner or later they would overhaul him and Bill Holmes.
 When that happened they believed that they would be fully equal to the
 occasion, and that Ramon and Bill and those who were with him would learn
 what it means to turn traitor to the hand that has fed them, and to fling
 upon that hand the mud of public suspicion. But just now they were not
 talking about these things; they were arguing very earnestly over a very
 trivial matter indeed, and they got as much satisfaction out of the
 contention as though it really amounted to something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Luck had eaten and smoked and had ground his cigarette stub under his
 heel in the moist earth beside the spring, and had looked at his watch and
 got upon his feet with a sigh to say: "Well, boys, let's go," the Happy
 Family (who by the way must now be understood as including Lite Avery)
 sighed also and pulled their reluctant feet toward them and got up also,
 with sundry hitchings-into-place as to gun-belts and sundry resettlings as
 to hats. They pulled their horses more reluctant even than their riders?away
 from the green grass; resaddled, recinched the packs on the four animals
 that carried the camp supplies, gave them a last drink at the little
 irrigating ditch and mounted and straggled out again upon the trail of the
 six whom they seemed never able to overtake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They did not know that the silent Indian with the dingy overalls and the
 bobbed hair had watched every movement they made. Through all that hour of
 rest not even a papoose had been visible around the hogans?which,
 while there was nothing warlike in their keeping under cover, was not
 exactly a friendly attitude. Applehead had kept turning his keen, bright
 blue eyes that way while he ate and afterwards smoked an after-dinner
 pipe, but when they were actually started again upon the trail he appeared
 to lay aside his misgivings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not even Applehead suspected that the Indian had led a pony carefully down
 into a draw, keeping the buildings always between himself and the party of
 white men; nor that he watched them while they spread out beyond the
 cultivated patch of irrigated ground until they picked up the trail of the
 six horses, when they closed the gaps between them and followed the trail
 straight away into the parched mesa that was lined with deep washes and
 canons and crossed with stony ridges where the heat radiated up from the
 bare rocks as from a Heating stove when the fire is blazing within. When
 they rode away together, the Indian ran back into the draw, mounted his
 pony and lashed it into a heavy, sure-footed gallop.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIII. SET AFOOT
 </h2>
 <p>
 The tracks of the six horses led down into a rock-bottomed arroyo so deep
 in most places that all view of the surrounding mesa was shut off
 completely, save where the ragged tops of a distant line of hills pushed
 up into the dazzling blue of the sky. The heat, down here among the rocks,
 was all but unbearable; and when they discovered that no tracks led out of
 the arroyo on the farther side, the Happy Family dismounted and walked to
 save their horses while they divided into two parties and hunted up and
 down the arroyo for the best trail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was just such vexatious delays as this which had kept them always a
 day's ride or more behind their quarry, and Luck's hand trembled with
 nervous irritability when he turned back and banded Applehead one of those
 small, shrill police whistles whose sound carries so far, and which are
 much used by motion-picture producers for the long-distance direction of
 scenes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I happened to have a couple in my pocket," he explained hurriedly. "You
 know the signals, don't you? One long, two short will mean you've picked
 up the trail. Three or more short, quick ones is an emergency call, for
 all hands to come running."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they's one thing you want to keep in mind, Luck," Applehead urged
 from his superior trail craft. "They might be sharp enough to ride in here
 a ways and come out the same side they rode in at. Yuh want to hunt both
 sides as yuh go up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure," said Luck, and hurried away up the arroyo with Pink, Big Medicine,
 Andy and the Native Son at his heels, leading the two pack-horses that
 belonged to their party. In the opposite direction went Applehead and the
 others, their eyes upon the ground watching for the faintest sign of
 hoofprints.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That blazing ball of torment, the sun, slid farther and farther down to
 the skyline, tempering its heat with the cool promise of dusk. Away up the
 arroyo, Luck stopped for breath after a sharp climb up through a narrow
 gash in the sheer wall of what was now a small canon, and saw that to
 search any farther in that direction would be useless. Across the arroyo?that
 had narrowed and deepened until it was a canon?Andy Green was
 mopping his face with his handkerchief and studying a bold hump of jumbled
 bowlders and ledges, evidently considering whether it was worth while
 toiling up to the top. A little below him, the Native Son was flinging
 rocks at a rattlesnake with the vicious precision of frank abhorrence.
 Down in the canon bottom Big Medicine and Pink were holding the horses on
 the shady side of the gorge, and the smoke of their cigarettes floated
 lazily upward with the jumbled monotone of their voices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Andy, glancing across at Luck, waved his hand and sat down on a rock that
 was shaded by a high bowlder; reached mechanically for his "makings" and
 with his feet far apart and his elbows on his thighs, wearily rolled a
 cigarette.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How about it, boss?" he asked, scarcely raising his voice above the
 ordinary conversational tone, though a hard fifteen-minutes' climb up and
 down separated the two; "they never came up the arroyo, if you ask ME. My
 side don't show a hoof track from where we left the boys down below."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mine either," Luck replied, by the power of suggestion seating himself
 and reaching for his own tobacco and papers. "We might as well work back
 down and connect with Applehead. Wish there was some sign of water in this
 darn gulch. By the time we get down where we started from, it'll be
 sundown." He glanced down at Bud and Pink. "Hey! You can start back any,
 time," he called. "Nothing up this way."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's the grandfather of all rattlers," Miguel called across to Luck,
 and held up by the tail a great snake that had not ceased its muscular
 writhings. "Twelve rattles and a button. Have I got time to skin him? He
 tried to bite me on the leg?but I beard him and got outa reach."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We've got to be moving," Luck answered. "It's a long ways back where we
 started from, and we've got to locate water, if we can." He rose with the
 deliberateness that indicated tired muscles, and started back; and to
 himself he muttered exasperatedly: "A good three hours all shot to pieces?and
 not a mile gained on that bunch!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Native Son, calmly pinching the rattles of the snake he had not time
 to skin, climbed down into the Canon and took his horse by the bridle
 reins. Behind him Andy Green came scrambling; but Luck, still faintly
 hoping for a clue, kept to the upper rim of the arroyo, scanning every bit
 of soft ground where it seemed possible for a horse to climb up from
 below. He had always recognized the native cunning of Ramon, but he had
 never dreamed him as cunning as this latest ruse would seem to prove him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As for Bill Holmes, Luck dismissed him with a shrug of contempt. Bill
 Holmes had been stranded in Albuquerque when the cold weather was coming
 on; he had been hungry and shelterless and ill-clad?one of those
 bits of flotsam which drift into our towns and stand dejectedly upon our
 street-corners when they do not prowl down alleys to the back doors of our
 restaurants in the hope of being permitted to wash the soiled dishes of
 more fortunate men for the food which diners have left beside their
 plates. Luck had fed Bill Holmes, and he had given him work to do and the
 best food and shelter he could afford; and for thanks, Bill had?as
 Luck believed?made sly, dishonest love to Annie-Many-Ponies, for
 whose physical and moral welfare Luck would be held responsible. Bill had
 deliberately chosen to steal rather than work for honest wages, and had
 preferred the unstable friendship of Ramon Chavez to the cleaner life in
 Luck's company. He did not credit Bill Holmes with anything stronger than
 a weak-souled treachery. Ramon, he told himself while he made his way down
 the arroyo side, was at least working out a clever scheme of his own, and
 it rested with Luck and his posse to see that Ramon was cheated of
 success.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So deeply was he engrossed that before he realized it he was down where
 they had left Applehead's party. There was no sign of them anywhere, so
 Luck went down and mounted his horse and led the way down the arroyo.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Already the heat was lessening and the land was taking on those
 translucent opal tints which make of New Mexico a land of enchantment. The
 far hills enveloped themselves in a faint, purplish haze through which
 they seemed to blush unwittingly. The mesa, no longer showing itself an
 and waste of heat and untracked wilderness, lay soft under a thin veil of
 many ethereal tints. Away off to the northeast they heard the thin, vague
 clamor of a band of sheep and the staccato barking of a dog.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck rode for some distance, his uneasiness growing as the shadows
 deepened with the setting of the sun. They had gone too far to hear any
 whistled signal, but it seemed to him reasonable to suppose that Applehead
 would return to their starting point, whether he found the trail or not;
 or at least send a man back. Luck began to think more seriously of
 Applehead's numerous warnings about the Indians?and yet, there had
 been no sound of shooting, which is the first sign of trouble in this
 country. Rifle shots can be heard a long way in this clear air; so Luck
 presently dismissed that worry and gave his mind to the very real one
 which assailed them all; which was water for their horses.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys were riding along in silence, sitting over to one side with a
 foot dangling free of its stirrup; except Andy, who had hooked one leg
 over the saddle-horn and was riding sidewise, smoking a meditative
 cigarette and staring out between the ears of his horse. They were tired;
 horses and men, they were tired to the middle of their bones. But they
 went ahead without making any complaints whatever or rasping oneanother's
 tempers with ill-chosen remarks; and for that Luck's eyes brightened with
 appreciation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently, when they had ridden at least a mile down the arroyo, a gray
 hat-crown came bobbing into sight over a low tongue of rocky ground that
 cut the channel almost in two. The horses threw up their heads and perked
 cars forward inquiringly, and in a moment Happy Tack came into view, his
 gloomy, sunburned face wearing a reluctant grin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, we got on the trail," he announced as soon as he was close enough.
 "And we follered it to water. Applehead says fer you to come on and make
 camp. Tracks are fresher around that' water-hole'n what they have been,
 an' Applehead, he's all enthused. I betche we land them fellers t'morrow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Out of the arroyo in a place where the scant grassland lapped down over
 the edge, Happy Jack led the way and the rest followed eagerly. Too often
 had they made dry camp not to feel jubilant over the prospect even of a
 brackish water-hole. Even the horses seemed to know and to step out more
 briskly. Straight across the mesa with its deceptive lights that concealed
 distance behind a glamor of intimate nearness, they rode into the
 deepening dusk that had a glow all through it. After a while they dipped
 into a grassy draw so shallow that they hardly realized the descent until
 they dismounted at the bottom, where Applehead was already starting a fire
 and the others were laying out their beds and doing the hundred little
 things that make for comfort in camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A few bushes and a stunted tree or two marked the spring that seeped down
 and fed a shallow water-hole where the horses drank thirstily. Applehead
 grinned and pointed to the now familiar hoofprints which they had followed
 so far.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I calc'late Ramon done a heap uh millin' around back there in that rocky
 arroyo," he observed, "'fore he struck off over here. Er else they was
 held up fer some reason, 'cause them tracks is fresher a hull lot than
 what them was that passed the Injun ranch. Musta laid over here las'
 night, by the looks. But I figgered that we'd best camp whilst we had
 water, 'n' take up the trail agin at daybreak. Ain't that about the way
 you see it, Luck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, certainly," Luck assured him with as much heartiness as his utter
 weariness would permit. "Men and horses, we're about all in. If Ramon was
 just over the next ridge, I don't know but it would pay to take our rest
 before we overhaul them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They's grass here, yuh notice," Applehead pointed out. "I'll put the bell
 on Johnny, and if Pink'll bobble that buckskin that's allus wantin' to
 wander off by hisself, I calc'late we kin settle down an' rest our bones
 quite awhile b'fore anybody needs to go on guard. Them ponies ain't goin'
 to stray fur off if they don't have to, after the groun' they covered
 t'day?now I'm tellin' yuh! They'll save their steps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There is a superstition about prophesying too boastfully that a certain
 thing will or will not happen; you will remember that there is also a
 provision that the rash prophet may avert disaster by knocking wood.
 Applehead should, if there is any grain of sense in the rite, have knocked
 wood with his fingers crossed as an extra precaution, against evil
 fortune.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For after they had eaten and methodically packed away the food, and while
 they were lying around the cheerful glow of their little campfire,
 misfortune stole up out of the darkness unaware. They talked desultorily
 as tired men will, their alertness dulled by the contented tinkle-tinkle
 of the little bell strapped around the neck of big, bay Johnny,
 Applehead's companion of many a desert wandering. That brilliant
 constellation which seems to hang just over one's head in the high
 altitude of our sagebrush states, held hypnotically the sleepy gaze of
 Pink, whose duty it was to go on guard when the others turned in for the
 night. He lay with his locked fingers under his head, staring up at one
 particularly bright group of stars, and listened to the droning voice of
 Applehead telling of a trip he had made out into this country five or six
 years before; and soaking in the peace and the comfort which was all the
 more precious because he knew that soon he must drag his weary body into
 the saddle and ride out to stand guard over the horses. Once he half rose,
 every movement showing his reluctance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon Weary, who sprawled next to him, reached out a languid foot and
 gave him a poke. "Aw, lay down," he advised. "They're all right out there
 for another hour. Don't yuh hear the bell?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They all listened for a minute. The intermittent tinkle of the cheap
 little sheep bell came plainly to them from farther down the draw as
 though Johnny was eating contentedly with his mates, thankful for the
 leisure and the short, sweet grass that was better than hay. Pink lay back
 with a sigh of relief, and Luck told him to sleep a little if he wanted
 to, because everything was all right and he would call him if the horses
 got to straying too far off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down the draw?where there were no horses feeding?an Indian in
 dirty overalls and gingham shirt and moccasins, and with his hair bobbed
 to his collar, stood up and peered toward the vague figures grouped in the
 fire-glow. He lifted his hand and moved it slightly, so that the bell he
 was holding tinkled exactly as it had done when it was strapped around
 Johnny's neck; Johnny, who was at that moment trailing disgustedly over a
 ridge half a mile away with his mates, driven by two horsemen who rode
 very carefully, so as to make no noise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The figures settled back reassured, and the Indian grinned sourly and
 tinkled the little bell painstakingly, with the matchless patience of the
 Indian. It was an hour before he dimly saw Pink get up from the dying
 coals and mount his horse. Then, still tinkling the bell as a feeding
 horse would have made it ring, he moved slowly down the draw; slowly, so
 that Pink did not at first suspect that the bell sounded farther off than
 before; slowly yet surely, leading Pink farther and farther in the hope of
 speedily overtaking the horses that he cursed for their wandering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink wondered, after a little, what was the matter with the darned things,
 wandering off like that by themselves, and with no possible excuse that he
 could see. For some time he was not uneasy; he expected to overtake them
 within the next five or ten minutes. They would stop to feed, surely, or
 to look back and listen?in a strange country like this it was
 against horse-nature that they should wander far away at night unless they
 were thirsty and on the scent of water. These horses had drunk their fill
 at the little pool below the spring. They should be feeding now, or they
 should lie down and sleep, or stand up and sleep?anything but travel
 like this, deliberately away from camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink tried loping, but the ground was too treacherous and his horse too
 leg-weary to handle its feet properly in the dark. It stumbled several
 times, so he pulled down again to a fast walk. For a few minutes he did
 not hear the bell at all, and when he did it was not where he had expected
 to hear it, but away off to one side. So he had gained nothing save in
 anger and uneasiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no use going back to camp and rousing the boys, for he was now a
 mile or so away; and they would be afoot, since their custom was to keep
 but one horse saddled. When he went in to call the next guard he would be
 expected to bring that man's horse back with him, and would turn his own
 loose before he went to sleep. Certainly there was nothing to be gained by
 rousing the camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not suspect the trick being played upon him, though he did wonder
 if someone was leading the horses away. Still, in that case whoever did it
 would surely have sense enough to muffle the bell. Besides, it sounded
 exactly like a horse feeding and moving away at random?which, to
 those familiar with the sound, can never be mistaken for the tinkle of an
 animal traveling steadily to some definite point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was an extremely puzzled young man who rode and rode that night in
 pursuit of that evasive, nagging, altogether maddening tinkle. Always just
 over the next little rise he would hear it, or down in the next little
 draw; never close enough for him to discover the trick; never far enough
 away for him to give up the chase. The stars he had been watching in camp
 swam through the purple immensity above him and slid behind the skyline.
 Other stars as brilliant appeared and began their slow, swimming journey.
 Pink rode, and stopped to listen, and rode on again until it seemed to him
 that he must be dreaming some terribly realistic nightmare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He was sitting on his horse on a lava-crusted ridge, straining bloodshot
 eyes into the mesa that stretched dimly before him, when dawn came
 streaking the sky with blood orange and purple and crimson. The stars were
 quenched in that flood of light; and Pink, looking now with clearer
 vision, saw that there was no living thing in sight save a coyote trotting
 home from his night's hunting. He turned short around and, getting his
 bearings from his memory of certain stars and from the sun that was
 peering at him from the top of a bare peak, and from that sense of
 direction which becomes second nature to a man who had lived long on the
 range, started for camp with his ill news.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIV. ONE PUT OVER ON THE BUNCH
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Sounds to me," volunteered the irrepressible Big Medicine after a heavy
 silence, "like as if you'd gone to sleep on your hawse, Little One, and
 dreamed that there tinkle-tinkle stuff. By cripes, I'd like to see the
 bell-hawse that could walk away from ME 'nless I was asleep an' dreamin'
 about it. Sounds like?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sounds like Navvy work," Applehead put in, eyeing the surrounding rim of
 sun-gilded mesa, where little brown birds fluttered in short, swift
 flights and chirped with exasperating cheerfulness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it was anybody, it was Ramon Chavez," Luck declared with the
 positiveness of his firm conviction. "By the tracks here, we're crowding
 up on him. And no man that's guilty of a crime, Applehead, is going to
 ride day after day without wanting to take a look over his shoulder to see
 if be's followed. He's probably seen us from some of these ridges?yesterday,
 most likely. And do you think he wouldn't know this bunch as far as he
 could see us, even without glasses? The chances are he has them, though.
 He'd be a fool if he didn't stake himself to a pair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, by gracious," Andy observed somewhat irrelevantly, his eyes going
 over the group, "this would sure make great picture dope, wouldn't it? Why
 didn't we bring Pete along, darn it? Us all standing around here, plumb
 helpless because we're afoot?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, shut up!" snapped Pink, upon whom the burden of responsibility lay
 heavy. "I oughta be hung for laying around the fire here instead of being
 out there on guard! I oughta?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ain't your fault," Weary championed him warmly. "We all heard the bell?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?and damn it,<i>I</i> heard the bell from then on till
 daylight!" Pink's lips quivered perceptibly with the mortification that
 burned within him. "If I'd been on guard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I calc'late you'd a been laid out now with a knife-cut in yuh
 som'ers," Applehead stopped twisting his sunburnt mustache to say bluntly.
 "'S a dang lucky thing fer you, young man, 't you WASN'T on guard, 'n' the
 only thing't looks queer to me is that you wasn't potted las' night when
 yuh got out away from here. Musta been only one of 'em stayed behind, an'
 he had t' keep out in front uh yuh t' tinkle that dang bell. Figgered on
 wearin' out yer hoss, I reckon, 'n' didn't skurcely dare t' take the risk
 uh killin' you off 'nless they was a bunch around t' handle us." His
 bright blue eyes with their range squint went from one to another with a
 certain speculative pride in the glance. "'N' they shore want t' bring a
 crowd along when they tie into this yere outfit, now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lite Avery, who had gone prowling down the draw by himself, came back to
 camp, tilting stiff-leggedly along in his high-heeled boots and betraying,
 in every step he took, just how handicapped a cowpuncher is when set afoot
 upon the range and forced to walk where he has always been accustomed to
 ride. He stopped to give Pink's exhausted horse a sympathetic pat on the
 shoulder, and came on, grinning a little with the comers of his mouth
 tipped down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here's what's left of the hobbles the buckskin wore," he said, holding up
 the cut loops of a figure-eight rope hobble. "Kinda speaks for itself,
 don't it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They crowded around to inspect this plain evidence of stealing. Afterwards
 they stood hard-eyed and with a flush on their cheek-bones, considering
 what was the best and wisest way to meet this emergency. As to hunting
 afoot for their horses, the chance of success was almost too small to be
 considered at all, Pink's horse was not fit for further travel until he
 had rested. There was one pair of field glasses?and there were nine
 irate men to whom inaction was intolerable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One thing we can do, if we have to," Luck said at last, with the fighting
 look in his face which moving-picture people had cause to remember. "We
 can help ourselves to any horses we run across. Applehead, how's the best
 way to go about it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead, thus pushed into leadership, chewed his mustache and eyed the
 mesa sourly. "Well, seein' they've set us afoot, I calc'late we're jest
 about entitled to any dang thing we run across that's ridable," he
 acceded. "'N' the way I'd do, would be to git on high groun' with them
 glasses 'n' look fer hosses. 'N' then head fer 'em 'n' round 'em up afoot
 'n' rope out what we want. They's enough of us t' mebby git a mount
 apiece, but it shore ain't goin' t' be no snap, now I'm tellin' ye. 'N' if
 yuh do that," he added, "yuh want t' leave a man er two in camp?'n'
 they want to keep their dang eyes peeled, lemme tell yuh! Ef we was t'
 find ourselves afoot an' our grub 'n' outfit stole?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We won't give them that chance at us." Luck was searching with his eyes
 for the nearest high point that was yet not too far from camp. "I think
 I'll just take Andy up on that pinnacle there, and camp down by that pile
 of boulders. The rest of you stay around camp and rest yourselves while
 you've got the chance. In a couple of hours, Applehead, you and Lite come
 up and take our place; then Miguel and Bud, and after that Weary and
 Happy. Pink, you go and bed down in the shade somewhere and go to sleep?and
 quit worrying over last night. Nobody could have done any better than you
 did. It was just one put over on the bunch, and you happened to be the
 particular goat, that's all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, if one of us waves his hat over his head, all of you but Happy and
 Bud and Pink come up with your rifles and your ropes, because we'll have
 some horses sighted. If we wave from side to side, like this, about even
 with our belts, you boys want to look out for trouble. So one of you keep
 an eye on us all the time we're up there. We'll be up outa reach of any
 trouble ourselves, if I remember that little pinnacle right." He hung the
 strap that held the leather case of the glasses over one shoulder, picked
 up his rifle and his rope and started off, with Andy similarly equipped
 coming close behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mesa, when they reached the pinnacle and looked down over the wide
 expanse of it, glimmered like clear, running water with the heat waves
 that rose from the sand. Away to the southward a scattered band of sheep
 showed in a mirage that made them look long-legged as camels and half
 convinced them both that they were seeing the lost horses, until the
 vision changed and shrunk the moving objects to mere dots upon the mesa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Often before they had watched the fantastic air-pictures of the desert
 mirage, and they knew well enough that what they saw might be one mile
 away or twenty. But unless the atmospheric conditions happened to be just
 right, what was pictured in the air could not be depended upon to portray
 truthfully what was reflected. They sat there and saw the animals suddenly
 grow clearly defined and very close, and discovered at last that they were
 sheep, and that a man was walking beside the flock; and even while they
 watched it and wondered if the sheep were really as close as they seemed,
 the vision slowly faded into blank, wavery distance and the mesa lay empty
 and quivering under the sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine chance we've got of locating anything," Andy grumbled, "if it's
 going to be miragy all day. We could run our fool heads off trying to get
 up to a bunch that would puff out into nothing. Makes a fellow think of
 the stories they tell about old prospectors going crazy trying to find
 mirage water-holes. I'm glad we didn't get hung up at a dry camp, Luck.
 Yuh realize what that would be like?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I may have some faint idea," Luck drawled whimsically. "Look over
 there, Andy over toward Albuquerque. Is that a mirage again, or do you see
 something moving?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Andy, having the glasses, swung them slowly to the southeast. After a
 minute or two he shook his head and gave the glasses to Luck. "There was
 one square look I got, and I'd been willing to swear it was our
 saddle-bunch," he said. "And then they got to wobbling and I couldn't make
 out what they are. They might be field mice, or they might be giraffes?I'm
 darned if I know which."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck focussed the glasses, but whatever the objects had been, they were no
 longer to be seen. So the two hours passed and they saw Applehead and Lite
 come slowly up the hill from camp bearing their rifles and their ropes and
 a canteen of fresh water, as the three things they might find most use
 for.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These two settled themselves to watch for horses?their own range
 horses. When they were relieved they reported nothing save a continued
 inclination on the part of the atmosphere to be what Andy called miragy.
 So, the day passed, chafing their spirits worse than any amount of active
 trouble would have done. Pink slept and brooded by turns, still blaming
 himself for the misfortune. The others moped, or took their turns on the
 pinnacle to strain their eyes unavailingly into the four corners of the
 earth?or as much as they could in those directions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With the going of the sun Applehead and Lite, sitting out their second
 guard on the pinnacle, discussed seriously the desperate idea of going in
 the night to the nearest Navajo ranch and helping themselves to what
 horses they could find about the place. The biggest obstacle was their
 absolute ignorance of where the nearest ranch lay. Not, surely, that
 half-day's ride back towards Albuquerque, where they had seen but one pony
 and that a poor specimen of horseflesh. Another obstacle would be the
 dogs, which could be quieted only with bullets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We might git hold of something to ride," Applehead stated glumly, "an'
 then agin the chances is we wouldn't git nothin' more'n a scrap on our
 hands. 'N' I'm tellin' yuh right now, Lite, I ain't hankerin' fer no fuss
 till I git a hoss under me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me either," Lite testified succinctly. "Say, is that something coming,
 away up that draw the camp's in? Seems to me I saw something pass that
 line of lava, about half a mile over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead stood up and peered into the half darkness. In a couple of
 minutes he said: "Ye better git down an' tell the boys t' be on the watch,
 Lite. They can't see no hat-wavin' this time uh day. They's somethin'
 movin' up to-wards camp, but what er who they be I can't make out in the
 dark. Tell Luck?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter with us both going?" Lite asked, cupping his hands
 around his eyes that he might see better. "It's getting too dark to do any
 good up here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I calc'late mebby yore right," Applehead admitted, and began to
 pick his way down over the rocks. "Ef them's Injuns, the bigger we stack
 up in camp the better. If it's Ramon 'n' his bunch, I want t' git m' hands
 on 'im."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He must have turned the matter over pretty thoroughly in his mind, for
 when the two reached camp he had his ideas fixed and his plans all
 perfected. He told Luck that somebody was working down the draw in the
 dark, and that it looked like a Navvy trick; and that they had better be
 ready for them, because they weren't coming just to pass the time of day?"now
 I'm tellin' ye!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The nerves of the Happy Family were raw enough by now to welcome anything
 that promised action; even an Indian fight would not be so much a disaster
 as a novel way of breaking the monotony. Applehead, with the experience
 gathered in the old days when he was a young fellow with a freighting
 outfit and old Geronimo was terrorizing all this country, sent them back
 in compact half circle just within the shelter of the trees and several
 rods away from their campfire and the waterhole. There, lying crouched
 behind their saddles with their rifles across the seat-sides and with
 ammunition belts full of cartridges, they waited for whatever might be
 coming in the dark.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's horses," Pink exclaimed under his breath, as faint sounds came down
 the draw. "Maybe?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Horses?and an Injun laying along the back of every one, most
 likely," Applehead returned grimly. "An old Navvy trick, that is?don't
 let 'em fool ye, boys! You jest wait, 'n' I'll tell ye 'when t' shoot, er
 whether t' shoot at all. They can't fool ME?now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After that they were silent, listening strainedly to the growing sounds of
 approach. There was the dull, unmistakable click of a hoof striking
 against a rock, the softer sound of treading on yielding soil. Then a blur
 of dark objects became visible, moving slowly and steadily toward the
 camp.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, it's just horses," Happy Jack muttered disgustedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead stretched a lean leg in his direction and gave Happy Jack a
 kick. "They're cunnin'," he hissed warningly. "Don't yuh be fooled?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's Johnny in the lead," Pink whispered excitedly. "I'd know the way
 he walks?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'N' you THOUGHT yuh knowed how he jingled his dang bell," Applehead
 retorted unkindly. "Sh-sh-sh?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Reminded by the taunt of the clever trick that had been played upon them
 the night before, the Happy Family stiffened again into strained, waiting
 silence, their rifles aimed straight at the advancing objects. These,
 still vague in the first real darkness of early night, moved steadily in a
 scattered group behind a leader that was undoubtedly Johnny of the
 erstwhile tinkling bell. He circled the campfire just without its radius
 of light, so that they could not tell whether an Indian lay along his
 back, and beaded straight for the water-hole. The others followed him, and
 not one came into the firelight?a detail which sharpened the
 suspicions of the men crouched there in the edge of the bushes, and
 tingled their nerves with the sense of something sinister in the very
 unconcernedness of the animals.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They splashed into the water-hole and drank thirstily and long. They stood
 there as though they were luxuriating in the feel of more water than they
 could drink, and one horse blew the moisture from his nostrils with a
 sound that made Happy Jack jump.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a few minutes that seemed an hour to those who waited with fingers
 crooked upon gun-triggers, the horse that looked vaguely like Johnny
 turned away from the water-hole and sneezed while he appeared to be
 wondering what to do next. He moved slowly toward the packs that were
 thrown down just where they had been taken from the horses, and began
 nosing tentatively about.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The others loitered still at the water-hole, save one?the buckskin,
 by his lighter look in the dark?that came over to Johnny. The two
 horses nosed the packs. A dull sound of clashing metal came to the ears of
 the Happy Family.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey! Get outa that grain, doggone your fool hide," Pink called out
 impulsively, crawling over his saddle and catching his foot in the stirrup
 leather so that he came near going headlong.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead yelled something, but Pink had recovered his balance and was
 running to save the precious horsefeed from waste, and Johnny from
 foundering. There might have been two Indiana on every horse in sight, but
 Pink was not thinking of that possibility just then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Johnny whirled guiltily away from the grain bag, licking his lips and
 blowing dust from his nostrils. Pink went up to him and slipped a rope
 around his neck. "Where's that bell?" he called out in his soft treble.
 "Or do you think we better tie the old son-of-a-gun up and be sure of
 him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw," said Happy Jack disgustedly a few minutes later, when the Happy
 Family had crawled out of their ambush and were feeling particularly
 foolish. "Nex' time old granny Furrman says Injuns t' this bunch, somebody
 oughta gag him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I notice you waited till he'd gone outa hearing before you said that,"
 Luck told him drily. "We're going to put out extra guards tonight, just
 the same. And I guess you can stand the first shift, Happy, up there on
 the ridge?you're so sure of things!"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XV. "NOW, DANG IT, RIDE!"
 </h2>
 <p>
 Indians are Indians, though they wear the green sweater and overalls of
 civilization and set upon their black hair the hat made famous by John B.
 Stetson. You may meet them in town and think them tamed to stupidity. You
 may travel out upon their reservations and find them shearing sheep or
 hoeing corn or plodding along the furrow, plowing their fields; or you may
 watch them dancing grotesquely in their festivals, and still think that
 civilization is fast erasing the savage instincts from their natures. You
 will be partly right?but you will also be partly mistaken. An Indian
 is always an Indian, and a Navajo Indian carries a thinner crust of
 civilization than do some others; as I am going to illustrate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As you have suspected, the Happy Family was not following the trail of
 Ramon Chavez and his band. Ramon was a good many miles away in another
 direction; unwittingly the Happy Family was keeping doggedly upon the
 trail of a party of renegade Navajos who had been out on a thieving
 expedition among those Mexicans who live upon the Rio Grande bottomland.
 Having plenty of reasons for hurrying back to their stronghold, and having
 plenty of lawlessness to account for, when they realized that they were
 being followed by nine white men who had four packed horses with them to
 provide for their needs on a long journey, it was no more than natural
 that the Indians should take it for granted that they were being pursued,
 and that if they were caught they would be taken back to town and shut up
 in that evil place which the white men called their jail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When it was known that the nine men who followed had twice recovered the
 trail after sheep and cattle had trampled it out, the renegades became
 sufficiently alarmed to call upon their tribesmen for help. And that was
 perfectly natural and sensible from their point of view.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, the Navajos are peaceable enough if you leave them strictly alone and
 do not come snooping upon their reservation trying to arrest somebody. But
 they don't like jails, and if you persist in trailing their lawbreakers
 you are going to have trouble on your hands. The Happy Family, with Luck
 and Applehead, had no intention whatever of molesting the Navajos; but the
 Navajos did not know that, and they acted according to their lights and
 their ideas of honorable warfare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Roused to resistance in behalf of their fellows, they straightway forsook
 their looms, where they wove rugs for tourists, and the silver which they
 fashioned into odd bracelets and rings; and the flocks of sheep whose wool
 they used in the rugs and they went upon a quiet, crafty warpath against
 these persistent white men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They stole their horses and started them well on the trail back to
 Albuquerque?since it is just as well to keep within the white men's
 law, if it may be done without suffering any great inconvenience. They
 would have preferred to keep the horses, but they decided to start them
 home and let them go. You could not call that stealing, and no one need go
 to jail for it. They failed to realize that these horses might be so
 thoroughly broken to camp ways that they would prefer the camp of the
 Happy Family to a long trail that held only a memory of discomfort; they
 did not know that every night these horses were given grain by the
 camp-fire, and that they would remember it when feeding time came again.
 So the horses, led by wise old Johnny, swung in a large circle when their
 Indian drivers left them, and went back to their men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the Navajos, finding that simple maneuver a failure?and too
 late to prevent its failing without risk of being discovered and forced
 into an open fight?got together and tried something else; something
 more characteristically Indian and therefore more actively hostile. They
 rode in haste that night to a point well out upon the fresh trail of their
 fleeing tribesmen, where the tracks came out of a barren, lava-encrusted
 hollow to softer soil beyond. They summoned their squaws and their
 half-grown papooses armed with branches that had stiff twigs and answered
 the purpose of brooms. With great care about leaving any betraying tracks
 of their own until they were quite ready to leave a trail, a party was
 formed to represent the six whom the Happy Family bad been following.
 These divided and made off in different directions, leaving a plain trail
 behind them to lure the white men into the traps which would be prepared
 for them farther on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When dawn made it possible to do so effectively, the squaws began to whip
 out the trail of the six renegade Indians, and the chance footprints of
 those who bad gone ahead to leave the false trail for the white men to
 follow. Very painstakingly the squaws worked, and the young ones who could
 be trusted. Brushing the sand smoothly across a hoofprint here, and
 another one there; walking backward, their bodies bent, their sharp eyes
 scanning every little depression, every faint trace of the passing of
 their tribesmen; brushing, replacing pebbles kicked aside by a hoof,
 wiping out completely that trail which the Happy Family bad followed with
 such persistence, the squaws did their part, while their men went on to
 prepare the trap.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Years ago?yet not so many after all?the mothers of these
 squaws, and their grandmothers, had walked backward and stooped with
 little branches in their hands to wipe out the trail of their warriors and
 themselves to circumvent the cunning of the enemy who pursued. So had they
 brushed out the trail when their men had raided the ranchos of the first
 daring settlers, and had driven off horses and cattle into the remoter
 wilderness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And these, mind you, were the squaws and bucks whom you might meet any day
 on the streets in Albuquerque, padding along the pavement and staring in
 at the shop windows, admiring silken gowns with marked-down price tags,
 and exclaiming over flaxen-haired dolls and bright ribbon streamers;
 squaws and bucks who brought rugs and blankets to sell, and who would
 bargain with you in broken English and smile and nod in friendly fashion
 if you spoke to them in Spanish or paid without bickering the price they
 asked for a rug. You might see them in the fifteen-cent store, buying
 cheap candy and staring in mute admiration at all the gay things piled
 high on the tables. Remember that, when I tell you what more they did out
 here in the wilderness. Remember that and do not imagine that I am trying
 to take you back into the untamed days of the pioneers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck and the Happy Family?so well had the squaws done their work?passed
 unsuspectingly over the wiped-out trail, circled at fault on the far side
 of the rocky gulch for an hour or so and then found the false trail just
 as the Indian decoys had intended that they should do. And from a farther
 flat topped ridge a group of Indians with Dutch hair-cuts and Stetson hats
 and moccasins (the two hall-marks of two races) watched them take the
 false trail, and looked at one another and grinned sourly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The false trail forked, showing that the six had separated into two
 parties of three riders, each aiming to pass?so the hoofprints would
 lead one to believe?around the two ends of a lone hill that sat
 squarely down on the mesa like a stone treasure chest dropped there by the
 gods when the world was young.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Happy Family drew rein and eyed the parting of the ways dubiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wonder what they did that for?" Andy Green grumbled, mopping his red face
 irritatedly. "We've got trouble enough without having them split up on
 us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "From the looks, I should say we're overhauling the bunch," Luck hazarded.
 "They maybe met on the other side of this butte somewhere. And the tracks
 were made early this morning, I should say. How about it, Applehead?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, they look fresher 'n what we bin follerin' before," Applehead
 admitted. "But I don't like this here move uh theirn, and I'm tellin' yuh
 so. The way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't like anything about 'em," snapped Luck, standing in his stirrups
 as though that extra three inches would let him see over the hill. "And I
 don't like this tagging along behind, either. You take your boys and
 follow those tracks to the right, Applehead. I and my bunch will go this
 other way. And RIDE! We can't be so awfully much behind. If they meet,
 we'll meet where they do. If they scatter, we'll have to scatter too, I
 reckon. But get'em is the word, boys!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And where," asked Applehead with heavy irony, while he pulled at his
 mustache, "do yuh calc'late we'll git t'gether agin if we go scatterin'
 out?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck looked at him and smiled his smile. "We aren't any of us tenderfeet,
 exactly," he said calmly. "We'll meet at the jail when we bring in our
 men, if we don't meet anywhere else this side. But if you land your men,
 come back to that camp where we lost the horses. That's one, place we KNOW
 has got grass and water both. If you come and don't see any sign of us,
 wait a day before you start back to town. We'll do the same. And leave a
 note anchored in the crack of that big bowlder by the spring, telling the
 news. We'll do the same if we get there first and don't wait for you." He
 hesitated, betraying that even in his eagerness he too dreaded the parting
 of the ways. "Well, so long, boys?take care of yourselves."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, I ain't so dang shore?" Applehead began querulously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Luck only grinned and waved his hand as he led the way to the south on
 the trail that obviously had skirted the side of the square butte. The
 four who went with him looked back and waved non-committal adieu; and Big
 Medicine, once he was fairly away, shouted back to them to look out for
 Navvies, and then laughed with a mirthless uproar that deceived no one
 into thinking he was amused. Pink and Weary raised their voices
 sufficiently to tell him where he could go, and settled themselves
 dejectedly in their saddles again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I ain't so darned sure, either," Lite Avery tardily echoed
 Applehead's vague statement, in the dry way he had of speaking detached
 sentiments from the mental activities that went on behind his calm,
 mask-like face and his quiet eyes. "Something feels snaky around here
 today."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead looked at him with a glimmer of relief in his eyes, but he did
 not reply to the foreboding directly. "Boys, git yore rifles where you kin
 use 'em quick," he advised them grimly. "I kin smell shootin' along this
 dang trail."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink's dimples showed languidly for a moment, and he looked a question at
 Weary. Weary grinned answer and pulled his rifle from the "boot" where it
 was slung under his right leg, and jerked the lever forward until a
 cartridge slid with a click up into the chamber; let the hammer gently
 down with his thumb and laid the gun across his thighs.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's ready for bear," he observed placidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, you boys show some kinda sense," Applehead told them when Pink
 had followed Weary's example. "Fellers like Happy and Bud, they shore do
 show their ign'rance uh this here, dang country, when they up 'n' laff at
 the idee uh trouble?now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the ridge which was no more than a high claw of the square butte,
 four Indians in greasy, gray Stetsons with flat crowns nodded with grim
 satisfaction, and then made baste to point the toes of their moccasins
 down to where their unkempt ponies stood waiting. They were too far away
 to, see the shifting of rifles to the laps of the riders, or perhaps they
 would not have felt quite so satisfied with the steady advance of the four
 who had taken the right-hand fork of the trail. They could not even tell
 just which four men made up the party. They did not greatly care, so long
 as the force of the white men was divided. They galloped away upon urgent
 business of their own, elated because their ruse had worked out as they
 had planned and hoped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead took a restrained pull at the canteen, cocked his eyes back at
 the butte they had just passed, squinted ahead over the flat waste that
 shimmered with heat to the very skyline that was notched and gashed
 crudely with more barren hills, and then, screwing the top absent-mindedly
 on the canteen-mouth, leaned and peered long at the hoofprints they were
 following. Beside him Lite Avery, tall and lean to the point of being
 skinny, followed his movements with quiet attention and himself took to
 studying more closely the hoofprints in the sandy soil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead looked up, gauged the probable direction the trail was taking,
 and gave a grunt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You kin call me a fool," he said with a certain challenge in his tone,
 "but this yere trail don't look good to me, somehow. These yere tracks,
 they don't size up the same as they done all the way out here. 'N' another
 thing, they ain't aimed t' meet up with the bunch that Luck's trailin'.
 We're headed straight out away from whar Luck's headed. 'N' any way yuh
 look at it, we're headed into country whar there ain't no more water'n
 what the rich man got in hell. What would any uh Ramon's outfit want to
 come away off in here fur? They ain't nothin' up in here to call 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These," said Lite suddenly, "are different horse-tracks. They're smaller,
 for one thing. The bunch we followed out from the red machine rode bigger
 horses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And carried honey on one side and fresh meat on the other; and one horse
 was blind in the right eye," enlarged Pink banteringly, remembering the
 story of the Careful Observer in an old schoolreader of his childhood
 days.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, how do you make that out, Lite? I never noticed any difference in
 the tracks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The stride is a little shorter today for one thing." Lite looked around
 and grinned at Pink, as though he too remembered the dromedary loaded with
 honey and meat. "Ain't it, Applehead?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It shore is," Applehead testified, his face bent toward the hot ground.
 "Ain't ary one uh the three that travels like they bin a travelin'?'n'
 that shore means something, now I'm tellin' yuh!" He straightened and
 stared worriedly ahead of them again. "Uh course, they might a picked up
 fresh horses," he admitted. "I calc'late they needed 'em bad enough, if
 they ain't been grainin' their own on the trip."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We didn't see any signs of their horses being turned loose anywhere
 along," Lite pointed out with a calm confidence that he was right.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still, they followed the footprints even though they were beginning to
 admit with perfect frankness their uneasiness. They were swinging
 gradually toward one of those isolated bumps of red rockridges which you
 will find scattered at random through certain parts of the southwest.
 Perhaps they held some faint hope that what lay on the other side of the
 ridge would be more promising, just as we all find ourselves building
 air-castles upon what lies just over the horizon which divides present
 facts from future possibilities. Besides, these flat-faced ledges
 frequently formed a sharp dividing line between barren land and fertile,
 and the hoofprints led that way; so it was with a tacit understanding that
 they would see what lay beyond the ridge that they rode forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly Applehead, eyeing the rocks speculatively, turned his head
 suddenly to look behind and to either side like one who seeks a way of
 escape from sudden peril.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't make no quick moves, boys," he said, waving one gloved band
 nonchalantly toward the flat land from which they were turning, "but
 foller my lead 'n' angle down into that draw off here. Mebbe it's deep
 enough to put us outa sight, 'n' mebbe it ain't. But we'll try it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's up? What did yuh see?" Pink and Weary spoke in a duet, urging
 their horses a little closer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You fellers keep back thar 'n' don't act excited!" Applehead eyed them
 sternly over his shoulder. "I calc'late we're just about t' walk into a
 trap." He bent?on the side away from the ridge?low over his
 horse's shoulder and spoke while he appeared to be scanning the ground. "I
 seen gun-shine up among them rocks, er I'm a goat. 'N' if it's Navvies,
 you kin bet they got guns as good as ours, and kin shoot mighty nigh as
 straight as the best of us?except Lite, uh course, that's a expert."
 He pointed aimlessly at the ground and edged toward the draw.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ef they think we're jest follerin' a stray track, they'll likely hold off
 till we git back in the trail 'n' start comin' on agin," he explained
 craftily, still pointing at the ground ahead of him and still urging his
 horse to the draw. "Ef they suspicion 't we're shyin' off from the ridge,
 they'll draw a fine bead 'n' cut loose. I knowed it," he added with a
 lugubrious complacency. "I told ye all day that I could smell trouble
 a-comin'; I knowed dang well 't we'd stir up a mess uh fightin' over here.
 I never come onto this dang res'vation yit, that I didn't have t' kill off
 a mess uh Navvies before I got offen it agin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," he said when they reached the edge of the sandy depression that had
 been gouged deeper by freshets and offered some shelter in case of attack,
 "you boys jest fool around here on the aidge 'n' foller me down here like
 you was jest curiouslike over what I'm locatin'. That'll keep them babies
 up there guessin' till we're all outa sight MEBBY!" He pulled down the
 corners of his mouth till his mustache-ends dropped a full inch, and
 lifted himself off his horse with a bored deliberation that was masterly
 in its convincingness. He stood looking at the ground for a moment and
 then began to descend leisurely into the draw, leading his horse behind
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You go next, Pink," Weary said shortly, and with his horse began edging
 him closer to the bank until Pink, unless he made some unwise
 demonstration of unwillingness, was almost forced to ride down the steep
 little slope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't look towards the ridge, boys," Applehead warned from below. "Weary,
 you come on down here next. Lite kin might' nigh shoot the dang triggers
 offen their guns 'fore they kin pull, if they go t' work 'n' start
 anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Weary, leaving Lite up there grinning sheepishly over the compliment,
 rode down because he was told to do so by the man in command. "You seem to
 forget that Lite's got a wife on his hands," he reproved as he went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lite's a-comin' right now," Applehead retorted, peering at the ridge a
 couple of hundred yards distant. "Git back down the draw 's fur's yuh kin
 b'fore yuh take out into the open agin. I'll wait a minute 'n' see?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ping-NG-NG!" a bullet, striking a rock on the edge of the draw fifty feet
 short of the mark, glanced and went humming over the hot waste.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, that shows they got a lookout up high, 't seen me watchin'
 that way. But it's hard t' git the range shootin' down, like that,"
 Applehead remarked, pulling his horse behind a higher part of the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Close beside him Lite's rifle spoke, its little steelshod message flying
 straight as a homing honeybee for the spitting flash he had glimpsed up
 there among the rocks. Whether he did any damage or not, a dozen rifles
 answered venomously and flicked up tiny spurts of sand in the close
 neighborhood of the four.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If they keep on trying," Lite commented drily, "they might make a
 killing, soon as they learn how to shoot straight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'S jest like them dang Injuns!" Applehead grumbled, shooing the three
 before him down the draw. "Four t' our one?it takes jest about that
 big a majority 'fore they feel comftable about buildin' up a fight. Lead
 yore bosses down till we're outa easy shootin' distance, boys, 'n' then
 we'll head out fer where Luck ought t' be. If they fixed a trap fer us,
 they've fixed another fer him, chances is, 'n! the sooner us fellers git
 t'gether the better show we'll all of us have. You kin see, the way they
 worked it to split the bunch, that they ain't so dang anxious t' tie into
 us when we're t'gether?'n' that's why we can't git t' Luck a dang
 bit too soon, now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Weary and Pink were finding things to say, also, but old Applehead went on
 with his monologue just as though they were listening. Lite showed a
 disposition to stop and take issue with the shooters who kept up a
 spiteful firing from the ridge. But Applehead stopped him as he was
 leveling his rifle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If yuh shoot," he pointed out, "they'll know jest where we air and how
 fast we're gittin' outa here. If yuh don't, unless their lookout kin see
 us movin' out, they got t' do a heap uh guessin' in the next few minutes.
 They only got one chancet in three uh guessin' right, 'cause we might be
 camped in one spot, 'n' then agin we might be crawlin' up closer, fer all
 they kin tell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 If they were guessing, they must have guessed right; for presently the
 four heard faint yells from behind them, and Applehead crawled up the bank
 to where he could look out across the level. What he saw made him slide
 hastily to the bottom again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They've clumb down and straddled their ponies," he announced grimly. "An'
 about a dozen is comin' down this way, keepin' under cover all they kin. I
 calc'late mebby we better crawl our bosses 'n' do some ridin' ourselves,
 boys." And he added grimly, "They ain't in good shootin' distance yit, 'n'
 they dassent show theirselves neither. We'll keep in this draw long as we
 kin. They're bound t' come careful till they git us located."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The footing was none the best, but the horses they rode had been running
 over untracked mesa-land since they were bandy-legged colts. They loped
 along easily, picking automatically the safest places whereon to set their
 feet, and leaving their riders free to attend to other important matters
 which proved their true value as horses that knew their business.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Soon the draw shallowed until they found themselves out in the open, with
 the square-topped mountain five miles or so ahead and a little to the
 left; a high, untraversable sandstone ledge to their right, and what
 looked like plain sailing straight ahead past the mountain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead twisted his body in the saddle and gave a grunt. "Throw some
 lead back at them hombres, Lite," he snapped. "And make a killin' if yuh
 kin. It'll make 'em mad, but it'll hold 'em back fer a spell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lite, the crack rifle-shot of Luck's company and the man who had taught
 Jean Douglas to shoot with such wonderful precision, wheeled his horse
 short around and pulled him to a stand, lined up his rifle sights and
 crooked his finger on the trigger. And away back there among the Indians a
 pony reared, and then pitched forward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I sure do bate to shoot down a horse," Lite explained shamefacedly, "but
 I never did kill a man?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, I calc'late mebby yuh will, 'fore you're let out from this yere
 meetin'," Applehead prophesied drily. "Now, dang it, RIDE!"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVI. ANNIE-MANY-PONIES WAITS
 </h2>
 <p>
 In the magic light of many unnamable soft shades which the sun leaves in
 New Mexico as a love token for his dark mistress night, Annie-Many-Ponies
 sat with her back against a high, flat rock at the place where Ramon had
 said she must wait for him, and stared somber-eyed at what she could see
 of the new land that bad held her future behind the Sandias; waiting for
 Ramon; and she wondered if Wagalexa Conka had come home from his
 picture-making in Bear Canon and was angry because she had gone; and
 shrank from the thought, and tried to picture what life with Ramon would
 be like, and whether his love would last beyond the wide ring of shiny
 gold that was to make her a wife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At her feet the little black dog lay licking his sore paws that had padded
 patiently after her all day. Beside the rock the black horse stood
 nibbling at some weeds awkwardly, because of the Spanish bit in his mouth.
 The horse was hungry, and the little black dog was hungry;
 Annie-Many-Ponies was hungry also, but she did not feel her, hunger so
 much, because of the heaviness that was in her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Ramon came he would bring food, or he would tell her where she might
 buy. The horse, too, would be fed?when Ramon came. And he would take
 her to the priest who was his friend, and together they would kneel before
 the priest. But first, if Ramon would wait, she wanted to confess her
 sins, so that she need not go into the new life bearing the sins of the
 old. The priest could pray away the ache that was in her heart; and then,
 with her heart light as air, she would be married with Ramon. It was long
 since she had confessed?not since the priest came to the agency when
 she was there, before she ran away to work in pictures for Wagalexa Conka.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before her the glow deepened and darkened. A rabbit hopped out of a thick
 clump of stunted bushes, sniffed the air that blew the wrong way to warn
 him, and began feeding. Shunka Chistala gathered his soft paws under him,
 scratched softly for a firm foothold in the ground, and when the rabbit,
 his back turned and the evening wind blowing full in his face, fed
 unsuspectingly upon some young bark that he liked, the little black dog
 launched himself suddenly across the space that divided them. There was a
 squeak and a thin, whimpering crying?and the little black dog, at
 least, was sure of his supper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, roused from her brooding, shivered a little when the
 rabbit cried. She started forward to save it?she who had taught the
 little black dog to hunt gophers and prairie-dogs!?and when she was
 too late she scolded the dog in the language of the Sioux. She tore the
 rabbit away from him while he eyed her reproachfully; but when she saw
 that it was quite dead, she flung the warm body back to him and went and
 sat down again with her back to the rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A train whistled for the little station of Bernalillo, and soon she saw
 its headlight paint the squat houses that had before been hidden behind
 the creeping dusk. Ramon was late in coming and for one breath she caught
 herself hoping that he would not come at all. But immediately she
 remembered the love words he had taught her, and smiled her inscrutable
 little smile that had now a tinge of sadness. Perhaps, she thought
 wishfully, Ramon had come on the train from Albuquerque. Perhaps he had a
 horse in the town, and would ride out and meet her here where he had told
 her to wait.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The train shrieked and painted swiftly hill and embankment and little
 adobe huts and a corral full of huddled sheep, and went churning away to
 the northeast. Annie-Many-Ponies followed its course absently with her
 eyes until the last winking light from its windows and the last wisp of
 smoke was hidden behind hills and trees. The little black dog finished the
 rabbit, nosed its tracks back to where it had hopped out of the brush, and
 came back and curled up at the feet of his mistress, licking his lips and
 again his travel-sore paws. In a moment, feeling in his dumb way her
 loneliness, perhaps, he reached up and laid his pink tongue caressingly
 upon her brown hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dark came softly and with it a noisy wind that whistled and murmured and
 at last, growing more boisterous as the night deepened, whooped over her
 bead and tossed wildly the branches of a clump of trees that grew near.
 Annie-Many-Ponies listened to the wind and thought it a brother, perhaps,
 of the night wind that came to the Dakota prairies and caroused there
 until dawn bade it be still. Too red the blood of her people ran in her
 veins for her to be afraid of the night, even though she peopled it with
 dim shapes of her fancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After a long while the wind grew chill. Annie-Many-Ponies shivered, and
 then rose and went to the horse and, reaching into the bundle which was
 still bound to the saddle, she worked a plaid shawl loose from the other
 things and pulled it out and wrapped it close around her and pulled it
 over her head like a cowl. Then she went back and sat down against the
 bowlder, waiting, with the sublime patience of her kind, for Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Until the wind hushed, listening for the dawn, she sat there and waited.
 At her feet the little black dog slept with his nose folded between his
 front paws over which he whimpered sometimes in his dreams. At every
 little sound all through?the night Annie-Many-Ponies had listened,
 thinking that at last here came Ramon to take her to the priest, but for
 the first time since she had stolen out on the mesa to meet him, Ramon did
 not keep the tryst?and this was to be their marriage meeting!
 Annie-Many-Ponies grew very still and voiceless in her heart, as if her
 very soul waited. She did not even speculate upon what the future would be
 like if Ramon never came. She was waiting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then, just before the sky lightened, someone stepped cautiously along a
 little path that led through rocks and bushes back into the hills.
 Annie-Many Ponies turned her face that way and listened. But the steps
 were not the steps of Ramon; Annie-Many-Ponies had too much of the Indian
 keenness to be fooled by the hasty footsteps of this man. And since it was
 not Ramon?her slim fingers closed upon the keen-edged knife she
 carried always in its sinew-sewed buckskin sheath near her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little black dog lifted his head suddenly and growled, and the
 footsteps came to a sudden stop quite near the rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is you?" asked a cautious voice with the unmistakable Mexican tone and
 soft, slurring accent, "speak me what yoh name."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ramon comes?" Annie asked him quietly, and the footsteps came swiftly
 nearer until his form was silhouetted by the rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sh-sh?yoh not spik dat name," he whispered. "Luis Rojas me. I come
 for breeng yoh. No can come, yoh man. No spik name?som'bodys maybe
 hears."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies rose and stood peering at him through the dark. "What's
 wrong?" she asked abruptly, borrowing the curt phrase from Luck Lindsay.
 "Why I not speak name? Why?some body??" she laid ironical
 stress upon the word?"not come? What business you got, Luis Rojas?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?don' spik names, me!" The figure was seen to throw out an
 imploring hand. "Moch troubles, yoh bet! Yoh come now?somebodys she
 wait in dam-hurry!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, with her fingers still closed upon the bone handle of
 her sharp-edged knife, thought swiftly. Wariness had been born into her
 blood?therefore she could understand and meet halfway the wariness
 of another. Perhaps Wagalexa Conka had suspected that she was going with
 Ramon; Wagalexa Conka was very keen, and his anger blazed hot as
 pitch-pine flame. Perhaps Ramon feared Wagalexa Conka?as she, too,
 feared him. She was not afraid?she would go to Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She stepped away from the rock and took the black horse by its dropped
 bridle-reins and followed Luis Rojas up the dim path that wound through
 trees and rocks until it dropped into a little ravine that was chocked
 with brush, so that Annie-Many-Ponies had to put the stiff branches aside
 with her hand lest they scratch her face as she passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis went swiftly along the path, as though his haste was great; but he
 went stealthily as well, and she knew that he had some unknown cause for
 secrecy. She wondered a little at this. Had Wagalexa Conka discovered
 where she and Ramon were to meet? But how could he discover that which had
 been spoken but once, and then in the quiet loneliness of that place far
 back on the mesa? Wagalexa Conka bad not been within three miles of that
 place, as Annie-Many-Ponies knew well. How then did he know? For he must
 have followed, since Ramon dared not come to the place he had named for
 their meeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dawn came while they were still following the little, brush-choked ravine
 with its faint pathway up the middle of it, made by cattle or sheep or
 goats, perhaps all three. Luis hurried along, stopping now and then and
 holding up a hand for silence so that he might listen. Fast as he went,
 Annie-Many-Ponies kept within two long steps of his heels, her plaid shawl
 drawn smoothly over her black head and folded together under her chin. Her
 mouth was set in a straight line, and her chin had the square firmness of
 the Indian. Luis, looking back at her curiously, could not even guess at
 her thoughts, but he thought her too calm and cold for his effervescent
 nature?though he would have liked to tell her that she was
 beautiful. He did not, because he was afraid of Ramon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poco tiempo, come to his camp, Ramon," he said when the sun was peering
 over the high shoulder of a ridge; and he spoke in a hushed tone, as if he
 feared that someone might overhear him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You 'fraid Wagalexa Conka, he come?" Annie-Many-Ponies asked abruptly,
 looking at him full.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis did not understand her, so he lifted his shoulders in the Mexican
 gesture which may mean much or nothing. "Quien sabe?" he muttered vaguely
 and went on. Annie-Many-Ponies did not know what he meant, but she guessed
 that he did not want to be questioned upon the subject; so she readjusted
 the shawl that had slipped from her head and went on silently, two long
 steps behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a little he turned from the ravine, which was becoming more open and
 not quite so deep. They scrambled over boulders which the horse must
 negotiate carefully to avoid a broken leg, and then they were in another
 little ravine, walled round with rocks and high, brushy slopes. Luis went
 a little way, stopped beside a huge, jutting boulder and gave a little
 exclamation of dismay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No more here, Ramon," he said, staring down at the faintly smoking embers
 of a little fire. "She's go som' place, I don't know, me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The slim right hand of Annie-Many-Ponies went instinctively to her bosom
 and to what lay hidden there. But she waited, looking from the little
 campfire that was now almost dead, to Luis whom she suspected of
 treachery. Luis glanced up at her apologetically, caught something of
 menace in that unwinking, glittering stare, and began hastily searching
 here and there for some sign that would enlighten him further.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's here when I go, Ramon," he explained deprecatingly. "I don'
 un'stan', me. She's tell me go breeng yoh thees place. She's say I mus'
 huree w'ile dark she's las'. I'm sure s'prised, me!" Luis was a slender
 young man with a thin, patrician face that had certain picture values for
 Luck, but which greatly belied his lawless nature. Until he stood by the
 rock where she had waited for Ramon, Annie-Many-Ponies had never spoken to
 him. She did not know him, therefore she did not trust him?and she
 looked her distrust.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis turned from her after another hasty glance, and began searching for
 some sign of Ramon. Presently, in a tiny cleft near the top of the
 boulder, his black eyes spied a folded paper?two folded papers, as
 he discovered when he reached up eagerly and pulled them out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's write letter, Ramon," he cried with a certain furtive excitement.
 "Thees for yoh." And he smiled while he gave her a folded note with "Ana"
 scrawled hastily across the face of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies extended her left hand for it, and backed the few steps
 away from him which would insure her safety against a sudden attack,
 before she opened the paper and read:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Querida mia, you go with Luis. Hes all rite you trus him. He bring you
 where i am. i lov you. Ramon"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She read it twice and placed the note in her bosom?next the knife?and
 looked at Luis, the glitter gone from her eyes. She smiled a little. "I
 awful hongry," she said in her soft voice, and it was the second sentence
 she had spoken since they left the rock where she had waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis smiled back, relief showing in the uplift of his lips and the
 lightening of his eyes. "She's cache grob, Ramon," he said. "She's go som'
 place and we go also. She's wait for us. Dam-long way?tree days, I
 theenk me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You find that grub," said Annie-Many-Ponies, letting her hand drop away
 from the knife. "I awful hongry. We eat, then we go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?no go till dark comes! We walk in night?so somebody don'
 see!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies looked at him sharply, saw that he was very much in
 earnest, and turned away to gather some dry twigs for the fire. Up the
 canon a horse whinnied inquiringly, and Luis, hastening furtively that
 way, found the horse he had ridden into this place with Ramon. With the
 problem of finding provender for the two animals, he had enough to occupy
 him until Annie-Many-Ponies, from the coarse food he brought her, cooked a
 crude breakfast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Truly, this was not what she had dreamed the morning would be like?she
 who had been worried over the question of whether Ramon would let her
 confess to the priest before they were married! Here was no priest and no
 Ramon, even; but a keen-eyed young Mexican whom she scarcely knew at all;
 and a mysterious hiding-out in closed-in canons until dark before they
 might follow Ramon who loved her. Annie-Many-Ponies did not understand why
 all this stealthiness should be necessary, for she knew that proof of her
 honorable marriage would end Luck's pursuit?supposing he did pursue?even
 though his anger might live always for her. She did not understand; and
 when an Indian confronts a situation which puzzles him, you may be very
 sure that same Indian is going to be very, very cautious.
 Annie-Many-Ponies was Indian to the middle of her bone.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVII. APPLEHEAD SHOWS THE STUFF HE IS MADE OF
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lite Avery, turning to look back as they galloped up a long slope so
 gradual in its rise that it seemed almost level, counted just fourteen
 Indians spreading out fanwise in pursuit. He turned to Applehead with the
 quiet deference in his manner that had won the old man's firm friendship.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's this new move signify, boss?" he asked, tilting his head backward.
 "What they spreading out like that for, when they're outa easy rifle
 range?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead looked behind him, studied the new formation of their enemy, and
 scowled in puzzlement. He looked ahead, where he knew the land lay
 practically level before them, all sand and rabbit weed, with a little
 grass here and there; to the left, where the square butte stood up
 bold-faced and grim; to the right where a ragged sandstone ledge blocked
 the way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'S some dang new trap uh theirn," he decided, his voice signifying
 disgust for such methods. "Take an Injun 'n' he don't calc'late he's
 fightin' 'nless he's figgurin' on gittin' yuh cornered. Mebby they got
 some more cached ahead som'ers. Keep yer eye peeled, boys, 'n' shoot at
 any dang thing yuh see that yuh ain't dead sure 's a rabbit weed. Don't go
 bankin' on rocks bein' harmless?'cause every dang one's liable to
 have an Injun layin' on his belly behind it. Must be another bunch ahead
 som'ers, 'cause I know it's smooth goin' fer five miles yit. After that
 they's a drop down into a rocky kinda pocket that's hard t' git out of
 except the way yuh go in, account of there bein' one uh them dang
 rim-rocks runnin' clean 'round it. Some calls it the Devil's Fryin'-pan.
 No water ner grass ner nothin' else 'ceptin' snakes. 'N' Navvies kinda
 ownin' rattlers as bein' their breed uh cats, they don't kill 'em off, so
 they's a heap 'n' plenty of 'em in that basin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I ain't aimin' t' git caught down in there, now I'm tellin' yuh! I
 aim t' keep along clost t' that there butte, 'n' out on the other side
 where we kin pick up luck's trail. I shore would do some rarin' around if
 that boy rode off into a mess uh trouble, 'n' I'm tellin' yuh straight!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's got some good boy at his back," Weary reminded him, loyal to his
 Flying U comrade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're dang right he has! I ain't sayin' he ain't, am I? Throw some more
 lead back at them skunks behind us, will ye, Lite? 'N' the rest of yuh
 save yore shells fer close-ups!" He grinned a little at the incongruity of
 a motion-picture phrase in such a situation as this. "'N' don't be so dang
 skeered uh hurtin' somebody!" he adjured Lite, drawing rein a little so as
 not to forge ahead of the other. "You'll have to kill off a few anyway
 'fore you're through with 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lite aimed at the man riding in the center of the half-circle, and the
 bullet he sent that way created excitement of some sort; but whether the
 Indian was badly hit, or only missed by a narrow margin, the four did not
 wait to discover. They had held their horses down to a pace that merely
 kept them well ahead of the Indians; and though the horses were sweating,
 they were holding their own easily enough?with a reserve fund of
 speed if their riders needed to call upon it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead, glancing often behind him, scowled over the puzzle of that
 fanlike formation of riders. They would hardly begin so soon to herd him
 and his men into that evil little rock basin with the sinister name, and
 there was no other reason he could think of which would justify those
 tactics, unless another party waited ahead of them. He squinted ahead
 uneasily, but the mesa lay parched and empty under the sky?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then, peering straight into the glare of the sun, he saw, down the
 slope which they had climbed without realizing that it would have a crest,
 it was so low?Applehead saw the answer to the puzzle; saw and gave
 his funny little grunt of astonishment and dismay. Straight as a chalk
 line from the sandstone ledge on their right to the straight-walled butte
 on their left stretched that boundary line between the untamed wilderness
 and the tamed?a barbed wire fence; a four-wire fence at that, with
 stout cedar posts whereon the wire was stretched taut and true. From the
 look of the posts, it was not new?four or five years old, perhaps;
 not six years, certainly, for Applehead had ridden this way six years
 before and there had been not so much as a post-hole to herald the
 harnessing of the mesa.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here, then, was the explanation of the fanlike spreading out of the line
 of Indians. They knew that the white men would be trapped by the fence,
 and they were cutting off the retreat?and keeping out of the hottest
 danger-zone of the white men's guns. Even while the four were grasping the
 full significance of the trap that they had ridden into unaware, the
 Indians topped the ridge behind them, yip-yip-yipping gleefully their
 coyotelike yells of triumph. The sound so stirred the slow wrath of Lite
 Avery that, without waiting for the word from Applehead he twisted half
 around in his saddle, glanced at the nearest Indian along his
 rifle-sights, bent his forefinger with swift deliberation upon the
 trigger, and emptied the saddle of one yelling renegade, who made haste to
 crawl behind a clump of rabbit weed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They howl like a mess uh coyotes," Lite observed in justification of the
 shot, "and I'm getting sick of hearing 'em."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mama!" Weary, exclaimed annoyedly, "that darn fence is on an up-slope, so
 it's going to be next to impossible to jump it! I guess here's where we do
 about an eight-hundred-foot scene of Indian Warfare, or Fighting For Their
 Lives. How yuh feel, Cadwalloper?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me?" Pink's eyes were purple with sheer, fighting rage. "I feel like
 cleaning out that bunch back there. They'll have something to howl about
 when I get through!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stay back uh me, boys!" Applehead's voice had a masterful sharpness that
 made the three tighten reins involuntarily. "You foller me and don't crowd
 up on me, neither. Send back a shot or two if them Injuns gits too
 ambitious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The three fell in behind him without cavil or question. He was in charge
 of the outfit, and that settled it. Pink, released from irksome inaction
 by the permission to shoot, turned and fired back at the first Indian his
 sights rested upon. He saw a spurt of sand ten jumps in advance of his
 target, and he swore and fired again without waiting to steady his aim.
 The sorrel pack-horse, loping along fifty yards or so behind with a
 rhythmic clump-clump of frying-pan against coffee-pot at every leap he
 took, swerved sharply, shook his head as though a bee had stung him, and
 came on with a few stiff-legged "crow hops" to register his violent
 objection to being shot through the ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink, with an increased respect for the shooting skill of Lite Avery,
 glanced guiltily at the others to see if they had observed where his
 second bullet hit. But the others were eyeing Applehead uneasily and paid
 no attention to Pink or his attempts to hit an Indian on the run. And
 presently Pink forgot it also while he watched Applehead, who was
 apparently determined to commit suicide in a violently original form.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You fellers keep behind, now?-and hold the Injuns back fer a minute
 er two," Applehead yelled while he set himself squarely in the saddle,
 gathered up his reins as though he were about to "top a bronk" and jabbed
 the spurs with a sudden savageness into Johnny's flanks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "GIT outa here!" he yelled, and Johnny with an astonished lunge, "got."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Straight toward the fence they raced, Johnny with his ears laid back tight
 against his skull and his nose pointed straight out before him, with old
 Applehead leaning forward and yelling to Johnny with a cracked hoarseness
 that alone betrayed how far youth was behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They thought at first that he meant to jump the fence, and they knew he
 could not make it. When they saw that he meant to ride through it, Weary
 and Pink groaned involuntarily at the certainty of a fall and sickening
 entanglement in the wires. Only Lite, cool as though he were rounding up
 milch cows, rode half-turned in the saddle and sent shot after shot back
 at the line of Navajos, with such swift precision that the Indians swerved
 and fell back a little, leaving another pony wallowing in the sand and
 taking with them one fellow who limped until he had climbed up behind one
 who waited for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go it, Johnny?dang yore measly hide, go to it! We'll show 'm we
 ain't so old 'n' tender we cain't turn a trick t'bug their dang eyes out?
 Bust into it! WE'LL show 'em!?" And Applehead shrilled a raucous
 range "HOO-EEE-EE!" as Johnny lunged against the taut wires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a long chance he took?a "dang long chance" as Applehead
 admitted afterward. But, as he had hoped, it happened that Johnny's stride
 brought him with a forward leap against the wires, so that the full impact
 of his eleven-hundred pounds plus the momentum of his speed, plus the
 weight of Applehead and the saddle, hit the wires fair and full. They
 popped like cut wires on a bale of hay?and it was lucky that they
 were tight strung so that there was no slack to take some of the force
 away. It was not luck, but plain shrewdness on Applehead's part, that
 Johnny came straight on, so that there was no tearing see-saw of the
 strands as they broke. Two inch-long cuts on his chest and a deeper,
 longer one on his foreleg was the price Johnny paid, and that was all. The
 lower wire he never touched, since it was a leap that landed him against
 the fence. He lurched and recovered himself, and went on at a slower
 gallop while Applehead beckoned the three to come on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I kain't say I'd want to git in the habit uh bustin' fences that way," he
 grinned over his shoulder as the three jumped through the gap he had made
 and forged up to him. "But I calc'late if they's another one Johnny n' me
 kin make it, mebby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I was brought up in a barbed wire country," Pink exploded, "but
 I'll be darned if I ever saw a stunt like that pulled off before!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, I hed a bronk go hog-wild 'n' pop three wires on a fence one
 time," Applehead explained modestly, "'n' he didn't cut hisself a-tall,
 skurcely. It's all accordin' t' how yuh hit it, I reckon. Anyway, I
 calc'lated it was wuth tryin', 'cause we shore woulda had our hands full
 if we'd a stopped at that fence, now I'm tellin' yuh! 'N' another thing,"
 he added bodefully, "I figgured we'd better be gittin' to Luck In' his
 bunch. I calc'late they need us, mebby."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No one made any reply to that statement, but even Lite, who never had been
 inclined to laugh at him, looked at Applehead with a new respect. The
 Indians, having scurried back out of range of Lite's uncomfortably close
 shooting, yelled a bedlam of yips and howls and came on again in a closer
 group than before, shooting as they rode?at the four men first, and
 then at the hindmost pack-horse that gave a hop over the wire left across
 the gap, and came galloping heavily after the others. They succeeded in
 burying a bullet in the packed bedding, but that was all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Three hundred yards or so in the lead, the four raced down the long,
 gentle slope. A mile or two, perhaps three, they could run before their
 horses gave out. But then, when they could run no longer, they would have
 to stop and fight; and the question that harped continually through their
 minds was: Could they run until they reached Luck and the boys with him?
 Could they? They did not even know where Luck was, or what particular
 angle of direction would carry them to him quickest. Applehead and Johnny
 were pointing the way, keeping a length ahead of the others. But even old
 Applehead was riding, as he would have put it, "by-guess and by-gosh"
 until they crossed a shallow draw, labored up the hill beyond, and heard,
 straight away before them, the faint pop-pop of rifle shots. Old Applehead
 turned and sent them a blazing blue glance over his shoulders.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "RIDE, dang ye!" he barked. "They've got Luck cornered in the Devil's
 Fryin'-pan!"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVIII. IN THE DEVIL'S FRYING-PAN
 </h2>
 <p>
 Luck, riding confidently on the trail of the three horsemen who had taken
 to the south along the front of the square butte, believed that the turn
 of the trail around the southern end meant simply that the three who came
 this way would meet their companions on the other side, and that he,
 following after, would be certain to meet Applehead. He had hopes of the
 speedy capture of Ramon Chavez and his men, and the hope spread to the
 four who went with him, so that their spirits rose considerably. Big
 Medicine and Happy Jack even found a good deal of amusement in their
 exchange of opinions regarding old granny Applehead and his constant fear
 of the Navvies. Now and then the Native Son joined in the laugh, though
 his attention was chiefly given to the discussion Andy and Luck were
 having about Ramon and his manner of using Luck's work as an opportunity
 to rob the bank, and the probable effect it would have on the general
 standing of Luck and his company unless they managed to land the thieves
 in jail. Being half Mexican himself, the Native Son was sensitive upon the
 subject of Ramon, and almost as anxious to see Ramon in jail as was Luck
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So while Applehead and his boys were scenting danger and then finding
 themselves in the middle of it, Luck and his party rode along absorbed in
 themselves and in the ultimate goal, which was Ramon. They saw nothing
 queer about the trail they followed, and they saw no evidence of treachery
 anywhere. They rode with the rifles slung under their right thighs and
 their six-shooters at their hips, and their eyes roving casually over
 their immediate surroundings while their minds roved elsewhere?not
 because they were growing careless, but because there was absolutely
 nothing to rouse their suspicions, now that they no longer bad Applehead
 along to preach danger and keep them keyed up to expect it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They followed the tracks through a scattered grove of stunted pinons,
 circled at fault for a few minutes in the rocks beyond, and then picked up
 the trail. They were then in the narrow neck which was called the handle
 of the Devil's Frying-pan?and they would have ridden unsuspectingly
 into the very Pan itself, had not the Native Son's quick eyes caught a
 movement on the rim-rock across the bare, rock-bottomed basin. He spoke to
 luck about it, and luck levelled his field glasses and glimpsed a skulking
 form up there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hunt yourselves some shelter, boys!" he cried in the sharp tone of
 warning. "We'll make sure who's ahead before we go any farther."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They ducked behind rocks or trees and piled off their horses in a burry.
 And a scattered fusillade from the rim-rock ahead of them proved how
 urgent was their need.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For the first fifteen minutes or so they thought that they were fighting
 Ramon and his party, and their keenest emotions were built largely of
 resentment, which showed in the booming voice of Big Medicine when he said
 grimly:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'd jest about as soon pack Ramon in dead, as lead 'im in alive 'n'
 kickin', by cripes! Which is him, d'yuh reckon?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From behind a rock shield luck was studying the ledge. "They're Injuns?or
 there are Injuns in the bunch, at least," he told them after a moment.
 "See that sharp point sticking up straight ahead? I saw an Injun peeking
 around the edge?to the south. You watch for him, Andy, and let him
 have it where he lives next time be sticks his head out." He swung the
 glasses slowly, taking every inch of the rim in his field of vision. As he
 moved them be named the man he wanted to watch each place where he had
 reason to suspect that someone was hiding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The disheartening part of it was that he needed about a dozen more men
 than he had; for the rock wall which was the rim of the Frying-pan seemed
 alive with shooters who waited only for a fair target. Then the Native
 Son, crouched down between a rock and a clump of brush, turned his head to
 see what his horse was looking at, back whence they had come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look behind you, Luck," he advised with more calmness than one would
 expect of a man in his straits. "They're back in the pines, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fight 'em off?and take care that your backs don't show to those
 babies on the rim-rocks," he ordered instantly, thrusting his glasses into
 their case and snatching his rifle from its boot on the saddle. "They
 won't tackle coming across that bare hollow, even if they can get down
 into it without breaking their necks. Happy, lead your horse in here
 between these rocks where mine is. Bud, see if you can get the pack-horses
 over there outa sight among those bushes and rocks. We'll hold 'em off
 while you fix the horses?can't let ourselves be set afoot out here!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I-should-say?NOT!" Andy Green punctuated the sentence with a shot
 or two. "Say, I wish they'd quit sneaking around in those trees that way,
 so a fellow could see where to shoot!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A half hour dragged by. From the rim-rock came occasional shots, to which
 the besieged could not afford to reply, they were so fully occupied with
 holding back those who skulked among the trees. The horses, fancying
 perhaps that this was a motion-picture scene, dozed behind their
 rock-and-brush shelters and switched apathetically at buzzing flies and
 whining bullets alike. Their masters crouched behind their bowlders and
 watched catlike for some open demonstration, and fired when they had the
 slightest reason to believe that they would hit something besides scenery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miguel must have upset their plans a little," Luck deduced after a lull.
 "They set the stage for us down in that hollow, I guess. You can see what
 we'd have been up against if we had ridden ten rods farther, out away from
 these rocks and bushes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, they wouldn't dast kill a bunch uh white men!" Happy Jack protested,
 perhaps for his own comfort.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You think they wouldn't? Luck's voice was surcharged with sarcasm. What
 do you think they're trying to do, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, the gov'ment wouldn't STAND fer no such actions!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, by cripes, I hain't aimin' to give the gov'ment no job uh setting
 on my remains, investigatin' why I was killed off!" Big Medicine asserted,
 and took a shot at a distant grimy Stetson to prove he meant what he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, they'd have had a SNAP if we'd gone on, and let these fellows back
 here in the trees close up behind us!" Andy Green exclaimed suddenly, with
 a vividness of gesture that made Happy Jack try to swallow his Adam's
 apple. "By gracious, it would have been a regular rabbit-drive business.
 They could set in the shade and pick us off just as they darned pleased."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, is that there the cheerfullest thing you can think of to say?" Happy
 Jack was sweating, with something more than desert heat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, no. The cheerfullest thing I can think of right now is that Mig,
 here, don't ride with his eyes shut." He cast a hasty glance of gratitude
 toward the Native Son, who flushed under the smooth brown of his cheeks
 while he fired at a moving bush a hundred yards back in the grove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For another half hour nothing was gained or lost. The Indians fired
 desultorily, spatting bit&amp; of lead here and there among the rocks but
 hitting nobody. The Happy Family took a shot at every symptom of movement
 in the grove, and toward the rim-rock they sent a bullet now and then,
 just to assure the watchers up there that they were not forgotten, and as
 a hint that caution spelled safety.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For themselves, the boys were amply protected there on the side of the
 Frying-pan where the handle stretched out into the open land toward the
 mountain. Perhaps here was once a torrent flowing from the basin-like
 hollow walled round with rock; at any rate, great bowlders were scattered
 all along the rim as though spewed from the basin by some mighty force of
 the bygone ages. The soil, as so often happens in the West, was fertile to
 the very edge of the Frying-pan and young pinons and bushes had taken root
 there and managed to keep themselves alive with the snow-moisture of
 winter, in spite of the scanty rainfall the rest of the year.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boys were amply protected, yes; but there was not a drop of water save
 what they had in their canteens, and there was no feed for their horses
 unless they chose to nibble tender twigs off the bushes near them and call
 that food. There was, of course, the grain in the packs, but there was
 neither time nor opportunity to get it out. If it came to a siege, luck
 and his boys were in a bad way, and they knew it. They were penned as well
 as protected there in that rocky, brushy neck. The most that they could do
 was to discourage any rush from those back in the grove; as to getting
 through that grove themselves, and out in the open, there was not one
 chance in a hundred that they could do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From the outside in to where they were entrenched was just a trifle
 easier. The Indiana in the grove were all absorbed in watching the edge of
 the Frying-pan and had their backs to the open, never thinking that white
 men would be coming that way; for had not the other party been decoyed
 around the farther end of the big butte, and did not several miles and a
 barbed-wire fence lie between?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So when Applehead and his three, coming in from the north, approached the
 grove, they did it under cover of a draw that hid them from sight. From
 the shots that were fired, Applehead guessed the truth; that Luck's bunch
 had sensed danger before they had actually ridden into the Frying-pan
 itself, and that the Navajos were trying to drive them out of the rocks,
 and were not making much of a success of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now," Applehead instructed the three when they were as close as they
 could get to the grove without being seen, "I calc'late about the best
 thing we kin do, boys, is t' spur up our hosses and ride in amongst 'em
 shooting and a-hollerin'. Mebby we kin jest natcherlay stampede 'em?but
 we've sure got t' git through In' git under cover mighty dang suddent, er
 they'll come to theirselves an' wipe us clean off'n the map?if
 they's enough of 'em. These here that's comin' along after us, they'll
 help t' swell the party, oncet they git here. I calc'late they figger 't
 we're runnin' head-on into a mess uh trouble, 'n' they don't want t'
 colleck any stray bullets?'n' that's why they've dropped back in the
 last half mile er so. Haze them pack bosses up this way, Pink, so'st they
 won't git caught up 'fore they git t' what the rest air. Best use yore
 six-guns fer this, boys?that'll leave ye one hand t' guide yore
 bosses with, and they're handier all around in close?work. Air ye
 ready? Then come on?foller me 'n' come a-whoopin'!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A-whooping they came, up out of the draw and in among the trees as though
 they had a regiment behind them. Certain crouching figures jumped, sent
 startled glances behind them and ran like partridges for cover farther on.
 Only one or two paused to send a shot at these charging fiends who seemed
 bent on riding them down and who yelled like devils turned loose from the
 pit. And before they had found safe covert on the farther fringes of the
 grove and were ready to meet the onslaught, the clamor had ceased and the
 white men had joined those others among the rocks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So now there were nine men cornered here on the edge of the Frying-pan,
 with no water for their horses and not much hope of getting out of there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Darn you, Applehead, why didn't you keep out of this mess?" Luck demanded
 with his mouth drawn down viciously at the corners and his eyes warm with
 affection and gratitude. "What possessed your fool heart to ride into this
 trap?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, dang it, we had t' ride som'ers, didn't we?" Applehead, safe
 behind a bowlder, pulled off his greasy, gray Stetson and polished his
 bald head disconcertedly. "Had a bunch uh Navvies hangin' t' our heels
 like tumbleweed?'n' we been doin' some RIDIN', now, I'm a tellin'
 ye! 'F Lite, here, hadn't kep' droppin' one now an' then fur the rest t'
 devour, I calc'late we'd bin et up, a mile er two back!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lite looked up from shoving more cartridges into his rifle-magazine. "If
 we hadn't had a real, simon-pure go-getter to boss the job," he drawled,
 "I reckon all the shooting I did wouldn't have cut any ice. Ain't that
 right, boys?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pink, resting his rifle in a niche of the boulder and moving it here and
 there trying to fix his sights on a certain green sweater back in the
 woods that he had glimpsed a minute before, nodded assent. "You're durn
 tootin' it's right!" he testified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Weary looked shining-eyed at Applehead's purple face. "Sure, that's
 right!" he emphasized. "And I don't care how much of a trap you call this,
 it isn't a patching to the one Applehead busted us out of. He's what I
 call a Real One, boys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, shet yore dang head 'n' git yore rifles workin'!" Applehead blurted.
 "This yere ain't no time fer kiddin', 'n' I'm tellin' yuh straight. What's
 them fellers acrost the Fryin'-pan think they're tryin' t' do? luck le's
 you'n me make a few remarks over that way, 'n' leave the boys t' do some
 gun-talk with these here babies behind us. Dang it, if I knowed of a
 better place 'n' what this is fer holdin' 'em off, I'd say make a run fer
 it. But I don't 'n' that's fact. Yuh musta sprung the trap 'fore yuh got
 inside, 'cause they shore aimed t' occupy this nest uh rocks theirselves,
 with you fellers down there in the Fryin'-pan where they could git at yuh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thar's one of 'em up on the rim-rock?see 'im??standin' thar,
 by granny, like he was darin' somebody t' cut loose! Here, Lite, you spill
 some lead up thar. We'll learn 'im t' act up smart?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hey, hold on!" Luck grabbed Lite's arm as he was raising his rifle for a
 close shot at the fellow. "Don't shoot! Don't you see? Thaf's the
 peace-sign he's making!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now, dang it, he better be makin' peace-signs!" growled Applehead
 querulously, and sat down heavily on a shelf of the rock. "'Cause Lite,
 here, shore woulda tuk an ear off'n him in another minute, now I'm tellin'
 ye!"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIX. PEACE TALK
 </h2>
 <p>
 Across the Frying-pan an Indian stood boldly out upon a jutting point of
 rock and raised a hand in the sweeping upward motion of the peace-sign.
 The questing bullets that came seeking for bone and flesh among the rocks
 and bushes came no more when the signal was passed from those who saw to
 those farther back who could not see the figure silhouetted against the
 brilliant blue of the sky. A moment he stood, made the sign again, and
 waited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's peace-sign, sure as you're born!" Luck cried breathlessly, and
 went scrambling through the bushes to where he might stand in the open, on
 the very rim of the basin. Applehead yelled to him to come back and not
 make a dang fool of himself, but luck gave no heed to the warning. He
 stood out in the blazing sunshine and gave the peace-sign in reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the-rim rock the Indian stood motionless while he might have taken
 three or four breaths. Then with his hand he gave the sign for "pow-wow"
 and waited again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck, his pulse thrilling at the once familiar gesture which his tribal
 "father," old chief Big Turkey, used to give when he came stalking up for
 his daily confab with his adopted son, gave back the sign with a hand that
 trembled noticeably. Whereupon the Indian on the farther rim turned and
 began dignifiedly to climb through a rift in the ledge down into the
 Frying-pan.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He wants a pow-wow," Luck called back to the bunch. "You fellows stay
 where you're at I'm going out there in the middle and talk to him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Luck, don't let 'em make a dang monkey outa ye," Applehead protested
 anxiously. "Injuns is tricky?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's all right. You can keep a couple of rifles sighted on that old
 chief?that's what he is, I take it, from his actions and his talking
 'sign' and then if they pot me, you can pot him. But they won't. I know
 Injuns better than you do, Applehead. He just wants to talk things over?and
 I'm certainly willing that he should!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Lite, you keep your sights lined up on that Injun, then. 'N' if
 they's a crooked move made towards Luck, you cut loose?'n' say! You
 shoot to kill, this time!" He shook his finger in Lite's face
 admonishingly. "'S all right t' nip "em here 'n' take a hunk out there
 jest t' kinda take their minds off'n us?-'s all right enough so fur,
 'n' I ain't kickin' none 'cause yuh ain't killed off yuh hit. But if this
 here's a trick t' git Luck, you KILL that Injun. 'N' if you don't do it
 I'll go out there m'self 'n' choke the dang skunk t' death!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll kill him?don't worry about that," Lite promised?and the
 look in his eyes told them that the Indian was doomed at the first sign of
 treachery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You fellers wanta keep an eye peeled fer them in the grove," Applehead
 warned. "We ain't goin' t' give 'em no chanst t' sneak up 'n' skulp us
 whilst we're watchin' Luck 'n' his dang-fool pow-wowin' out there in the
 middle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, gwan! They wouldn't DAST skelp white folks!" There was a wail in the
 voice of Happy Jack.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They dast if they git the chanst," Applehead retorted fretfully. "'N' if
 you don't wanta loose that there red mop uh yourn ye better keep yer eyes
 open, now I'm tellin' yuh!" He refilled his rifle magazine and took up his
 station beside Lite Avery where he could watch the Frying-pan through the
 bushes without exposing himself to a treacherous shot from the rim-rock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the foot of the sandstone ledge the Indian stood with his bright red
 blanket wrapped around him watching Luck. On his own side Luck stood just
 clear of the rock huddle and watched the Indian. Presently he of the red
 blanket lifted his hand in the gesture of peace, and started deliberately
 out across the bare little basin. From his own side, Luck, returning again
 the gesture, went out to meet him. In the center they met, and eyed each
 other frankly. Still eyeing Luck, the old Indian put out his hand Indian
 fashion, and Luck grave it one downward shake and let go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?" he grunted; and in the Indian custom of preparing for a leisurely
 pow-wow as he had been taught by the Sioux, he squatted upon his boot
 heels and reached for his cigarette papers and tobacco.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?" replied the Navajo, a flicker of interest in his eyes at these
 little Indian touches in Luck's manner, and sat himself down cross-legged
 on the hot sand. Luck rolled a cigarette and passed the "makings" to the
 other, who received it gravely and proceeded to help himself. Luck
 scratched a match on a stone that lay beside him, lighted the Indian's
 cigarette and then his own, took four puffs and blew the smoke upward,
 watching it spread and drift away, and made the gesture that meant "Our
 pow-wow will be good," as he had seen the Sioux medicine men do before a
 council. Afterwards he began placidly to smoke and meditate.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 From his manner you would never have guessed that his life and the lives
 of the Happy Family hung upon the outcome of this meeting. You would not
 have surmised that his stomach was gnawing at his nerves, sending out
 insistently the call for food; or that his thirst tormented him; or that
 the combination of hunger, heat, thirst and mental strain had bred a
 jumping headache that was knotting the veins in his temples. All these
 nagging miseries beset him?but he knew the ways of the Indians and
 he meant to impress this old man first of all with his plains-Indian
 training; so he schooled himself to patience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian eyed him furtively from under heavy eyebrows while he smoked.
 And the sun beat savagely down upon the sand of that basin, and Luck's
 vision blurred with the pain that throbbed behind his eyes. But the facial
 discipline of the actor was his to command, and he permitted his face to
 give no sign of what he felt or thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian leaned slowly, lifted a brown hand, made a studied gesture or
 two and waited, his eyes fixed unwinkingly upon Luck. It was as if he were
 saying to himself: "We'll see if this white man can speak in the sign-talk
 of the Indians."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck lifted his two hands, drew them slowly apart to say that he had come
 a long way. Then, using only his hands?sometimes his fingers only?he
 began to talk; to tell the old Navajo that he and eight other white men
 were sheriffs and that they were chasing four white men (since he had no
 sign that meant Mexican) who had stolen money; that they had come from
 Albuquerque?and there he began to draw in the sand between them a
 crude but thoroughly understandable sketch of the trail they had taken and
 the camps they had made, and the distance they believed the four thieves
 had travelled ahead of them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He marked the camp where their horses had been stolen from them and told
 how long they had waited there until the horses of their own accord
 returned to camp; thirteen horses, he explained to the old Navajo. He drew
 a rough square to indicate the square butte, sketched the fork of the
 trail there and told how four men had turned to the north on a false
 trail, while he and four others had gone around the southern end of the
 hill. He calmly made plain that at the end of both false trails a trap had
 been laid, that Indians had fired upon white men and for no just cause.
 Why was this go? Why had Indians surrounded them back there in the grove
 and tried to kill them? Why were Indians shooting at them from the ledge
 of rocks that circled this little basin? They had no quarrel with the
 Navajos. They were chasing thieves, to take them to jail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Folded swelteringly in his red blanket the old Indian sat humped forward a
 little, smoking slowly his cigarette and studying the sketch Luck had
 drawn for him. With aching head and parched throat and hungry stomach,
 Luck sat cross-legged on the hot sand and waited, and would not let his
 face betray any emotion at all. Up on the Tim-rock brown faces peered down
 steadfastly at the pow-wow. And back among the rocks and bushes the Happy
 Family waited restively with eyes turning in all directions guarding
 against treachery; and Lite, whose bullets always went straight to the
 spot where they were aimed, stood and stared fixedly over his rifle sights
 at the red-blanketed figure squatted in the sand and kept his finger
 crooked upon the trigger. Beside him Applehead fidgeted and grumbled and
 called Luck names for being so dang slow, and wondered if those two out
 there meant to sit and chew the rag all day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian leaned and traced Luck's trail slowly with his finger. Did the
 four white men come that way? he asked in sign. And then, had Luck seen
 them? Was he sure that he was following the four who had stolen money in
 Albuquerque?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Come to think of it, Luck was not sure to the point of being able to take
 oath that it was so. He traced again where the hoofprints had been
 discovered near the stalled automobile, and signed that the six horses
 they believed to have belonged to the four who had taken two horses packed
 with food and blankets?and the stolen money.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then suddenly Luck remembered that, for proof of his story, he had a page
 of the Evening Herald in his pocket, torn from a copy he had bought on the
 streets the evening after the robbery. He pulled the folded paper out,
 spread it before the other and pointed to the article that told of the
 robbery. "Call some young man of your tribe who can read," he signed. "Let
 him read and tell you if I have spoken the truth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian took the paper and looked at it curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now, unless Applehead or some other hot-head spoiled things, Luck believed
 that things would smooth down beautifully. There had been some
 misunderstanding, evidently?else the Indiana would never have
 manifested all this old-fashioned hostility.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The blanketed one showed himself a true diplomat. "Call one of your white
 men, that there may be two and two," he gestured. And he added, with the
 first words he had spoken since they met, "Hablo espanol?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Well, if he spoke Spanish, thought Luck, why the deuce hadn't he done it
 at first? But there is no fathoming the reticence of an Indian?and
 Luck, by a sudden impulse, hid his own knowledge of the language. He stood
 up and turned toward the rocks, cupped his hands around his lips and
 called for the Native Son. "And leave your rifle at home," he added as an
 afterthought and in the interests of peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Indian turned to the rim-rock, held up the fragment of newspaper and
 called for one whom he called Juan. Presently Juan's Stetson appeared
 above the ledge, and Juan himself scrambled hastily down the rift and came
 to them, grinning with his lips and showing a row of beautifully even
 teeth, and asking suspicious questions with his black eyes that shone
 through narrowed lids.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miguel, arriving just then from the opposite direction, sized him up with
 one heavy-lashed glance and nodded negligently. He had left his rifle
 behind him as he had been told, but his six-shooter hung inside the
 waistband of his trousers where he could grip it with a single drop of his
 hand. The Native Son, lazy as he looked, was not taking any chances.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old Indian explained in Navajo to the young man who eyed the two white
 men while he listened. Of the blanket-vending, depot-haunting type was
 this young man, with a ready smile and a quick eye for a bargain and a
 smattering of English learned in his youth at a mission, and a larger
 vocabulary of Mexican that lent him fluency of speech when the mood to
 talk was on him. Half of his hair was cut so that it hung even with his
 ear-lobes. At the back it was long and looped up in the way a horse's tail
 is looped in muddy weather, and tied with a grimy red ribbon wound round
 and round it. He wore a green-and-white roughneck sweater broadly striped,
 and the blue overalls that inevitably follow American civilization into
 the wild places.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'S hot day," he announced unemotionally, and took the paper which the
 red-blanketed one held out to him. His air of condescension could not hide
 the fact that behind his pride at being able to read print he was
 unhappily aware also of his limitations in the accomplishment. Along the
 scare-head Luck had indicated, his dirty forefinger moved slowly while he
 spelled out the words. "A-a-bank rob!" he read triumphantly, and repeated
 the statement in Spanish. After that he mumbled a good deal of it, the
 longer words arresting his finger while he struggled with the syllables.
 But he got the sense of it nevertheless, as Luck and Miguel knew by the
 version he gave in Spanish to the old Indian, with now and then a Navajo
 word to help out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he came to the place where Ramon Chavez and Luis Rojas were named as
 the thieves, he gave a grunt and looked up at Luck and Miguel, read in,
 their faces that these were the men they sought, and grinned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me, I know them feller," he declared unexpectedly. "Dat day I seen them
 feller. They go?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The old Indian touched him on the shoulder, and Juan turned and repeated
 the statement in Spanish. The old man's eyes went to luck understandingly,
 while he asked Juan a question in the Navajo tongue, and afterwards gave a
 command. He turned his eyes upon the Native Son and spoke in Spanish. "The
 men you want did not come this way," he said gravely. "Juan will tell."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know dat Ramon Chavez. I seen him dat day. I'm start for home, an'
 I seen Ramon Chavez an' dat Luis Rojas an' one white feller I'm don't know
 dat feller. They don't got red car. They got big, black car. They come
 outa corral?scare my horse. They go 'cross railroad. I go 'cross
 rio. One red car pass me. I go along, bimeby I pass red car in sand. Ramon
 Chavez, he don't go in dat car. I don't know them feller. Ramon Chavez he
 go 'cross railroad in big black car."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then who was it we've been trailing out this way?" Luck asked the
 question in Spanish and glanced from one brown face to the other.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The older Indian shifted his moccasined feet in the sand and looked away.
 "Indians," he said in Mexican. "You follow, Indians think you maybe take
 them away?put 'm in jail. All friends of them Indians pretty mad.
 They come fight you. I hear, I come to find out what's fighting about."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck gazed at him stupidly for a moment until the full meaning of the
 statement seeped through the ache into his brain. He heaved a great sigh
 of relief, looked at the Native Son and laughed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The joke's on us, I guess," he said. "Go, back and tell that to the boys.
 I'll be along in a minute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Juan, grinning broadly at what he considered a very good joke on the nine
 white men who had traveled all this way for nothing, went back to explain
 the mistake to his fellows on the ledge. The old Indian took it upon
 himself to disperse the Navajos in the grove, and just as suddenly as the
 trouble started it was stopped?and the Happy Family, if they had
 been at all inclined to belittle the danger of their position, were made
 to realize it when thirty or more Navajos came flocking in from all
 quarters. Many of them could?and did?talk English
 understandably, and most of them seemed inclined to appreciate the joke.
 All save those whom Lite had "nipped and nicked" in the course of their
 flight from the rock ridge to the Frying-Pan. These were inclined to be
 peevish over their hurts and to nurse them in sullen silence while Luck,
 having a rudimentary knowledge of medicine and surgery, gave them what
 firstaid treatment was possible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Applehead, having plenty of reasons for avoiding publicity, had gone into
 retirement in the shade of a clump of brush, with Lite to keep him company
 while he smoked a meditative pipe or two and studied the puzzle of Ramon's
 probable whereabouts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can't trust a Navvy," he muttered in a discreet undertone to Lite. "I've
 fit 'em b'fore now, 'n' I KNOW. 'N' you kin be dang sure they ain't fergot
 the times I've fit 'em, neither! There's bucks millin' around here that's
 jes' achin' fer a chanst at me, t' pay up fer some I've killed off when I
 was shurf 'n' b'fore. So you keep 'n' eye peeled, Lite, whilst I think out
 this yere dang move uh Ramon's. 'N' if you see anybody sneakin' up on me,
 you GIT him. I cain't watch Navvyies 'n' mill things over in m' haid at
 the same time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lite grinned and wriggled over so that his back was against a rock. He
 laid his six-shooter Ostentatiously across his lap and got out his tobacco
 and papers. "Go ahead and think, Applehead," he consented placidly. "I'll
 guard your scalp-lock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Speaking literally, Applehead had no scalplock to guard. But he did have a
 shrewd understanding of the mole-like workings of the criminal mind; and
 with his own mind free to work on the problem, he presently declared that
 he would bet he could land Ramon Chavez in jail within a week, and sent
 Lite after Luck.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got it figgered out," he announced when Luck came over to his
 retreat. "If Ramon crossed the railroad he was aimin' t' hit out across
 the mesa to the mountains 'n' beyond. He wouldn't go south, 'cause he
 could be traced among the Injun pueblos?they's a thousand eyes down,
 that way b'fore he'd git t' wild country. He'd keep away from the valley
 country?er I would, if I was him. I know dang well whar I'D hit fer
 if I was makin' a gitaway 'n' didn't come off over here?'n' I shore
 would keep outa Navvy country, now I'm tellin' yuh! No, sir, I'd take out
 t'other way, through Hell Canon er Tijeras, 'n' I'd make fer the Jemes
 country. That thar's plenty wild 'n' rough?'n' come t' think of it,
 the Chavez boys owns quite a big grant, up in there som'ers, 'n' have got
 men in their pay up thar, runnin' their cattle. Ramon could lay low fer a
 dang long while up thar 'n' be safer'n what he would be out amongst
 strangers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'N' another thing, I'd plan t' have some hosses stached out in one uh
 them canons, 'n' I'd mebby use a autymobile t' git to 'em, 'n' send the
 car back t' town?I could trust the feller that drove it?outa
 my sight. 'N', Luck, if you'll take my advice, you'll hit out t'wards the
 Jemes country. I know every foot uh the way, 'n' we kin make it in a
 coupla days by pushin' the hosses. 'N' I'll bet every dang hoof I own 't
 we round up that bunch over thar som'ers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You lead out, then," Luck told him promptly. "I'm willing to admit you're
 better qualified to take charge of the outfit than I am. You know the
 country?and you've fit Indians."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, now, you're dang right I have! 'N' if some them bucks don't go
 off 'n' mind their own business, I'll likely fight a few morel You shoo
 'em outa camp, Luck, 'n' start 'em about their own dang business. 'N'
 we'll eat a bite 'n' git on about our own. If we show up any grub whilst
 this bunch is hangin' around we'll have t' feed 'em?'n' you know
 dang well we ain't got enough skurcely fer the Jemes trip as it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been handing out money as it is till I'm about broke," Luck
 confessed, "making presents to those fellows that came in with bullets in
 their legs and arms. Funny nobody got hit in the body?except one
 poor devil that got shot in the shoulder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We-ell, now, you kin blame Lite's dang tender heart fer that there,"
 Applehead accused, pulling at his sunbrowned mustache. "We was all comin'
 on the jump, 'n' so was the Injuns; 'n' it was purty long range 'n' nobody
 but lite could hit 'n Injun t' save his soul. 'N' Lite, he wouldn't shoot
 t' kill?he jes' kep' on nippin' an' nickin', 'n' shootin' a boss now
 an' then. I wisht I was the expert shot Lite is?I'd shore a got me a
 few Navvies back there, now I'm tellin' yuh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bud's got a bullet in his arm," Luck said, "but the bone wasn't hit, so
 he'll make out, and one of the pack-horses was shot in the ear. We got off
 mighty lucky, and I'm certainly glad Lite didn't get careless. Cost me
 about fifty dollars to square us as it is. You stay where you are,
 Applehead, till I get rid of the Indians. The old fellow acts like he
 feels he ought to stick along till we're outa here. He's kind of taken a
 notion to me because I can talk sign, and he seems to want to make sure we
 don't mix it again with the tribe. Some of them are kinda peeved, all
 right. You've got no quarrel with this old fellow, have you? He's a
 big-league medicine man in the tribe, and his Spanish name is Mariano
 Pablo Montoya. Know him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No I don't, 'n' I don't keer to neither," Applehead retorted crossly.
 "Shoo 'em off, Luck, so's we kin eat. My belly's shore a floppin' agin m'
 backbone, 'n' I'm tellin' yuh right!"

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XX. LUIS ROJAS TALKS
 </h2>
 <p>
 Three days of hiding by day in sequestered little groves or deep, hidden
 canons, with only Luis Rojas to bear her company?Luis Rojas whom she
 did not trust and therefore watched always from under her long straight
 lashes, with oblique glances when she seemed to be gazing straight before
 her; three nights of tramping through rough places where often the horses
 must pause and feel carefully for space to set their feet. Roads there
 were, but Luis avoided roads as though they carried the plague. When he
 must cross one he invariably turned back and brushed out their footprints?until
 he discovered that Annie-Many-Ponies was much cleverer at this than he
 was; often he smoked a cigarette while Annie covered their trail. Three
 days and three nights, and Ramon was not there where they stopped for the
 third day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We go slow," Luis explained nervously because of the look in the black,
 unreadable eyes of this straight, slim Indian girl who was so beautiful?and
 so silent. "They go muy fas', Ramon an' Beel. Poco tiempo?sure, we
 fin' dem little soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not betray by so much as a quiver of an eyelash that
 Luis had mentioned Bill unwittingly. But she hid the name away in her
 memory, and all that day she sat and pondered over the meager facts that
 had come her way, and with the needle of her suspicion she wove them
 together patiently until the pattern was almost complete.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon and Bill?what Bill, save Bill Holmes, would be with Ramon?
 Ramon and Bill Holmes?memory pictured them again by the rock in the
 moonlight, muttering in Spanish mostly, muttering mystery always. Ramon
 and Bill Holmes she remembered the sly, knowing glances between these two
 at "location" though they scarcely seemed on speaking terms. Ramon and
 Bill and this mysterious night-travelling, when there should be no trouble
 and no mystery at all beyond the house of the priest! So much trouble over
 the marriage of an Indian girl and a young Mexican cattle king?
 Annie-Many-Ponies was not so stupid as to believe that; she had seen too
 much of civilization in her wanderings with the show, and her work in
 pictures. She had seen man and maid "make marriage," in pictures and in
 reality. There should be no trouble, no mysterious following of Ramon by
 night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something evil there was, since Bill Holmes was with Ramon.
 Annie-Many-Ponies knew that it was so. Perhaps?perhaps the evil was
 against Wagalexa Conka! Perhaps?her heart forgot to beat when the
 thought stabbed her brain?perhaps they had killed Wagalexa Conka! It
 might be so, if he had suspected her flight and had followed Ramon, and
 they had fought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the thick shade of a pinon Luis slept with his face to the ground, his
 forehead pressed upon his folded arms. Annie-Many-Ponies got up silently
 and went and stood beside him, looking down at him as though she meant to
 wrest the truth from his brain. And Luis, feeling in his sleep the
 intensity of her gaze, stirred uneasily, yawned and sat up, looking about
 him bewilderedly. His glance rested on the girl, and he sprang to his feet
 and faced her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies smiled her little, tantalizing, wistfully inviting smile?the
 smile which luck bad whimsically called heart-twisting. "I awful
 lonesome," she murmured, and sat down with her back nestling comfortably
 against a grassy bank. "You talk. I not lets you sleep all time. You think
 I not good for talk to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me, I not tell w'at I'm theenk," Luis retorted with a crooning note, and
 sat down facing her. "Ramon be mad me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies looked at him, her eyes soft and heavy with that
 languorous look which will quickest befuddle the sense of a man. "You
 tell; Ramon not hear," she hinted. "Ramon, he got plenty trobles for
 thinking about." She smiled again. "Ramon plenty long ways off. He got
 Bill Holmes for talking to. You talk to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How he did it, why he did it, Luis Rojas could never explain afterwards.
 Something there was in her smile, in her voice, that bewitched him.
 Something there was that made him think she knew and approved of the thing
 Ramon had planned. He made swift, Spanish love to Annie-Many-Ponies, who
 smiled upon him but would not let him touch her hand?and so
 bewitched him the more. He made love?but also he talked. He told
 Annie-Many-Ponies all that she wished him to tell; and some things that
 she had never dreamed and that she shrank from hearing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For he told her of the gold they had stolen, and how they had made it look
 as though Luck Lindsay had planned the theft. He told her that he loved
 her?which did not interest her greatly?and he told her that
 Ramon would never marry her?which was like a knife thrust to her
 soul. Ramon had many loves, said Luis, and he was true to none; never
 would he marry a woman to rule his life and make him trouble?it were
 easier to make love and then laugh and ride away. Luis was "muy s'prised"
 that Annie-Many-Ponies had ever believed that Ramon would marry her,
 beautiful though she was, charming though she was, altogether irresistible
 though she was?Luis became slightly incoherent here and lapsed into
 swift rolling Spanish words which she did not understand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis, before the sun went down and it was time to eat supper and go on,
 became so thoroughly bewitched that he professed himself eager to let his
 share of the gold go, and to take Annie-Many-Ponies to a priest and marry
 her?if she wished very much to be married by a priest. In the middle
 of his exaltation, Annie-Many-Ponies chilled him with the look she gave
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You big fool," she told him bluntly. "I not so fool like that. I go to
 Ramon?and plenty gold! I think you awful fool. You make me tired!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luis was furious enough for a minute to do her violence?but
 Annie-Many-Ponies killed that impulse also with the cold contempt in her
 eyes. She was not afraid of him, and like an animal he dared not strike
 where he could not inspire fear. He muttered a Mexican oath or two and
 went mortifiedly away to lead the horses down to the little stream where
 they might drink. The girl was right?he was a fool, he told himself
 angrily; and sulked for hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Fool or not, he had told Annie-Many-Ponies what she wanted to know. He had
 given food to her brooding thoughts?food that revived swiftly and
 nourished certain traits lying dormant in her nature, buried alive under
 the veneer of white man's civilization?as we are proud to call it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The two ate in silence, and in silence they saddled the horses and fared
 forth again in their quest of Ramon?who had the gold which
 Annie-Many-Ponies boldly asserted was an added lure. "The monee?always
 the man wins that has muchos monee." Luis muttered often to himself as he
 rode into the dusk. Behind him Annie-Many-Ponies walked and led the black
 horse that bore all her worldly possessions bound to the saddle. The
 little black dog padded patiently along at his heels.

 CHAPTER XXI. "WAGALEXA CONKA?COLA!"
 </h2>
 <p>
 "So good little girl yoh are to true' Ramon! Now I knows for sure yoh lov'
 me moch as I lov' yoh! Now we go little ride more to my house high up in
 the pinons?then we be so happy like two birds in nes'. Firs' we rest
 ourselves, querida mia. This good place for res', my sweetheart that comes
 so far to be with Ramon. To-morrow we go to my house?to nes' of my
 loved one. Thees cabin, she's very good little nes' ontil tomorrow?yoh
 theenk so?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies, sitting beside the doorway of the primitive little log
 cabin where the night-journeys with Luis had ended, looked up into Ramon's
 flushed face with her slow smile. But her eyes were two deep, black wells
 whose depths he could not fathom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where them priest you promise?" she asked, her voice lowered to its
 softest Indian tone. "Now I think we make plenty marriage; then we go for
 live in your house."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon turned and caught her unexpectedly in his arms. "Ah, now you spik
 foolish talk. Yoh not trus' Ramon! Why yoh talk pries', pries' all time?
 Lov', she's plenty pries' for us. Pries' she don' make us more lov' each
 other?pries' don' make us happy?we like birds that make nes'
 in tree-tops. Yoh think they mus' have pries' for help them be happy? Lov'?that's
 plenty for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies drew herself away from his embrace, but she did it
 gently. Bill Holmes, coming up from the spring, furnished excuse enough,
 and Ramon let her go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You promise me priest for making us marriage," she persisted in her soft
 voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon twisted the points of his black mustache and regarded her askance,
 smiling crookedly. "Yoh 'fraid for trus' me, that's why I promise," he
 said at last. "Me, I don' need padre to mumble-mumble foolish words before
 I can be happy. Yoh 'fraid of Luck Leen'sey, that's why I promise. Now yoh
 come way up here, so luck don' matter no more. Yoh be happy weeth me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You promise," Annie-Many-Ponies repeated, a sullen note creeping into her
 voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bill Holmes, lounging up to the doorway, glanced from one to the other and
 laughed. "What's the matter, Ramon?" he bantered. "Can't you square it
 with your squaw? Go after her with a club, why don't you? That's what
 they're used to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon did not make any reply whatever, and Bill gave another chuckling
 laugh and joined Luis, who was going to take the gaunt horses to a tiny
 meadow beyond the hill. As he went he said something that made Luis look
 back over his shoulder and laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies lifted her head and stared straight at Ramon. He did not
 meet her eyes, nor did he show any resentment of Bill Holmes' speech; yet
 he had sworn that he loved her, that he would be proud to have her for his
 wife. She, the daughter of a chief, had been insulted in his presence, and
 he had made no protest, shown no indignation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You promise priest for making us marriage," she reiterated coldly, as if
 she meant to force his real self into the open. "You promise you put ring
 of gold for wedding on my finger, like white woman's got."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon's laugh was not pleasant. "Yoh theenk marry squaw?" he sneered.
 "Luck Leen'sey, he don't marry yoh. Why yoh theenk I marry yoh? You be
 good, Ramon lov' yoh. Buy yoh lots pretty theengs, me treat yoh fine. Yoh
 lucky girl, yoh bet. Yoh don't be foolish no more. Yoh run away, be my
 womans. W'at yoh theenk? Go back, perhaps? Yoh theenk Luck Leen'sey take
 yoh back? You gone off with Ramon Chavez, he say; yoh stay weeth Ramon
 then. Yoh Ramon's woman now. Yoh not be foolish like yoh too good for be
 kees. Luck, be kees yoh many times, I bet! Yoh don' play good girl no more
 for Ramon?oh-h, no! That joke she's w'at yoh call ches'nut. We don'
 want no more soch foolish talk, or else maybe I do w'at Bill Holmes says
 she's good for squaw!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You awful big liar," Annie-Many-Ponies stated with a calm, terrific
 frankness. "You plenty big thief. You fool me plenty?now I don't be
 fool no more. You so mean yoh think all mens like you. You think all girls
 bad girls. You awful big fool, you think I stay for you. I go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon twisted his mustache and laughed at her. "Now yoh so pretty, when
 yoh mad," he teased. "How yoh go? All yoh theengs in cabin?monee,
 clothes, grob?how yoh go? Yoh mad now?pretty soon Ramon he
 makes yoh glad! Shame for soch cross words?soch cross looks! Now I
 don't talk till yoh be good girl, and says yoh lov' Ramon. I don't let yoh
 go, neither. Yoh don't get far way?I promise yoh for true. I breeng
 yoh back, sweetheart, I promise I breeng yoh back I Yoh don't want to go
 no more w'en I'm through weeth yoh?I promise yoh! Yoh theenk I let
 yoh go? O-oh-h, no! Ramon not let yoh get far away!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In her heart she knew that he spoke at last the truth; that this was the
 real Ramon whom she had never before seen. To every woman must come
 sometime the bitter awakening from her dreamworld to the real world in all
 its sordidness and selfishness. Annie-Many-Ponies, standing there looking
 at Ramon?Ramon who laughed at her goodness?knew now what the
 future that had lain behind the mountains held in store for her. Not
 happiness, surely; not the wide ring of gold that would say she was
 Ramon's wife. Luis was right. He had spoken the truth, though she had
 believed that he lied when he said Ramon would never marry a woman. He
 would love and laugh and ride away, Luis had told her. Well, then?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shunka Chistala!" she called softly to the little black dog, that came
 eagerly, wagging his burr-matted tail. She laid her hand on its head when
 the dog jumped up to greet her. She smiled faintly while she fondled its
 silky, flapping ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why you all time pat that dam-dog?" Ramon flashed out jealously. "You
 don't pet yoh man what lov' yoh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dogs don't lie," said Annie-Many-Ponies coldly, and walked away. She did
 not look back, she did not hurry, though she must have known that Ramon in
 one bound could have stopped her with his man's strength. Her head was
 high, her shoulders were straight, her eyes were so black the pupils did
 not show at all, and a film of inscrutability veiled what bitter thoughts
 were behind them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As it had been with Luis so it was now with Ramon. Her utter disregard of
 him held him back from touching her. He stood with wrath in his eyes and
 let her go?and to hide his weakness from her strength he sent after
 her a sneering laugh and words that were like a whip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right?jus' for now I let you ron," he jeered. "Bimeby she's
 different. Bimeby I show yoh who's boss. I make yoh cry for Ramon be good
 to yoh!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not betray by so much as a glance that she beard
 him. But had he seen her face he would have been startled at the look his
 words brought there. He would have been startled and perhaps he would have
 been warned. For never bad she carried so clearly the fighting look of her
 forefathers who went out to battle. With the little black dog at her heels
 she climbed a small, round-topped hill that had a single pine like a
 cockade growing from the top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For ten minutes she stood there on the top and stared away to the
 southeast, whence she had come to keep her promise to Ramon. Never, it
 seemed to her, had a girl been so alone. In all the world there could not
 be a soul so bitter. Liar?thief?betrayer of women?and
 she had left the clean, steadfast friendship of her brother Wagalexa Conka
 for such human vermin as Ramon Chavez! She sat down, and with her face
 hidden in her shawl and her slim body rocking back and forth in weird
 rhythm to her wailing, she crooned the mourning song of the Omaha. Death
 of her past, death of her place among good people, death of her
 friendship, death of hope?she sat there with her face turned toward
 the far-away, smiling mesa where she had been happy, and wailed softly to
 herself as the women of her tribe had wailed when sorrow came to them in
 the days that were gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All through the afternoon she sat there with her back to the lone pine
 tree and her face turned toward the southeast, while the little black dog
 lay at her feet and slept. From the cabin Ramon watched her, stubbornly
 waiting until she would come down to him of her own accord. She would come?of
 that he was sure. She would come if he convinced her that he would not go
 up and coax her to come. Ramon had known many girls who were given to
 sulking over what he considered their imaginary wrongs, and he was very
 sure that he knew women better than they knew themselves. She would come,
 give her time enough, and she could not fling at him then any taunt that
 he had been over-eager. Certainly she would come?she was a woman!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the shadow of the pines lengthened until they lay like long fingers
 across the earth; and still she did not come. Bill Holmes and Luis, secure
 in the knowledge that Ramon was on guard against any unlooked-for
 visitors, slept heavily on the crude bunks in the cabin. Birds began
 twittering animatedly as the beat of the day cooled and they came forth
 from their shady retreats?and still Annie-Many-Ponies sat on the
 little hilltop, within easy calling distance of the cabin, and never once
 looked down that way. Still the little black dog curled at her feet and
 slept. For all the movement these two made, they might have been of stone;
 the pine above was more unquiet than they.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Ramon, watching her while he smoked many cigarettes, became filled with a
 vague uneasiness What was she thinking? What did she mean to do? He began
 to have faint doubts of her coming down to him. He began to be aware of
 something in her nature that was unlike those other women; something more
 inflexible, more silent, something that troubled him even while he told
 himself that she was like all the rest and he would be her master.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bah! She thinks to play with me, Ramon! Then I will go up and I will show
 her?she will follow weeping at my heels?like that dog of hers
 that some day I shall kill!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got up and threw away his cigarette, glanced within and saw that Bill
 and Luis still slept, and started up the hill to where that motionless
 figure sat beneath the pine and kept her face turned from him. It would be
 better, thought Ramon, to come upon her unawares, and so he went softly
 and very slowly, placing each foot as carefully as though he were stalking
 a wild thing of the woods.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies did not hear him coming. All her heart was yearning
 toward that far away mesa. "Wagalexa Conka?cola!" she whispered, for
 "cola" is the Sioux word for friend. Aloud she dared not speak the word,
 lest some tricksy breeze carry it to him and fill him with; anger because
 she had betrayed his friendship. "Wagalexa Conka?cola! cola!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Friendship that was dead?but she yearned for it the more. And it
 seemed to her as she whispered, that Wagalexa Conka was very, very near.
 Her heart felt his nearness, and her eyes softened. The Indian look?the
 look of her fighting forefathers?drifted slowly from her face as
 fog, drifts away before the sun. He was near?perhaps he was dead and
 his spirit had come to take her spirit by the hand and call her cola?friend.
 If that were so, then she wished that her spirit might go with his spirit,
 up through all that limitless blue, away and away and away, and never
 stop, and never tire and never feel anything but friendship like warm,
 bright sunshine!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down at the cabin a sound?a cry, a shout?startled her. She
 brushed her hand across her eyes and looked down. There, surrounding the
 cabin, were the Happy Family, and old Applehead whom she hated because he
 hated her. And in their midst stood Bill Holmes and Luis, and the setting
 sun shone on something bright?like great silver rings?that
 clasped their wrists.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Coming up the hill toward her was Wagalexa Conka, climbing swiftly,
 looking up as he came. Annie-Many-Ponies sprang to her feet, startling the
 little black dog that gave a yelp of astonishment. Came he in peace? She
 hesitated, watching him unwinkingly. Something swelled in her chest until
 she could hardly breathe, and then fluttered there like a prisoned bird.
 "COLA!" she gasped, just under her breath, and raised her hand in the
 outward, sweeping gesture that spoke peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You theenk to fix trap, you?!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She whirled and faced Ramon, whose eyes blazed bate and murder and whose
 tongue spoke the foulness of his soul. He flung out his arm fiercely and
 thrust her aside. "Me, I kill that dam?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not say any more, and the six-shooter he had levelled at Luck
 dropped from his nerveless hand like a coiled adder, Annie-Many-Ponies had
 struck. Like an avenging spirit she pulled the knife free and held it high
 over her head, facing Luck who stared up at her from below. He thought the
 look in her eyes was fear of him and of the law, and he lifted his hand
 and gave back the peace-sign. It was for him she had killed and she should
 not be punished if he could save her. But Luck failed to read her look
 aright; it was not fear he saw, but farewell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For with her free hand she made the sign of peace and farewell?and
 then the knife descended straight as a plummet to her heart. But even as
 she fell she spurned the dead Ramon with her feet, so that he rolled a
 little way while the black dog growled at him with bared teeth; even in
 death she would not touch him who had been so foul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Luck ran the last few, steep steps, and took her in his arms. His eyes
 were blurred so that he could not see her face, and his voice shook so
 that he could scarcely form the words that brushed back death from her
 soul and brought a smile to her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Annie?little sister!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Annie-Many-Ponies raised one creeping hand, groping until her fingers
 touched his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wagalexa Conka?cola!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He took her fingers and for an instant, while she yet could feel, he laid
 them against his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we
