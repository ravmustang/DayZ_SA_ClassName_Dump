 THE
 DAY OF THE BEAST

 <h2>
 CHAPTER I
 </h2>
 <p>
 His native land! Home!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ship glided slowly up the Narrows; and from its deck Daren
 Lane saw the noble black outline of the Statue of Liberty limned
 against the clear gold of sunset. A familiar old pang in his
 breast?longing and homesickness and agony, together with
 the physical burn of gassed lungs?seemed to swell into a
 profound overwhelming emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My own?my native land!" he whispered, striving to wipe the
 dimness from his eyes. Was it only two years or twenty since he
 had left his country to go to war? A sense of strangeness dawned
 upon him. His home-coming, so ceaselessly dreamed of by night and
 longed for by day, was not going to be what his hopes had
 created. But at that moment his joy was too great to harbor
 strange misgivings. How impossible for any one to understand his
 feelings then, except perhaps the comrades who had survived the
 same ordeal!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The vessel glided on. A fresh cool spring breeze with a scent of
 land fanned Lane's hot brow. It bore tidings from home. Almost he
 thought he smelled the blossoms in the orchard, and the damp
 newly plowed earth, and the smoke from the wood fire his mother
 used to bake over. A hundred clamoring thoughts strove for
 dominance over his mind?to enter and flash by and fade. His
 sight, however, except for the blur that returned again and
 again, held fast to the entrancing and thrilling scene?the
 broad glimmering sun-track of gold in the rippling channel,
 leading his eye to the grand bulk of America's symbol of freedom,
 and to the stately expanse of the Hudson River, dotted by moving
 ferry-boats and tugs, and to the magnificent broken sky-line of
 New York City, with its huge dark structures looming and its
 thousands of windows reflecting the fire of the sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was indeed a profound and stirring moment for Daren Lane, but
 not quite full, not all-satisfying. The great city seemed to
 frown. The low line of hills in the west shone dull gray and
 cold. Where were the screaming siren whistles, the gay streaming
 flags, the boats crowded with waving people, that should have
 welcomed disabled soldiers who had fought for their country? Lane
 hoped he had long passed by bitterness, but yet something rankled
 in the unhealed wound of his heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some one put a hand in close clasp upon his arm. Then Lane heard
 the scrape of a crutch on the deck, and knew who stood beside
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Dare, old boy, does it look good to you?" asked a husky
 voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Blair, but somehow not just what I expected," replied Lane,
 turning to his comrade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Uhuh, I get you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair Maynard stood erect with the aid of a crutch. There was
 even a hint of pride in the poise of his uncovered head. And for
 once Lane saw the thin white face softening and glowing.
 Maynard's big brown eyes were full of tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Guess I left my nerve as well as my leg over there," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, it's so good to get back that we're off color," returned
 Lane. "On the level, I could scream like a madman."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd like to weep," replied the other, with a half laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's Red? He oughtn't miss this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor devil! He sneaked off from me somewhere," rejoined Maynard.
 "Red's in pretty bad shape again. The voyage has been hard on
 him. I hope he'll be well enough to get his discharge when we
 land. I'll take him home to Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Middleville!" echoed Lane, musingly. "Home!... Blair, does it
 hit you?kind of queer? Do you long, yet dread to get home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Maynard had no reply for that query, but his look was expressive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've not heard from Helen for over a year," went on Lane, more
 as if speaking to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My God, Dare!" exclaimed his companion, with sudden fire. "Are
 you still thinking of her?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We?we are engaged," returned Lane, slowly. "At least we
 <i>were</i>. But I've had no word that she??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, your childlike faith is due for a jar," interrupted his
 comrade, with bitter scorn. "Come down to earth. You're a
 crippled soldier?coming home?and damn lucky at that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, what do you know?that I do not know? For long I've
 suspected you're wise to?to things at home. You know I
 haven't heard much in all these long months. My mother wrote but
 seldom. Lorna, my kid sister, forgot me, I guess.... Helen always
 was a poor correspondent. Dal answered my letters, but she never
 <i>told</i> me anything about home. When we first got to France I
 heard often from Margie Henderson and Mel Iden?crazy kind
 of letters?love-sick over soldiers.... But nothing for a
 long time now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At first they wrote! Ha! Ha!" burst out Maynard. "Sure, they
 wrote love-sick letters. They sent socks and cigarettes and candy
 and books. And they all wanted us to hurry back to marry them....
 Then?when the months had gone by and the novelty had worn
 off?when we went against the hell of real war?sick or
 worn out, sleepless and miserable, crippled or half demented with
 terror and dread and longing for home?then, by God, they
 quit!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, Blair?not all of them," remonstrated Lane,
 unsteadily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, old man, I'm sore, and you're about the only guy I can let
 out on," explained Maynard, heavily. "One thing I'm glad
 of?we'll face it together. Daren, we were kids
 together?do you remember??playing on the
 commons?straddling the old water-gates over the
 brooks?stealing cider from the country
 presses?barefoot boys going to school together. We played
 Post-Office with the girls and Indians with the boys. We made
 puppy love to Dal and Mel and Helen and Margie?all of
 them.... Then, somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth
 passed.... It seems strange and sudden now?but the war
 came. We enlisted. We had the same ideal?you and
 I.?We went to France?and you know what we did there
 together.... Now we're on this ship?getting into port of
 the good old U.S.?good as bad as she is!?going home
 together. Thank God for that. I want to be buried in Woodlawn....
 Home! Home?... We feel its meaning. But, Dare, we'll have no
 home?no place.... We are old?we are through?we
 have served?we are done.... What we dreamed of as glory
 will be cold ashes to our lips, bitter as gall.... You always
 were a dreamer, an idealist, a believer in God, truth, hope and
 womanhood. In spite of the war these somehow survive in you....
 But Dare, old friend, steel yourself now against disappointment
 and disillusion."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Used as Lane was to his comrade's outbursts, this one struck
 singularly home to Lane's heart and made him mute. The chill of
 his earlier misgiving returned, augmented by a strange
 uneasiness, a premonition of the unknown and dreadful future. But
 he threw it off. Faith would not die in Lane. It could not die
 utterly because of what he felt in himself. Yet?what was in
 store for him? Why was his hope so unquenchable? There could be
 no <i>resurgam</i> for Daren Lane. Resignation should have
 brought him peace?peace?when every nerve in his
 shell-shocked body racked him?when he could not subdue a
 mounting hope that all would be well at home?when he
 quivered at thought of mother, sister, sweetheart!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ship glided on under the shadow of America's emblem?a
 bronze woman of noble proportions, holding out a light to ships
 that came in the night?a welcome to all the world. Daren
 Lane held to his maimed comrade while they stood bare-headed and
 erect for that moment when the, ship passed the statue. Lane knew
 what Blair felt. But nothing of what that feeling was could ever
 be spoken. The deck of the ship was now crowded with passengers,
 yet they were seemingly dead to anything more than a safe arrival
 at their destination. They were not crippled American soldiers.
 Except these two there were none in service uniforms. There
 across the windy space of water loomed the many-eyed buildings,
 suggestive of the great city. A low roar of traffic came on the
 breeze. Passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before
 dark. They took no notice of the rigid, erect soldiers. Lane, arm
 in arm with Blair, face to the front, stood absorbed in his sense
 of a nameless sublimity for them while passing the Statue of
 Liberty. The spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom
 for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of Lane
 and his comrade. But it was not so much that spirit which held
 them erect, aloof, proud. It was a supreme consciousness of
 immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the
 breasts of men and women kindred to them?an unutterable and
 never-to-be-spoken glory of the duty done for others, but that
 they owed themselves. They had sustained immense loss of health
 and happiness; the future seemed like the gray, cold, gloomy
 expanse of the river; and there could never be any reward except
 this white fire of their souls. Nameless! But it was the
 increasing purpose that ran through the ages.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The ship docked at dark. Lane left Blair at the rail, gloomily
 gazing down at the confusion and bustle on the wharf, and went
 below to search for their comrade, Red Payson. He found him in
 his stateroom, half crouched on the berth, apparently oblivious
 to the important moment. It required a little effort to rouse
 Payson. He was a slight boy, not over twenty-two, sallow-faced
 and freckled, with hair that gave him the only name his comrades
 knew him by. Lane packed the boy's few possessions and talked
 vehemently all the time. Red braced up, ready to go, but he had
 little to say and that with the weary nonchalance habitual with
 him. Lane helped him up on deck, and the exertion, slight as it
 was, brought home to Lane that he needed help himself. They found
 Maynard waiting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, here we are?the Three Musketeers," said Lane, in a
 voice he tried to make cheerful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's the band?" inquired Maynard, sardonically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gay old New York?and me broke!" exclaimed Red Payson, as
 if to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the three stood by the rail, at the gangplank, waiting for
 the hurried stream of passengers to disembark. Down on the wharf
 under the glaring white lights, swarmed a crowd from which rose a
 babel of voices. A whistle blew sharply at intervals. The whirr
 and honk of taxicabs, and the jangle of trolley cars, sounded
 beyond the wide dark portal of the dock-house. The murky water
 below splashed between ship and pier. Deep voices rang out, and
 merry laughs, and shrill glad cries of welcome. The bright light
 shone down upon a motley, dark-garbed mass, moving slowly. The
 spirit of the occasion was manifest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the three disabled soldiers, the last passengers to
 disembark, slowly and laboriously descended to the wharf, no one
 offered to help them, no one waited with a smile and hand-clasp
 of welcome. No one saw them, except a burly policeman, who
 evidently had charge of the traffic at the door. He poked his
 club into the ribs of the one-legged, slowly shuffling Maynard
 and said with cheerful gruffness: "Step lively, Buddy, step
 lively!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane, with his two comrades, spent three days at a
 barracks-hospital for soldiers in Bedford Park. It was a long
 flimsy structure, bare except for rows of cots along each wall,
 and stoves at middle, and each end. The place was overcrowded
 with disabled service men, all worse off than Lane and his
 comrades. Lane felt that he really was keeping a sicker man than
 himself from what attention the hospital afforded. So he was
 glad, at the end of the third day, to find they could be
 discharged from the army.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This enforced stay, when he knew he was on his way home, had
 seemed almost unbearable to Lane. He felt that he had the
 strength to get home, and that was about all. He began to
 expectorate blood?no unusual thing for him?but this
 time to such extent that he feared the return of hemorrhage. The
 nights seemed sleepless, burning, black voids; and the days were
 hideous with noise and distraction. He wanted to think about the
 fact that he was home?an astounding and unbelievable thing.
 Once he went down to the city and walked on Broadway and Fifth
 Avenue, taxing his endurance to the limit. But he had become used
 to pain and exhaustion. So long as he could keep up he did not
 mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That day three powerful impressions were forced upon Lane, never
 to be effaced. First he found that the change in him was vast and
 incalculable and vague. He could divine but not understand.
 Secondly, the men of the service, disabled or not, were old
 stories to New Yorkers. Lane saw soldiers begging from
 pedestrians. He muttered to himself: "By God, I'll starve to
 death before I ever do that!" He could not detect any aloofness
 on the part of passers-by. They were just inattentive. Lane
 remembered with sudden shock how differently soldiers had been
 regarded two or three years ago. He had read lengthy newspaper
 accounts of the wild and magnificent welcome accorded to the
 first soldiers to return to New York. How strange the contrast!
 But that was long ago?past history?buried under the
 immense and hurried and inscrutable changes of a nation. Lane
 divined that, as he felt the mighty resistless throb of the great
 city. His third and strongest impression concerned the women he
 met and passed on the streets. Their lips and cheeks were rouged.
 Their dresses were cut too low at the neck. But even this fashion
 was not nearly so striking as the short skirts, cut off at the
 knees, and in many cases above. At first this roused a strange
 amaze in Lane. "What's the idea, I wonder?" he mused. But in the
 end it disgusted him. He reflected that for two swift years he
 had been out of the track of events, away from centers of
 population. Paris itself had held no attraction for him. Dreamer
 and brooder, he had failed to see the material things. But this
 third impression troubled him more than the other two and stirred
 thoughts he tried to dispel. Returning to the barracks he learned
 that he and his friends would be free on the morrow; and long
 into the night he rejoiced in the knowledge. Free! The grinding,
 incomprehensible Juggernaut and himself were at the parting of
 the ways. Before he went to sleep he remembered a forgotten
 prayer his mother had taught him. His ordeal was over. What had
 happened did not matter. The Hell was past and he must bury
 memory. Whether or not he had a month or a year to live it must
 be lived without memories of his ordeal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next day, at the railroad station, even at the moment of
 departure, Lane and Blair Maynard had their problem with Red
 Payson. He did not want to go to Blair's home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But hell, Red, you haven't any home?any place to go,"
 blurted out Maynard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So they argued with him, and implored him, and reasoned with him.
 Since his discharge from the hospital in France Payson had always
 been cool, weary, abstracted, difficult to reach. And here at the
 last he grew strangely aloof and stubborn. Every word that bore
 relation to his own welfare seemed only to alienate him the more.
 Lane sensed this.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See here, Red," he said, "hasn't it occurred to you that Blair
 and I need you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Need me? What!" he exclaimed, with perceptible change of tone,
 though it was incredulous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure," interposed Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Red?listen," continued Lane, speaking low and with
 difficulty. "Blair and I have been through the?the whole
 show together.... And we've been in the hospitals with you for
 months.... We've all got?sort of to rely on each other....
 Let's stick it out to the end. I guess?you know?we
 may not have a long time...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane's voice trailed off. Then the stony face of the listener
 changed for a fleeting second.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boys, I'll go over with you," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then the maimed Blair, awkward with his crutch and bag,
 insisted on helping Lane get Red aboard the train. Red could just
 about walk. Sombrely they clambered up the steps into the
 Pullman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Middleville was a prosperous and thriving inland town of twenty
 thousand inhabitants, identical with many towns of about the same
 size in the middle and eastern United States.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had been born there and had lived there all his life, seldom
 having been away up to the advent of the war. So that the
 memories of home and town and place, which he carried away from
 America with him, had never had any chance, up to the time of his
 departure, to change from the vivid, exaggerated image of
 boyhood. Since he had left Middleville he had seen great cities,
 palaces, castles, edifices, he had crossed great rivers, he had
 traveled thousands of miles, he had looked down some of the
 famous thoroughfares of the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Was this then the reason that Middleville, upon his arrival,
 seemed so strange, sordid, shrunken, so vastly changed? He
 stared, even while he helped Payson off the train?stared at
 the little brick station at once so familiar and yet so strange,
 that had held a place of dignity in the picture of his memory.
 The moment was one of shock.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he was distracted from his pondering by tearful and joyful
 cries, and deeper voices of men. He looked up to recognize
 Blair's mother, father, sister; and men and women whose faces
 appeared familiar, but whose names he could not recall. His acute
 faculty of perception took quick note of a change in Blair's
 mother. Lane turned his gaze away. The agony of joy and
 sorrow?the light of her face?was more than Lane could
 stand. He looked at the sister Margaret?a tall, fair girl.
 She had paint on her cheeks. She did not see Lane. Her strained
 gaze held a beautiful and piercing intentness. Then her eyes
 opened wide, her hand went to cover her mouth, and she cried out:
 "Oh Blair!?poor boy! Brother!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Only Lane heard her. The others were crying out themselves as
 Blair's gray-haired mother received him into her arms. She seemed
 a proud woman, broken and unsteady. Red Payson's grip on Lane's
 arm told what that scene meant to him. How pitiful the vain
 effort of Blair's people to hide their horror! Presently mother
 and sister and women relatives fell aside to let the soldier boy
 meet his father. This was something that rang the bells in Lane's
 heart. Men were different, and Blair faced his father
 differently. The wild boy had come home?the scapegoat of
 many Middleville escapades had returned?the ne'er-do-well
 sought his father's house. He had come home to die. It was there
 in Blair's white face?the dreadful truth. He wore a ribbon
 on his breast and he leaned on a crutch. For the instant, as
 father and son faced each other, there was something in Blair's
 poise, his look of an eagle, that carried home a poignant sense
 of his greatness. Lane thrilled with it and a lump constricted
 his throat. Then with Blair's ringing "Dad!" and the father's
 deep and broken: "My son! My son!" the two embraced.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a stifling moment more it seemed, attention turned on Red
 Payson, who stood nearest. Blair's folk were eager, kind,
 soft-spoken and warm in their welcome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then it came Lane's turn, and what they said or did he scarcely
 knew, until Margaret kissed him. "Oh, Dare! I'm <i>so</i> glad to
 see you home." Tears were standing in her clear blue eyes.
 "You're changed, but?not?not so much as Blair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane responded as best he could, and presently he found himself
 standing at the curb, watching the car move away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come out to-morrow," called back Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Maynard's car was carrying his comrades away. His first
 feeling was one of gladness?the next of relief. He could be
 alone now?alone to find out what had happened to him, and
 to this strange Middleville. An old negro wearing a blue uniform
 accosted Lane, shook hands with him, asked him if he had any
 baggage. "Yas sir, I sho knowed you, Mistah Dare Lane. But you
 looks powerful bad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane crossed the station platform, and the railroad yard and
 tracks, to make a short cut in the direction of his home. He
 shrank from meeting any one. He had not sent word just when he
 would arrive, though he had written his mother from New York that
 it would be soon, He was glad that no one belonging to him had
 been at the station. He wanted to see his mother in his home.
 Walking fast exhausted him, and he had to rest. How dead his legs
 felt! In fact he felt queer all over. The old burn and gnaw in
 his breast had expanded to a heavy, full, suffocating sensation.
 Yet his blood seemed to race. Suddenly an overwhelming emotion of
 rapture flooded over him. Home at last! He did not think of any
 one. He was walking across the railroad yards where as a boy he
 had been wont to steal rides on freight trains. Soon he reached
 the bridge. In the gathering twilight he halted to clutch at the
 railing and look out across where the waters met?where
 Sycamore Creek flowed into Middleville River. The roar of water
 falling over the dam came melodiously and stirringly to his ears.
 And as he looked again he was assailed by that strange sense of
 littleness, of shrunkenness, which had struck him so forcibly at
 the station. He listened to the murmur of running water. Then,
 while the sweetness of joy pervaded him, there seemed to rise
 from below or across the river or from somewhere the same strange
 misgiving, a keener dread, a chill that was not in the air, a
 fatal portent of the future. Why should this come to mock him at
 such a sacred and beautiful moment?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Passers-by stared at Lane, and some of them whispered, and one
 hesitated, as if impelled to speak. Wheeling away Lane crossed
 the bridge, turned up River Street, soon turned off again into a
 darker street, and reaching High School Park he sat down to rest
 again. He was almost spent. The park was quiet and lonely. The
 bare trees showed their skeleton outlines against the cold sky.
 It was March and the air was raw and chilly. This park that had
 once been a wonderful place now appeared so small. Everything he
 saw was familiar yet grotesque in the way it had become dwarfed.
 Across the street from where he sat lights shone in the windows
 of a house. He knew the place. Who lived there? One of the
 girls?he had forgotten which. From somewhere the
 discordance of a Victrola jarred on Lane's sensitive ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lifting his bag he proceeded on his way, halting every little
 while to catch his breath. When he turned a corner into a side
 street, recognizing every tree and gate and house, there came a
 gathering and swelling of his emotions and he began to weaken and
 shake. He was afraid he could not make it half way up the street.
 But he kept on. The torture now was more a mingled rapture and
 grief than the physical protest of his racked body. At last he
 saw the modest little house?and then he stood at the gate,
 quivering. Home! A light in the window of his old room! A
 terrible and tremendous storm of feeling forced him to lean on
 the gate. How many endless hours had the pictured memory of that
 house haunted him? There was the beloved room where he had lived
 and slept and read, and cherished over his books and over his
 compositions a secret hope and ambition to make of himself an
 author. How strange to remember that! But it was true. His day
 labor at Manton's office, for all the years since he had
 graduated from High School, had been only a means to an end. No
 one had dreamed of his dream. Then the war had come and now his
 hope, if not his faith, was dead. Never before had the
 realization been so galling, so bitter. Endlessly and eternally
 he must be concerned with himself. He had driven that habit of
 thought away a million times, but it would return. All he had
 prayed for was to get home?only to reach home
 alive?to see his mother, and his sister Lorna?and
 Helen?and then.... But he was here now and all that prayer
 was falsehood. Just to get home was not enough.. He had been
 cheated of career, love, happiness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It required extreme effort to cross the little yard, to mount the
 porch. In a moment more he would see his mother. He heard her
 within, somewhere at the back of the house. Wherefore he tip-toed
 round to the kitchen door. Here he paused, quaking. A cold sweat
 broke out all over him. Why was this return so dreadful? He
 pressed a shaking hand over his heart. How surely he knew he
 could not deceive his mother! The moment she saw him, after the
 first flash of joy, she would see the wreck of the boy she had
 let go to war. Lane choked over his emotion, but he could not
 spare her. Opening the door he entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There she stood at the stove and she looked up at the sound he
 made. Yes! but stranger than all other changes was the change in
 her. She was not the mother of his boyhood. Nor was the change
 alone age or grief or wasted cheek. The moment tore cruelly at
 Lane's heart. She did not recognize him swiftly. But when she
 did....
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh God!... Daren! My boy!" she whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother!"
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER II
 </h2>
 <p>
 His mother divined what he knew. And her embrace was so close,
 almost fierce in its tenderness, her voice so broken, that Lane
 could only hide his face over her, and shut his eyes, and shudder
 in an ecstasy. God alone had omniscience to tell what his soul
 needed, but something of it was embodied in home and mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That first acute moment past, he released her, and she clung to
 his hands, her face upturned, her eyes full of pain and joy, and
 woman's searching power, while she broke into almost incoherent
 speech; and he responded in feeling, though he caught little of
 the content of her words, and scarcely knew what he was saying.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he reeled a little and the kitchen dimmed in his sight.
 Sinking into a chair and leaning on the table he fought his
 weakness. He came close to fainting. But he held on to his sense,
 aware of his mother fluttering over him. Gradually the spell
 passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother?maybe I'm starved," he said, smiling at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That practical speech released the strain and inspired his mother
 to action. She began to bustle round the kitchen, talking all the
 while. Lane watched her and listened, and spoke occasionally.
 Once he asked about his sister Lorna, but his mother either did
 not hear or chose not to reply. All she said was music to his
 ears, yet not quite what his heart longed for. He began to
 distrust this strange longing. There was something wrong with his
 mind. His faculties seemed too sensitive. Every word his mother
 uttered was news, surprising, unusual, as if it emanated from a
 home-world that had changed. And presently she dropped into
 complaint at the hard times and the cost of everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother," he interrupted, "I didn't blow my money. I've saved
 nearly a year's pay. It's yours."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Daren, you'll need money," she protested.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not much. And maybe?I'll be strong enough to go to
 work?presently," he said, hopefully. "Do you think Manton
 will take me back?half days at first?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have my doubts, Daren," she replied, soberly. "Hattie Wilson
 has your old job. And I hear they're pleased with her. Few of the
 boys got their places back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hattie Wilson!" exclaimed Lane. "Why, she was a kid in the
 eighth grade when I left home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, my son. But that was nearly three years ago. And the
 children have sprung up like weeds. Wild weeds!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! That tousle-headed Wilson kid!" mused Lane. An uneasy
 conviction of having been forgotten dawned upon Lane. He
 remembered Blair Maynard's bitter prophecy, which he had been
 unable to accept.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anyway, Daren, are you able to work?" asked his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure," he replied, lying cheerfully, with a smile on his face.
 "Not hard work, just yet, but I can do something."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother did not share his enthusiasm. She went on preparing
 the supper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you manage to get along?" inquired Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord only knows," she replied, sombrely. "It has been very hard.
 When you left home I had only the interest on your father's life
 insurance. I sold the farm?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no!" exclaimed Lane, with a rush of boyhood memories.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I had to," she went on. "I made that money help out for a long
 time. Then I?I mortgaged this place.... Things cost so
 terribly. And Lorna had to have so much more.... But she's just
 left school and gone to work. That helps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna left school!" ejaculated Lane, incredulously. "Why,
 mother, she was only a child. Thirteen years old when I left!
 She'll miss her education. I'll send her back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, son, I doubt if you can make Lorna do anything she doesn't
 want to do," returned his mother. "She wanted to quit
 school?to earn money. Whatever she was when you left home
 she's grown up now. You'll not know her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Know Lorna! Why, mother dear, I carried Lorna's picture all
 through the war."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You won't know her," returned Mrs. Lane, positively. "My boy,
 these years so short to you have been ages here at home. You will
 find your sister?different from the little girl you left.
 You'll find all the girls you knew changed?changed. I have
 given up trying to understand what's come over the world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How?about Helen?" inquired Lane, with strange reluctance
 and shyness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen who?" asked his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen Wrapp, of course," replied Lane, quickly in his surprise.
 "The girl I was engaged to when I left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!?I had forgotten," she sighed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hasn't Helen been here to see you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let me see?well, now you tax me?I think she did come
 once?right after you left."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you?ever see her?" he asked, with slow heave of breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, now and then, as she rides by in an automobile. But she
 never sees me.... Daren, I don't know what
 your?your?that engagement means to you, but I must
 tell you?Helen Wrapp doesn't conduct herself as if she were
 engaged. Still, I don't know what's in the heads of girls to-day.
 I can only compare the present with the past."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane did not inquire further and his mother did not offer more
 comment. At the moment he heard a motor car out in front of the
 house, a girl's shrill voice in laughter, the slamming of a
 car-door?then light, quick footsteps on the porch. Lane
 could look from where he sat to the front door?only a few
 yards down the short hall. The door opened. A girl entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's Lorna," said Lane's mother. He grew aware that she bent a
 curious gaze upon his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane rose to his feet with his heart pounding, and a strange
 sense of expectancy. His little sister! Never during the endless
 months of drudgery, strife and conflict, and agony, had he
 forgotten Lorna. Not duty, nor patriotism, had forced him to
 enlist in the army before the draft. It had been an ideal which
 he imagined he shared with the millions of American boys who
 entered the service. Too deep ever to be spoken of! The barbarous
 and simian Hun, with his black record against Belgian, and French
 women, should never set foot on American soil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the lamplight Lane saw this sister throw coat and hat on the
 banister, come down the hall and enter the kitchen. She seemed
 tall, but her short skirt counteracted that effect. Her bobbed
 hair, curly and rebellious, of a rich brown-red color, framed a
 pretty face Lane surely remembered. But yet not the same! He had
 carried away memory of a child's face and this was a woman's. It
 was bright, piquant, with darkly glancing eyes, and vivid cheeks,
 and carmine lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>hot dog</i>! if it isn't Dare!" she squealed, and with
 radiant look she ran into his arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The moment, or moments, of that meeting between brother and
 sister passed, leaving Lane conscious of hearty welcome and a
 sense of unreality. He could not at once adjust his mental
 faculties to an incomprehensible difference affecting everything.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They sat down to supper, and Lane, sick, dazed, weak, found
 eating his first meal at home as different as everything else
 from what he had expected. There had been no lack of warmth or
 love in Lorna's welcome, but he suffered disappointment. Again
 for the hundredth time he put it aside and blamed his morbid
 condition. Nothing must inhibit his gladness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna gave Lane no chance to question her. She was eager,
 voluble, curious, and most disconcertingly oblivious of a
 possible sensitiveness in Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, you look like a dead one," she said. "Did you get shot,
 bayoneted, gassed, shell-shocked and all the rest? Did you go
 over the top? Did you kill any Germans? Gee! did you get to ride
 in a war-plane? Come across, now, and tell me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess about?everything happened to me?except going
 west," returned Lane. "But I don't want to talk about that. I'm
 too glad to be home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's that on your breast?" she queried, suddenly, pointing at
 the <i>Croix de Guerre</i> he wore.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That? Lorna, that's my medal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gee! Let me see." She got up and came round to peer down
 closely, to finger the decoration. "French! I never saw one
 before.... Daren, haven't you an American medal too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear sister, that's hard to say. Because I didn't deserve it,
 most likely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She leaned back to gaze more thoughtfully at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did you get this for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a long story. Some day I'll tell you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you proud of it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer he only smiled at her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's so long since the war I've forgotten so many things," she
 said, wonderingly. Then she smiled sweetly. "Dare, I'm proud of
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was a moment in which his former emotion seemed to stir for
 her. Evidently she had lost track of something once memorable.
 She was groping back for childish impressions. It was the only
 indication of softness he had felt in her. How impossible to
 believe Lorna was only fifteen! He could form no permanent
 conception of her. But in that moment he sensed something akin to
 a sister's sympathy, some vague and indefinable thought in her,
 too big for her to grasp. He never felt it again. The serious
 sweet mood vanished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog! I've a brother with the <i>Croix de Guerre</i>. I'll
 swell up over that. I'll crow over some of these Janes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thus she talked on while eating her supper. And Lane tried to eat
 while he watched her. Presently he moved his chair near to the
 stove. Lorna did not wait upon her mother. It was the mother who
 did the waiting, as silently she moved from table to stove.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna's waist was cut so low that it showed the swell of her
 breast. The red color of her cheeks, high up near her temples,
 was not altogether the rosy line of health and youth. Her
 eyebrows were only faint, thin, curved lines, oriental in effect.
 She appeared to be unusually well-developed in body for so young
 a girl. And the air of sophistication, of experience that seemed
 a part of her manner completely mystified Lane. If it had not
 been for the slangy speech, and the false color in her face, he
 would have been amused at what he might have termed his little
 sister's posing as a woman of the world. But in the light of
 these he grew doubtful of his impression. Lastly, he saw that she
 wore her stockings rolled below her knees and that the edge of
 her short skirt permitted several inches of her bare legs to be
 seen. And at that he did not know what to think. He was stunned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you served a while under Captain Thesel in the war," she
 said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I guess I did," replied Lane, with sombre memory resurging.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know he lives here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knew him here in Middleville several years before the war."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's danced with me at the Armory. Some swell dancer! He and
 Dick Swann and Hardy MacLean sometimes drop in at the Armory on
 Saturday nights. Captain Thesel is chasing Mrs. Clemhorn now.
 They're always together.... Daren, did he ever have it in for
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He never liked me. We never got along here in Middleville. And
 naturally in the service when he was a captain and I only a
 private?we didn't get along any better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I've heard Captain Thesel was to blame for?for what
 was said about you last summer when he came home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And what was that, Lorna?" queried Lane, curiously puzzled at
 her, and darkly conscious of the ill omen that had preceded him
 home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll not hear it from me," declared Lorna, spiritedly. "But
 that <i>Croix de Guerre</i> doesn't agree with it, I'll tell the
 world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A little frown puckered her smooth brow and there was a gleam in
 her eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Seems to me I heard some of the kids talking last summer," she
 mused, ponderingly. "Vane Thesel was stuck on Mel Iden and Dot
 Dalrymple both before the war. Dot handed him a lemon. He's still
 trying to rush Dot, and the gossip is he'd go after Mel even now
 on the sly, if she'd stand for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why on the sly?" inquired Lane. "Before I left home Mel Iden was
 about the prettiest and most popular girl in Middleville. Her
 people were poor, and ordinary, perhaps, but she was the equal of
 any one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thesel couldn't rush Mel now and get away with it, unless on the
 q-t," replied Lorna. "Haven't you heard about Mel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you see the fact is, my few correspondents rather neglected
 to send me news," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The significance of this was lost upon his sister. She giggled.
 "Hot dog! You've got some kicks coming, I'll say!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that so," returned Lane, with irritation. "A few more or less
 won't matter.... Lorna, do you know Helen Wrapp?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That red-headed dame!" burst out Lorna, with heat. "I should
 smile I do. She's one who doesn't shake a shimmy on tea, believe
 me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was somewhat at a loss to understand his sister's
 intimation, but as it was vulgarly inimical, and seemed to hold
 some subtle personal scorn or jealousy, he shrank from
 questioning her. This talk with his sister was the most unreal
 happening he had ever experienced. He could not adjust himself to
 its verity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen Wrapp is nutty about Dick Swann," went on Lorna. "She
 drives down to the office after??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna, do you know Helen and I are engaged?" interrupted Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog!" was that young lady's exposition of utter amaze. She
 stared at her brother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We were engaged," continued Lane. "She wore my ring. When I
 enlisted she wanted me to marry her before I left. But I wouldn't
 do that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna promptly recovered from her amaze. "Well, it's a damn lucky
 thing you didn't take her up on that marriage stuff."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a glint of dark youthful passion in Lorna's face. Lane
 felt rise in him a desire to bid her sharply to omit slang and
 profanity from the conversation. But the desire faded before his
 bewilderment. All had suffered change. What had he come home to?
 There was no clear answer. But whatever it was, he felt it to be
 enormous and staggering. And he meant to find out. Weary as was
 his mind, it grasped peculiar significances and deep portents.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna, where do you work?" he began, shifting his interest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "At Swann's," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the office?at the foundry?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Mr. Swann's at the head of the leather works."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I type letters," she answered, and rose to make him a little bow
 that held the movement and the suggestion of a dancer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You've learned stenography?" he asked, in surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm learning shorthand," replied Lorna. "You see I had only a
 few weeks in business school before Dick got me the job."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dick Swann? Do you work for him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. For the superintendent, Mr. Fryer. But I go to Dick's office
 to do letters for him some of the time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She appeared frank and nonchalant, evidently a little proud of
 her important position. She posed before Lane and pirouetted with
 fancy little steps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, Dare, won't you teach me a new dance?right from
 Paris?" she interposed. "Something that will put the shimmy and
 toddle out of biz?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna, I don't know what the shimmy and toddle are. I've only
 heard of them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Buried alive, I'll say," she retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane bit his tongue to keep back a hot reprimand. He looked at
 his mother, who was clearing off the supper table. She looked
 sad. The light had left her worn face. Lane did not feel sure of
 his ground here. So he controlled his feelings and directed his
 interest toward more news.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course Dick Swann was in the service?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. He didn't go," replied Lorna.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The information struck Lane singularly. Dick Swann had always
 been a prominent figure in the Middleville battery, in those
 seemingly long past years since before the war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't Dick go into the service? Why didn't the draft get
 him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He had poor eyesight, and his father needed him at the iron
 works."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor eyesight!" ejaculated Lane. "He was the best shot in the
 battery?the best hunter among the boys. Well, that's
 funny."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, there are people who called Dick Swann a slacker,"
 returned Lorna, as if forced to give this information. "But I
 never saw that it hurt him. He's rich now. His uncle left him a
 million, and his father will leave him another. And I'll say it's
 the money people want these days."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The materialism so pregnant in Lorna's half bitter reply checked
 Lane's further questioning. He edged closer to the stove, feeling
 a little cold. A shadow drifted across the warmth and glow of his
 mind. At home now he was to be confronted with a monstrous and
 insupportable truth?the craven cowardice of the man who had
 been eligible to service in army or navy, and who had evaded it.
 In camp and trench and dug-out he had heard of the army of
 slackers. And of all the vile and stark profanity which the war
 gave birth to on the lips of miserable and maimed soldiers, that
 flung on the slackers was the worst.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got a date to go to the movies," said Lorna, and she
 bounced out of the kitchen into the hall singing:
 </p><br>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
 <span>"Oh by heck
 <br></span> <span>You never saw a wreck
 <br></span> <span>Like the wreck she made of me."
 <br></span>
 </div>
 </div>
 <p>
 She went upstairs, while Lane sat there trying to adapt himself
 to a new and unintelligible environment. His mother began washing
 the dishes. Lane felt her gaze upon his face, and he struggled
 against all the weaknesses that beset him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, doesn't Lorna help you with the house work?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She used to. But not any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you let her go out at night to the movies?dances, and
 all that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Lane made a gesture of helplessness. "Lorna goes out all the
 time. She's never here. She stays out until midnight?one
 o'clock?later. She's popular with the boys. I couldn't stop
 her even if I wanted to. Girls can't be stopped these days. I do
 all I can for her?make her dresses?slave for
 her?hoping she'll find a good husband. But the young men
 are not marrying."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Heavens, are you already looking for a husband for Lorna?"
 broke out Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't understand, Dare. You've been away so long. Wait till
 you've seen what girls?are nowadays. Then you'll not wonder
 that I'd like to see Lorna settled."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, you're right," he said, gravely. "I've been away
 so?long. But I'm back home now. I'll soon get on to things.
 And I'll help you. I'll take Lorna in hand. I'll relieve you of a
 whole lot."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were always a good boy, Daren, to me and Lorna," murmured
 Mrs. Lane, almost in tears. "It's cheered me to get you home,
 yet.... Oh, if you were well and strong!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, mother. I'll get better," he replied, rising to take
 up his bag. "I guess now I'd better go to bed. I'm just about all
 in.... Wonder how Blair and Red are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother followed him up the narrow stairway, talking, trying
 to pretend she did not see his dragging steps, his clutch on the
 banisters.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your room's just as you left it," she said, opening the door.
 Then on the threshold she kissed him. "My son, I thank God you
 have come home alive. You give me hope in?in spite of
 all.... If you need me, call. Good night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was alone in the little room that had lived in waking and
 dreaming thought. Except to appear strangely smaller, it had not
 changed. His bed and desk?the old bureau?the few
 pictures?the bookcase he had built himself?these were
 identical with images in his memory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A sweet and wonderful emotion of peace pervaded his
 soul?fulfilment at last of the soldier's endless longing
 for home, bed, quiet, rest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I have to die?I can do it <i>now</i> without hate of
 all around me," he whispered, in the passion of his spirit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But as he sat upon his bed, trying with shaking and clumsy hands
 to undress himself, that exalted mood flashed by. Some of the
 dearest memories of his life were associated with this little
 room. Here he had dreamed; here he had read and studied; here he
 had fought out some of the poignant battles of youth. So much of
 life seemed behind him. At last he got undressed, and
 extinguishing the light, he crawled into bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The darkness was welcome, and the quiet was exquisitely soothing.
 He lay there, staring into the blackness, feeling his body sink
 slowly as if weighted. How cool and soft the touch of sheets!
 Then, the river of throbbing fire that was his blood, seemed to
 move again. And the dull ache, deep in the bones, possessed his
 nerves. In his breast there began a vibrating, as if thousands of
 tiny bubbles were being pricked to bursting in his lungs. And the
 itch to cough came back to his throat. And all his flesh seemed
 in contention with a slowly ebbing force. Sleep might come
 perhaps after pain had lulled. His heart beat unsteadily and
 weakly, sometimes with a strange little flutter. How many weary
 interminable hours had he endured! But to-night he was too far
 spent, too far gone for long wakefulness. He drifted away and
 sank as if into black oblivion where there sounded the dreadful
 roll of drums, and images moved under gray clouds, and men were
 running like phantoms. He awoke from nightmares, wet with cold
 sweat, and lay staring again at the blackness, once more alive to
 recurrent pain. Pain that was an old, old story, yet ever acute
 and insistent and merciless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The night wore on, hour by hour. The courthouse clock rang out
 one single deep mellow clang. One o'clock! Lane thrilled to the
 sound. It brought back the school days, the vacation days, the
 Indian summer days when the hills were golden and the purple haze
 hung over the land?the days that were to be no more for
 Daren Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the distance somewhere a motor-car hummed, and came closer,
 louder down the street, to slow its sound with sliding creak and
 jar outside in front of the house. Lane heard laughter and voices
 of a party of young people. Footsteps, heavy and light, came up
 the walk, and on to the porch. Lorna was returning rather late
 from the motion-picture, thought Lane, and he raised his head
 from the pillow, to lean toward the open window, listening.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come across, kiddo," said a boy's voice, husky and low.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane heard a kiss?then another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cheese it, you boob!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gee, your gettin' snippy. Say, will you ride out to Flesher's
 to-morrow night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing doing, I've got a date. Good night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hall door below opened and shut. Footsteps thumped off the
 porch and out to the street. Lane heard the giggle of girls, the
 snap of a car-door, the creaking of wheels, and then a low hum,
 dying away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna came slowly up stairs to enter her room, moving quietly.
 And Lane lay on his bed, wide-eyed, staring into the blackness.
 "My little sister," he whispered to himself. And the words that
 had meant so much seemed a mockery.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER III
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane saw the casement of his window grow gray with the glimmering
 light of dawn. After that he slept several hours. When he awoke
 it was nine o'clock. The long night with its morbid dreams and
 thoughts had passed, and in the sunshine of day he saw things
 differently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To move, to get up was not an easy task. It took stern will, and
 all the strength of muscle he had left, and when he finally
 achieved it there was a clammy dew of pain upon his face. With
 slow guarded movements he began to dress himself. Any sudden or
 violent action might burst the delicate gassed spots in his lungs
 or throw out of place one of the lower vertebrae of his spine.
 The former meant death, and the latter bent his body like a
 letter S and caused such excruciating agony that it was worse
 than death. These were his two ever-present perils. The other
 aches and pains he could endure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He shaved and put on clean things, and his best coat, and
 surveyed himself in the little mirror. He saw a thin face, white
 as marble, but he was not ashamed of it. His story was there to
 read, if any one had kind enough eyes to see. What would Helen
 think of him?and Margaret Maynard?and Dal?and
 Mel Iden? Bitter curiosity seemed his strongest feeling
 concerning his fiancee. He would hold her as engaged to him until
 she informed him she was not. As for the others, thought of them
 quickened his interest, especially in Mel. What had happened to
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was going to be wonderful to meet them?and to meet
 everybody he had once known. Wonderful because he would see what
 the war had done to them and they would see what it had done to
 him. A peculiar significance lay between his sister and
 Helen?all these girls, and the fact of his having gone to
 war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They may not think of it, but <i>I know</i>," he muttered to
 himself. And he sat down upon his bed to plan how best to meet
 them, and others. He did not know what he was going to encounter,
 but he fortified himself against calamity. Strange portent of
 this had crossed the sea to haunt him. As soon as he was sure of
 what had happened in Middleville, of the attitude people would
 have toward a crippled soldier, and of what he could do with the
 month or year that might be left him to live, then he would know
 his own mind. All he sensed now was that there had been some
 monstrous inexplicable alteration in hope, love, life. His ordeal
 of physical strife, loneliness, longing was now over, for he was
 back home. But he divined that his greater ordeal lay before him,
 here in this little house, and out there in Middleville. All the
 subtlety, intelligence, and bitter vision developed by the war
 sharpened here to confront him with terrible possibilities. Had
 his countrymen, his people, his friends, his sweetheart, all
 failed him? Was there justice in Blair Maynard's scorn? Lane's
 faith cried out in revolt. He augmented all possible catastrophe,
 and then could not believe that he had sacrificed himself in
 vain. He knew himself. In him was embodied all the potentiality
 for hope of the future. And it was with the front and stride of a
 soldier, facing the mystery, the ingratitude, the ignorance and
 hell of war, that he left his room and went down stairs to meet
 the evils in store.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother was not in the kitchen. The door stood open. He heard
 her outside talking to a neighbor woman, over the fence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "?Daren looks dreadful," his mother was saying in low
 voice. "He could hardly walk... It breaks my heart. I'm glad to
 have him along?but to see him waste away, day by day, like
 Mary Dean's boy?" she broke off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Too bad! It's a pity," replied the neighbor. "Sad?now it
 comes home to us. My son Ted came in last night and said he'd
 talked with a boy who'd seen young Maynard and the strange
 soldier who was with him. They must be worse off than
 Daren?Blair Maynard with only one leg and?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, where are you? I'm hungry," called Lane, interrupting
 that conversation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came hurriedly in, at once fearful he might have heard, and
 solicitous for his welfare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you look better in daylight?not so white," she
 said. "You sit down now, and let me get your breakfast."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane managed to eat a little this morning, which fact delighted
 his mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to see Dr. Bronson," said Lane, presently. "Then I'll
 go to Manton's, and round town a little. And if I don't tire out
 I'll call on Helen. Of course Lorna has gone to work?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh yes, she leaves at half after eight."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, I was awake last night when she got home," went on Lane,
 seriously. "It was one o'clock. She came in a car. I heard girls
 tittering. And some boy came up on the porch with Lorna and
 kissed her. Well, that might not mean much?but something
 about their talk, the way it was done?makes me pretty sick.
 Did you know this sort of thing was going on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. And I've talked with mothers who have girls Lorna's age.
 They've all run wild the last year or so. Dances and rides! Last
 summer I was worried half to death. But we mothers don't think
 the girls are really <i>bad</i>. They're just crazy for fun,
 excitement, boys. Times and pleasures have changed. The girls say
 the mothers don't understand. Maybe we don't. I try to be
 patient. I trust Lorna. I can't see through it all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't worry, mother," said Lane, patting her hand. "I'll see
 through it for you. And if Lorna is?well, running too
 much?wild as you said?I'll stop her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His mother shook her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One thing we mothers all agree on. These girls, of this
 generation, say fourteen to sixteen, <i>can't</i> be stopped."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then that is a serious matter. It must be a peculiarity of the
 day. Maybe the war left this condition."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The war changed all things, my son," replied his mother, sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane walked thoughtfully down the street toward Doctor Bronson's
 office. As long as he walked slowly he managed not to give any
 hint of his weakness. The sun was shining with steely brightness
 and the March wind was living up to its fame. He longed for
 summer and hot days in quiet woods or fields where daisies
 bloomed. Would he live to see the Indian summer days, the smoky
 haze, the purple asters?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was admitted at once into the office of Doctor Bronson, a
 little, gray, slight man with shrewd, kind eyes and a thoughtful
 brow. For years he had been a friend as well as physician to the
 Lanes, and he had always liked Daren. His surprise was great and
 his welcome warm. But a moment later he gazed at Lane with
 piercing eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here, boy, did you go to the bad over there?" he demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you mean, Doctor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you let down?debase yourself morally?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. But I went to the bad physically and spiritually."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see that. I don't like the color of your face.... Well, well,
 Daren. It was hell, wasn't it? Did you kill a couple of Huns for
 me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Questions like this latter one always alienated Lane in some
 unaccountable way. It must have been revealed in his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, Daren. I see that you <i>did</i>.... I'm glad you're
 back alive. Now what can I do for you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been discharged from three hospitals in the last two
 months?not because I was well, but because I was in better
 shape than some other poor devil. Those doctors in the service
 grew hard?they had to be hard?but they saw the worst,
 the agony of the war. I always felt sorry for them. They never
 seemed to eat or sleep or rest. They had no time to save a man.
 It was cut him up or tie him up?then on to the next....
 Now, Doc, I want you to look me over and?well?tell me
 what to expect."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right," replied Doctor Bronson, gruffly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I want you to promise not to tell mother or any one. Will
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I promise. Now come in here and get off some of your
 clothes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor, it's pretty tough on me to get in and out of my
 clothes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll help you. Now tell me what the Germans did to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane laughed grimly. "Doctor, do you remember I was in your
 Sunday School class?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I remember that. What's it got to do with Germans?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing. It struck me funny, that's all.... Well, to get it
 over. I was injured several times at the training camp."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything serious?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I guess not. Anyway I forgot about <i>them.</i> Doctor, I
 was shot four times, once clear through. I'll show you. Got a bad
 bayonet jab that doesn't seem to heal well. Then I had a dose of
 both gases?chlorine and mustard?and both all but
 killed me. Last I've a weak place in my spine. There's a vertebra
 that slips out of place occasionally. The least movement may do
 it. I <i>can't</i> guard against it. The last time it slipped out
 I was washing my teeth. I'm in mortal dread of this. For it
 twists me out of shape and hurts horribly. I'm afraid it'll give
 me paralysis."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Humph! It would. But it can be fixed.... So that's all they did
 to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Underneath the dry humor of the little doctor, Lane thought he
 detected something akin to anger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that's all they did to my body," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson, during a careful and thorough examination of
 Lane's heart, lungs, blood pressure, and abdominal region, did
 not speak once. But when he turned him over, to see and feel the
 hole in Lane's back, he exclaimed: "My God, boy, what made
 this?a shell? I can put my fist in it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's the bayonet jab."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson cursed in a most undignified and unprofessional
 manner. Then without further comment he went on and completed the
 examination.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That'll do," he said, and lent a hand while Lane put on his
 clothes. It was then he noticed Lane's medal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ha! The <i>Croix de Guerre!</i>... Daren, I was a friend of your
 father's. I <i>know</i> how that medal would have made him feel.
 Tell me what you did to get it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing much," replied Lane, stirred. "It was in the Argonne,
 when we took to open fighting. In fact I got most of my hurts
 there.... I carried a badly wounded French officer back off the
 field. He was a heavy man. That's where I injured my spine. I had
 to run with him. And worse luck, he was dead when I got him back.
 But I didn't know that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So the French decorated you, hey?" asked the doctor, leaning
 back with hands on hips, and keenly eyeing Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did not the American Army give you equal honor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, for one thing it was never reported. And besides, it
 wasn't anything any other fellow wouldn't do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson dropped his head and paced to and fro. Then the
 door-bell rang in the reception room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane," began the doctor, suddenly stopping before Lane,
 "I'd hesitate to ask most men if they wanted the truth. To many
 men I'd lie. But I know a few words from me can't faze you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Doctor, one way or another it is all the same to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, boy, I can fix up that vertebra so it won't slip out
 again.... But, if there's anything in the world to save your
 life, I don't know what it is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Doctor. It's?something to know?what to
 expect," returned Lane, with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You might live a year?and you might not.... You might
 improve. God only knows. Miracles <i>do</i> happen. Anyway, come
 back to see me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane shook hands with him and went out, passing another patient
 in the reception room. Then as Lane opened the door and stepped
 out upon the porch he almost collided with a girl who evidently
 had been about to come in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beg your??" he began, and stopped. He knew this
 girl, but the strained tragic shadow of her eyes was strikingly
 unfamiliar. The transparent white skin let the blue tracery of
 veins show. On the instant her lips trembled and parted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren?don't you know me?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel Iden!" he burst out. "Know you? I should smile I do. But
 it?it was so sudden. And you're older?different
 somehow. Mel, you're sweeter?why you're beautiful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He clasped her hands and held on to them, until he felt her
 rather nervously trying to withdraw them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren, I'm glad to see you home?alive?whole,"
 she said, almost in a whisper. "Are you?well?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Mel. I'm in pretty bad shape," he replied. "Lucky to get
 home alive?to see you all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry. You're so white. You're wonderfully changed, Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So are you. But I'll say I'm happy it's not painted face and
 plucked eyebrows.... Mel, what's happened to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She suddenly espied the decoration on his coat. The blood rose
 and stained her clear cheek. With a gesture of exquisite grace
 and sensibility that thrilled Lane she touched the medal. "Oh!
 The <i>Croix de Guerre</i>.... Daren, you were a hero."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Mel, just a soldier."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She looked up into his face with eyes that fascinated Lane, so
 beautiful were they?the blue of corn-flowers?and
 lighted then with strange rapt glow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just a soldier!" she murmured. But Lane heard in that all the
 sweetness and understanding possible for any woman's heart. She
 amazed him?held him spellbound. Here was the
 sympathy?and something else?a nameless need?for
 which he yearned. The moment was fraught with incomprehensible
 forces. Lane's sore heart responded to her rapt look, to the
 sudden strange passion of her pale face. Swiftly he divined that
 Mel Iden gloried in the presence of a maimed and proven soldier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I'll come to see you," he said, breaking the spell. "Do you
 still live out on the Hill road? I remember the four big white
 oaks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Daren, I've left home," she said, with slow change, as if
 his words recalled something she had forgotten. All the radiance
 vanished, leaving her singularly white.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Left home! What for?" he asked, bluntly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Father turned me out," she replied, with face averted. The soft
 roundness of her throat swelled. Lane saw her full breast heave
 under her coat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What're you saying, Mel Iden?" he demanded, as quickly as he
 could find his voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she turned bravely to meet his gaze, and Lane had never seen
 as sad eyes as looked into his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, haven't you heard?about me?" she asked, with
 tremulous lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. What's wrong?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I can't let you call on me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not? Are you married?jealous husband?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I'm not married?but I?I have a baby," she
 whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel!" gasped Lane. "A war baby?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was so shocked he could not collect his scattered wits, let
 alone think of the right thing to say, if there were any right
 thing. "Mel, this is a?a terrible surprise. Oh, I'm
 sorry.... How the war played hell with all of us! But for
 you?Mel Iden?I can't believe it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, so terribly true," she said. "Don't I look it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, you look?oh?heartbroken."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am broken-hearted," she replied, and drooped her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forgive me, Mel. I hardly know what I'm saying.... But
 listen?I'm coming to see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That trenchant word was thought-provoking. A glimmer of
 understanding began to dawn in Lane. Already an immense pity had
 flooded his soul, and a profound sense of the mystery and tragedy
 of Mel Iden. She had always been unusual, aloof, proud,
 unattainable, a girl with a heart of golden fire. And now she had
 a nameless child and was an outcast from her father's house. The
 fact, the fatality of it, stunned Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I must go in to see Dr. Bronson," she said. "I'm glad
 you're home. I'm proud of you. I'm happy for your mother and
 Lorna. You must watch Lorna?try to restrain her. She's
 going wrong. All the young girls are going wrong. Oh, it's a more
 dreadful time <i>now</i> than before or during the war. The
 let-down has been terrible.... Good-bye, Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In other days Manton's building on Main Street had appeared a
 pretentious one to Lane's untraveled eyes. It was an old
 three-story red-brick-front edifice, squatted between higher and
 more modern structures. When he climbed the dirty dark stairway
 up to the second floor a throng of memories returned with the
 sensations of creaky steps, musty smell, and dim light. When he
 pushed open a door on which MANTON &amp; CO. showed in black
 letters he caught his breath. Long?long past! Was it
 possible that he had been penned up for three years in this
 stifling place?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manton carried on various lines of business, and for Middleville,
 he was held to be something of a merchant and broker. Lane was
 wholly familiar with the halls, the several lettered doors, the
 large unpartitioned office at the back of the building. Here his
 slow progress was intercepted by a slip of a girl who asked him
 what he wanted. Before answering, Lane took stock of the girl.
 She might have been all of fifteen?no older. She had curly
 bobbed hair, and a face that would have been comely but for the
 powder and rouge. She was chewing gum, and she ogled Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I want to see Mr. Manton," Lane said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What name, please."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She tripped off toward the door leading to Manton's private
 offices, and Lane's gaze, curiously following her, found her
 costume to be startling even to his expectant eyes. Then she
 disappeared. Lane's gaze sought the corner and desk that once
 upon a time had been his. A blond young lady, also with bobbed
 hair, was operating a typewriter at his desk. She glanced up, and
 espying Lane, she suddenly stopped her work. She recognized him.
 But, if she were Hattie Wilson, it was certain that Lane did not
 recognize her. Then the office girl returned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Step this way, please. Mr. Smith will see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How singularly it struck Lane that not once in three years had he
 thought of Smith. But when he saw him, the intervening months
 were as nothing. Lean, spare, pallid, with baggy eyes, and the
 nose of a drinker, Smith had not changed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do, Lane. So you're back? Welcome to our city," he said,
 extending a nerveless hand that felt to Lane like a dead fish.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Mr. Smith. Yes, I'm back," returned Lane, taking the
 chair Smith indicated. And then he met the inevitable questions
 as best he could in order not to appear curt or uncivil.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd like to see Mr. Manton to ask for my old job," interposed
 Lane, presently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's busy now, Lane, but maybe he'll see you. I'll find out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Smith got up and went out. Lane sat there with a vague sense of
 absurdity in the situation. The click of a typewriter sounded
 from behind him. He wanted to hurry out. He wanted to think of
 other things, and twice he drove away memory of the girl he had
 just left at Doctor Bronson's office. Presently Smith returned,
 slipping along in his shiny black suit, flat-footed and slightly
 bowed, with his set dull expression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, Mr. Manton asks you to please excuse him. He's extremely
 busy," said Smith. "I told him that you wanted your old job back.
 And he instructed me to tell you he had been put to the trouble
 of breaking in a girl to take your place. She now does the work
 you used to have?very satisfactorily, Mr. Manton thinks,
 and at less pay. So, of course, a change is impossible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see," returned Lane, slowly, as he rose to go. "I had an idea
 that might be the case. I'm finding things?a little
 different."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No doubt, Lane. You fellows who went away left us to make the
 best of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Smith, we fellows 'went away,'" replied Lane, with satire,
 "and I'm finding out the fact wasn't greatly appreciated. Good
 day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On the way out the little office girl opened the door for him and
 ogled him again, and stood a moment on the threshold.
 Ponderingly, Lane made his way down to the street. A rush of cool
 spring air seemed to refresh him, and with it came a realization
 that he never would have been able to stay cooped up in Manton's
 place. Even if his services had been greatly desired he could not
 have given them for long. He could not have stood that place.
 This was a new phase of his mental condition. Work almost
 anywhere in Middleville would be like that in Manton's. Could he
 stand work at all, not only in a physical sense, but in
 application of mind? He began to worry about that.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some one hailed Lane, and he turned to recognize an old
 acquaintance?Matt Jones. They walked along the street
 together, meeting other men who knew Lane, some of whom greeted
 him heartily. Then, during an ensuing hour, he went into familiar
 stores and the postoffice, the hotel and finally the Bradford
 Inn, meeting many people whom he had known well. The sum of all
 their greetings left him in cold amaze. At length Lane grasped
 the subtle import?that people were tired of any one or
 anything which reminded them of the war. He tried to drive that
 thought from lodgment in his mind. But it stuck. And slowly he
 gathered the forces of his spirit to make good the resolve with
 which he had faced this day?to withstand an appalling
 truth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the inn he sat before an open fire and pondered between brief
 conversations of men who accosted him. On the one hand it was
 extremely trying, and on the other a fascinating and grim
 study?to meet people, and find that he could read their
 minds. Had the war given him some magic sixth sense, some
 clairvoyant power, some gift of vision? He could not tell yet
 what had come to him, but there was something.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Business men, halting to chat with Lane a few moments, helped
 along his readjustment to the truth of the strange present.
 Almost all kinds of business were booming. Most people had money
 to spend. And there was a multitude, made rich by the war, who
 were throwing money to the four winds. Prices of every commodity
 were at their highest peak, and supply could not equal demand. An
 orgy of spending was in full swing, and all men in business,
 especially the profiteers, were making the most of the
 unprecedented opportunity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After he had rested, Lane boarded a street car and rode out to
 the suburbs of Middleville where the Maynards lived. Although
 they had lost their money they still lived in the substantial
 mansion that was all which was left them of prosperous days.
 House and grounds now appeared sadly run down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A maid answered Lane's ring, and let him in. Lane found himself
 rather nervously expecting to see Mrs. Maynard. The old house
 brought back to him the fact that he had never liked her. But he
 wanted to see Margaret. It turned out, however, that mother and
 daughter were out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come up, old top," called Blair's voice from the hall above.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So Lane went up to Blair's room, which he remembered almost as
 well as his own, though now it was in disorder. Blair was in his
 shirt sleeves. He looked both gay and spent. Red Payson was in
 bed, and his face bore the hectic flush of fever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, he's only had too much to eat," declared Blair, in answer to
 Lane's solicitation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's that, Red?" asked Lane, sitting down on the bed beside
 Payson.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's nothing, Dare.... I'm just all in," replied Red, with a
 weary smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I telephoned Doc Bronson to come out," said Blair, "and look us
 over. That made Red as sore as a pup. Isn't he the limit? By
 thunder, you can't do anything for some people."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair's tone and words of apparent vexation were at variance with
 the kindness of his eyes as they rested upon his sick comrade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I just came from Bronson's," observed Lane. "He's been our
 doctor for as long as I can remember."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Both Lane's comrades searched his face with questioning eyes, and
 while Lane returned that gaze there was a little constrained
 silence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bronson examined me?and said I'd live to be eighty," added
 Lane, with dry humor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're a liar!" burst out Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On Red Payson's worn face a faint smile appeared. "Carry on,
 Dare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Blair fell to questioning Lane as to all the news he had
 heard, and people he had met.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So Manton turned you down cold," said Blair, ponderingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't get to see him," replied Lane. "He sent out word that
 my old job was held by a girl who did my work better and at less
 pay."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The blood leaped to Blair's white cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'd you say?" he queried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing much. I just trailed out.... But the truth is,
 Blair?I couldn't have stood that place?not for a
 day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I get you," rejoined Blair. "That isn't the point, though. I
 always wondered if we'd find our old jobs open to us. Of course,
 I couldn't fill mine now. It was an outside job?lots of
 walking."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the conversation see-sawed back and forth, with Red Payson
 listening in languid interest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you seen any of the girls?" asked Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I met Mel Iden," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did? What did she?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel told me what explained some of your hints."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh! Poor Mel! How'd she look?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Greatly changed," replied Lane, thoughtfully. "How do you
 remember Mel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, she was pretty?soulful face?wonderful
 smile?that sort of thing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's beautiful now, and sad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't wonder. And she told you right out about the baby?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. That came out when she said I couldn't call on her, and I
 wanted to know why."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you'll go anyhow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So will I," returned Blair, with spirit. "Dare, I've known for
 over a year about Mel's disgrace. You used to like her, and I
 hated to tell you. If it had been Helen I'd have told you in a
 minute. But Mel ... Well, I suppose we must expect queer things.
 I got a jolt this morning. I was pumping my sister Margie about
 everybody, and, of course, Mel's name came up. You remember
 Margie and Mel were as thick as two peas in a pod. Looks like
 Mel's fall has hurt Margie. But I don't just <i>get</i> Margie
 yet. She might be another fellow's sister?for all the
 strangeness of her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hardly knew <i>my</i> kid sister," responded Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh! The plot thickens.... Well, I couldn't get much out of
 Marg. She used to babble everything. But what little she told me
 made up in?in shock for what it lacked in volume."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me," said Lane, as his friend paused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing doing." ... And turning to the sick boy on the bed, he
 remarked, "Red, you needn't let this?this gab of ours
 bother you. This is home talk between a couple of boobs who're
 burying their illusions in the grave. You didn't leave a sister
 or a lot of old schoolgirl sweethearts behind to??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What the hell do you know about whom I left behind?" retorted
 Red, with a swift blaze of strange passion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, say, Red?I?I beg your pardon, I was only
 kidding," responded Blair, in surprise and contrition. "You never
 told me a word about yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For answer Red Payson rolled over wearily and turned his back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, I'll beat it, and let Red go to sleep," said Lane, taking
 up his hat. "Red, good-bye this time. I hope you'll be better
 soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm?sorry, Lane," came in muffled tones from Payson.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cut that out, boy. You've nothing to be sorry for. Forget it and
 cheer up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair hobbled downstairs after Lane. "Don't go just yet, Dare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They found seats in the parlor that appeared to be the same
 shabby genteel place where Lane had used to call upon Blair's
 sister.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What ails Red?" queried Lane, bluntly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord only knows. He's a queer duck. Once in a while he lets out
 a crack like that. There's a lot to Red."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, his heart is broken," said Lane, tragically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well!" exclaimed Blair, with quick almost haughty uplift of
 head. He seemed to resent Lane's surprise and intimation. It was
 a rebuke that made Lane shrink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never thought of Red's being hurt?you know?or as
 having lost.... Oh, he just seemed like so many other boys ruined
 in health. I??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. Cut the sentiment," interrupted Blair. "The fact is
 Red is more of a problem than we had any idea he'd be.... And
 Dare, listen to this?I'm ashamed to have to tell you.
 Mother raised old Harry with me this morning for fetching Red
 home. She couldn't see it my way. She said there were hospitals
 for sick soldiers who hadn't homes. I lost my temper and I said:
 'The hell of it, mother, is that there's nothing of the kind.'
 ... She said we couldn't keep him here. I tried to coax her....
 Margie helped, but nothing doing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair had spoken hurriedly with again a stain of red in his white
 cheek, and a break in his voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's?tough," replied Lane, haltingly. He could choke
 back speech, but not the something in his voice he would rather
 not have heard. "I'll tell you what. As soon as Red is well
 enough we'll move him over to my house. I'm sure mother will let
 him share my room. There's only Lorna?and I'll pay Red's
 board.... You have quite a family?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hell, Dare?don't apologize to me for my mother," burst out
 Blair, bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, I believe you realize what we are up against?and I
 don't," rejoined Lane, with level gaze upon his friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, can't you see we're up against worse than the
 Argonne??worse, because back here at home?that
 beautiful, glorious thought?idea?spirit we had is
 gone. Dead!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I can't see," returned Lane, stubbornly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I guess that's one reason we all loved you, Dare?you
 couldn't see.... But I'll bet you my crutch Helen makes you see.
 Her father made a pile out of the war. She's a war-rich snob now.
 And going the pace!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, she may make me see her faithlessness?and perhaps
 some strange unrest?some change that's seemed to come over
 everything. But she can't prove to me the death of anything
 outside of herself. She can't prove that any more than Mel Iden's
 confession proved her a wanton. It didn't. Not to me. Why, when
 Mel put her hand on my breast?on this medal?and
 looked at me?I had such a thrill as I never had before in
 all my life. Never!... Blair, it's <i>not</i> dead. That
 beautiful thing you mentioned?that spirit?that fire
 which burned so gloriously?it is <i>not</i> dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not in you?old pard," replied Blair, unsteadily. "I'm
 always ashamed before your faith. And, by God, I'll say you're my
 only anchor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, let's play the game out to the end," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I get you, Dare.... For Margie, for Lorna, for Mel?even if
 they have?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," answered Lane, as Blair faltered.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IV
 </h2>
 <p>
 As Lane sped out Elm Street in a taxicab he remembered that his
 last ride in such a conveyance had been with Helen when he took
 her home from a party. She was then about seventeen years old.
 And that night she had coaxed him to marry her before he left to
 go to war. Had her feminine instinct been infallibly right? Would
 marrying her have saved her from what Blair had so forcibly
 suggested?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Elm Street was a newly developed part of Middleville, high on one
 of its hills, and manifestly a restricted section. Lane had found
 the number of Helen's home in the telephone book. When the
 chauffeur stopped before a new and imposing pile of red brick,
 Lane understood an acquaintance's reference to the war rich. It
 was a mansion, but somehow not a home. It flaunted something
 indefinable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane instructed the driver to wait a few moments, and, if he did
 not come out, to go back to town and return in about an hour. The
 house stood rather far from the street, and as Lane mounted the
 terrace he observed four motor cars parked in the driveway. Also
 his sensitive ears caught the sound of a phonograph.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A maid answered his ring. Lane asked for both Mrs. Wrapp and
 Helen. They were at home, the maid informed him, and ushered Lane
 into a gray and silver reception room. Lane had no card, but gave
 his name. As he gazed around the room he tried to fit the
 delicate decorative scheme to Mrs. Wrapp. He smiled at the idea.
 But he remembered that she had always liked him in spite of the
 fact that she did not favor his attention to Helen. Like many
 mothers of girls, she wanted a rich marriage for her daughter.
 Manifestly now she had money. But had happiness come with
 prosperity?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mrs. Wrapp came down. Rising, he turned to see a large
 woman, elaborately gowned. She had a heavy, rather good-natured
 face on which was a smile of greeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane!" she exclaimed, with fervor, and to his surprise,
 she kissed him. There was no doubt of her pleasure. Lane's thin
 armor melted. He had not anticipated such welcome. "Oh, I'm glad
 to see you, soldier boy. But you're a man now. Daren, you're
 white and thin. Handsomer, though!... Sit down and talk to me a
 little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her kindness made his task easy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've called to pay my respects to you?and to see Helen,"
 he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course. But talk to me first," she returned, with a smile.
 "You'll find me better company than that crowd upstairs. Tell me
 about yourself.... Oh, I know soldiers hate to talk about
 themselves and the war. Never mind the war. Are you well? Did you
 get hurt? You look so?so frail, Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was something simple and motherly about her, that became
 her, and warmed Lane's cold heart. He remembered that she had
 always preferred boys to girls, and regretted she had not been
 the mother of boys. So Lane talked to her, glad to find that the
 most ordinary news of the service and his comrades interested her
 very much. The instant she espied his <i>Croix de Guerre</i> he
 seemed lifted higher in her estimation. Yet she had the delicacy
 not to question him about that. In fact, after ten minutes with
 her, Lane had to reproach himself for the hostility with which he
 had come. At length she rose with evident reluctance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You want to see Helen. Shall I send her down here or will you go
 up to her studio?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I'd like to go up," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I were you, I would," advised Mrs. Wrapp. "I'd like your
 opinion?of, well, what you'll see. Since you left home,
 Daren, we've been turned topsy-turvy. I'm old-fashioned. I can't
 get used to these goings-on. These young people 'get my goat,' as
 Helen expresses it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm hopelessly behind the times, I've seen that already,"
 rejoined Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I respect you for it. There was a time when I objected to
 your courting Helen. But I couldn't see into the future. I'm
 sorry now she broke her engagement to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?thank you, Mrs. Wrapp," said Lane, with agitation. "But
 of course Helen was right. She was too young.... And even if she
 had been?been true to me?I would have freed her upon
 my return."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed. And why, Daren?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I'll never be well again," he replied sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy, don't say that!" she appealed, with a hand going to his
 shoulder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the poignancy of the moment Lane lost his reserve and told her
 the truth of his condition, even going so far as to place her
 hand so she felt the great bayonet hole in his back. Her silence
 then was more expressive than any speech. She had the look of a
 woman in whom conscience was a reality. And Lane divined that she
 felt she and her daughter, and all other women of this distraught
 land, owed him and his comrades a debt which could never be paid.
 For once she expressed dignity and sweetness and genuine sorrow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You shock me, Daren. But words are useless. I hope and pray
 you're wrong. But right or wrong?you're a real
 American?like our splendid forefathers. Thank God
 <i>that</i> spirit still survives. It is our only hope."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane crossed to the window and looked out, slowly conscious of
 resurging self-control. It was well that he had met Mrs. Wrapp
 first, for she gave him what he needed. His bleeding vanity, his
 pride trampled in the dirt, his betrayed faith, his unquenchable
 spirit of hope for some far-future good?these were not
 secrets he could hide from every one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren," said Mrs. Wrapp, as he again turned to her, "if I were
 in my daughter's place I'd beg you to take me back. And if you
 would, I'd never leave your side for an hour until you were well
 or?or gone. ... But girls now are possessed of some
 infernal frenzy.... God only knows how <i>far</i> they go, but
 I'm one mother who is no fool. I see little sign of real love in
 Helen or any of her friends.... And the men who lounge around
 after her! Walk upstairs?back to the end of the long
 hall?open the door and go in. You'll find Helen and some of
 her associates. You'll find the men, young, sleek, soft,
 well-fed?without any of the scars or ravages of war. They
 didn't go to war!... They <i>live</i> for their bodies. And I
 hate these slackers. So does Helen's father. And for three years
 our house has been a rendezvous for them. We've prospered, but
 <i>that</i> has been bitter fruit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Strong elemental passions Lane had seen and felt in people during
 the short twenty-four hours since his return home. All of them
 had stung and astounded him, flung into his face the hard brutal
 facts of the materialism of the present. Surely it was an
 abnormal condition. And yet from the last quarter where he might
 have expected to find uplift, and the crystallizing of his
 attitude toward the world, and the sharpening of his
 intelligence?from the hard, grim mother of the girl who had
 jilted him, these had come. It was in keeping with all the other
 mystery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On second thought, I'll go up with you," continued Mrs. Wrapp,
 as he moved in the direction she had indicated. "Come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The wide hall, the winding stairway with its soft carpet, the
 narrower hallway above?these made a long journey for Lane.
 But at the end, when Mrs. Wrapp stopped with hand on the farthest
 door, Lane felt knit like cold steel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The discordant music and the soft shuffling of feet ceased.
 Laughter and murmur of voices began.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, Daren," whispered Mrs. Wrapp, as if thrilled. Certainly
 her eyes gleamed. Then quickly she threw the door open wide and
 called out:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, here's Daren Lane home from the war, wearing the <i>Croix
 de Guerre</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Wrapp pushed Lane forward, and stood there a moment in the
 sudden silence, then stepping back, she went out and closed the
 door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane saw a large well-lighted room, with colorful bizarre
 decorations and a bare shiny floor. The first person his glance
 encountered was a young girl, strikingly beautiful, facing him
 with red lips parted. She had violet eyes that seemed to have a
 startled expression as they met Lane's. Next Lane saw a slim
 young man standing close to this girl, in the act of withdrawing
 his arm from around her waist. Apparently with his free hand he
 had either been lowering a smoking cigarette from her lips or had
 been raising it there. This hand, too, dropped down. Lane did not
 recognize the fellow's smooth, smug face, with its tiny curled
 mustache and its heated swollen lines.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look who's here," shouted a gay, vibrant voice. "If it isn't old
 Dare Lane!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That voice drew Lane's fixed gaze, and he saw a group in the far
 corner of the room. One man was standing, another was sitting
 beside a lounge, upon which lay a young woman amid a pile of
 pillows. She rose lazily, and as she slid off the lounge Lane saw
 her skirt come down and cover her bare knees. Her red hair,
 bobbed and curly, marked her for recognition. It was Helen. But
 Lane doubted if he would have at once recognized any other
 feature. The handsome insolence of her face was belied by a
 singularly eager and curious expression. Her eyes, almost green
 in line, swept Lane up and down, and came back to his face, while
 she extended her hands in greeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, how are you?" said Lane, with a cool intent mastery of
 himself, bowing over her hands. "Surprised to see me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll say so! Daren, you've changed," she replied, and the
 latter part of her speech flashed swiftly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rather," he said, laconically. "What would you expect? So have
 you changed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There came a moment's pause. Helen was not embarrassed or
 agitated, but something about Lane or the situation apparently
 made her slow or stiff.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you?of course you remember Hardy Mackay and Dick
 Swann," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned to greet one-time schoolmates and rivals of his.
 Mackay was tall, homely, with a face that lacked force, light
 blue eyes and thick sandy hair, brushed high. Swann was slight,
 elegant, faultlessly groomed and he had a dark, sallow face,
 heavy lips, heavy eyelids, eyes rather prominent and of a
 wine-dark hue. To Lane he did not have a clean, virile look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In their greetings Lane sensed some indefinable quality of
 surprise or suspense. Swann rather awkwardly put out his hand,
 but Lane ignored it. The blood stained Swann's sallow face and he
 drew himself up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Daren, here are other friends of mine," said Helen, and she
 turned him round. "Bessy, this is Daren Lane.... Miss Bessy
 Bell." As Lane acknowledged the introduction he felt that he was
 looking at the prettiest girl he had ever seen?the girl
 whose violet eyes had met his when he entered the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Daren Lane, I'm very happy to meet some one from 'over
 there,'" she said, with the ease and self-possession of a woman
 of the world. But when she smiled a beautiful, wonderful light
 seemed to shine from eyes and face and lips?a smile of
 youth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen introduced her companion as Roy Vancey. Then she led Lane
 to the far corner, to another couple, manifestly disturbed from
 their rather close and familiar position in a window seat. These
 also were strangers to Lane. They did not get up, and they were
 not interested. In fact, Lane was quick to catch an impression
 from all, possibly excepting Miss Bell, that the courtesy of
 drawing rooms, such as he had been familiar with as a young man,
 was wanting in this atmosphere. Lane wondered if it was
 antagonism toward him. Helen drew Lane back toward her other
 friends, to the lounge where she seated herself. If the situation
 had disturbed her equilibrium in the least, the moment had
 passed. She did not care what Lane thought of her guests or what
 they thought of him. But she seemed curious about him. Bessy Bell
 came and sat beside her, watching Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, do you dance?" queried Helen. "You used to be good. But
 dancing is not the same. It's all fox-trot, toddle, shimmy
 nowadays."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid my dancing days are over," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How so? I see you came back with two legs and arms."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. But I was shot twice through one leg?it's about all I
 can do to walk now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Following his easy laugh, a little silence ensued. Helen's green
 eyes seemed to narrow and concentrate on Lane. Dick Swann inhaled
 a deep draught of his cigarette, then let the smoke curl up from
 his lips to enter his nostrils. Mackay rather uneasily shifted
 his feet. And Bessy Bell gazed with wonderful violet eyes at
 Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! You were <i>shot</i>!" she whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Lane, and looked directly at her, prompted by her
 singular tone. A glance was enough to show Lane that this very
 young girl was an entirely new type to him. She seemed to vibrate
 with intensity. All the graceful lines of her body seemed
 strangely instinct with pulsing life. She was bottled lightning.
 In a flash Lane sensed what made her different from the
 fifteen-year-olds he remembered before the war. It was what made
 his sister Lorna different. He felt it in Helen's scrutiny of
 him, in the speculation of her eyes. Then Bessy Bell leaned
 toward Lane, and softly, reverently touched the medal upon his
 breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The <i>Croix de Guerre</i>," she said, in awe. "That's the
 French badge of honor.... It means you must have done something
 great.... You must have?<i>killed</i> Germans!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy sank back upon the lounge, clasping her hands, and her eyes
 appeared to darken, to turn purple with quickening thought and
 emotion. Her exclamation brought the third girl of the party over
 to the lounge. She was all eyes. Her apathy had vanished. She did
 not see the sulky young fellow who had followed her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could have laughed aloud. He read the shallow souls of these
 older girls. They could not help their instincts and he had
 learned that it was instinctive with women to become emotional
 over soldiers. Bessy Bell was a child. Hero-worship shone from
 her speaking eyes. Whatever other young men might be to her, no
 one of them could compare with a soldier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The situation had its pathos, its tragedy, and its gratification
 for Lane. He saw clearly, and felt with the acuteness of a woman.
 Helen had jilted him for such young men as these. So in the
 feeling of the moment it cost him nothing to thrill and fascinate
 these girls with the story of how he had been shot through the
 leg. It pleased him to see Helen's green eyes dilate, to see
 Bessy Bell shudder. Presently Lane turned to speak to the
 supercilious Swann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't have the luck to run across you in France!" he queried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I didn't go," replied Swann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How was that? Didn't the draft get you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. But my eyes were bad. And my father needed me at the works.
 We had a big army contract in steel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I see," returned Lane, with a subtle alteration of manner he
 could not, did not want to control. But it was unmistakable in
 its detachment. Next his gaze on Mackay did not require the
 accompaniment of a query.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was under weight. They wouldn't accept me," he explained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy Bell looked at Mackay disdainfully. "Why didn't you drink a
 bucketful of water?same as Billy Means did? He got in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen laughed gayly. "What! Mac drink water? He'd be ill....
 Come, let's dance. Dick put on that new one. Daren, you can watch
 us dance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann did as he was bidden, and as a loud, violent discordance
 blared out of the machine he threw away his cigarette, and turned
 to Helen. She seemed to leap at him. She had a pantherish grace.
 Swann drew her closely to him, with his arm all the way round
 her, while her arm encircled his neck. They began a fast swaying
 walk, in which Swann appeared to be forcing the girl over
 backwards. They swayed, and turned, and glided; they made strange
 abrupt movements in accordance with the jerky tune; they halted
 at the end of a walk to make little steps forward and back; then
 they began to bounce and sway together in a motion that Lane
 instantly recognized as a toddle. Lane remembered the one-step,
 the fox-trot and other new dances of an earlier day, when the
 craze for new dancing had become general, but this sort of
 gyration was vastly something else. It disgusted Lane. He felt
 the blood surge to his face. He watched Helen Wrapp in the arms
 of Swann, and he realized, whatever had been the state of his
 heart on his return home, he did not love her now. Even if the
 war had not disrupted his mind in an unaccountable way, even if
 he had loved Helen Wrapp right up to that moment, such singular
 abandonment to a distorted strange music, to the close and
 unmistakably sensual embrace of a man?that spectacle would
 have killed his love.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned his gaze away. The young fellow Vancey was pulling at
 Bessy Bell, and she shook his hand off. "No, Roy, I don't want to
 dance." Lane heard above the jarring, stringing notes. Mackay was
 smoking, and looked on as if bored. In a moment more the Victrola
 rasped out its last note.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen's face was flushed and moist. Her bosom heaved. Her gown
 hung closely to her lissom and rather full form. A singular
 expression of excitement, of titillation, almost wild, a softer
 expression almost dreamy, died out of her face. Lane saw Swann
 lead Helen up to a small table beside the Victrola. Here stood a
 large pitcher of lemonade, and a number of glasses. Swann filled
 a glass half full, from the pitcher, and then, deliberately
 pulling a silver flask from his hip pocket he poured some of its
 dark red contents into the glass. Helen took it from him, and
 turned to Lane with a half-mocking glance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I remember you never drank," she said. "Maybe the war
 made a man of you!... Will you have a sip of lemonade with a shot
 in it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thank you," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't you drink over there?" she queried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only when I had to," he rejoined, shortly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All of the four dancers partook of a drink of lemonade,
 strengthened by something from Swann's flask. Lane was quick to
 observe that when it was pressed upon Bessy Bell she refused to
 take it: "I hate booze," she said, with a grimace. His further
 impression of Bessy Bell, then, was that she had just fallen in
 with this older crowd, and sophisticated though she was, had not
 yet been corrupted. The divination of this heightened his
 interest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Daren, you old prune, what'd you think of the toddle?"
 asked Helen, as she took a cigarette offered by Swann and tipped
 it between her red lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that what you danced?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say so. And Dick and I are considered pretty spiffy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think much of it, Helen," replied Lane, deliberately.
 "If you care to?to do that sort of thing I'd imagine you'd
 rather do it alone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh Lord, you talk like mother," she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you're out of date," said Swann, with a little sneer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane took a long, steady glance at Swann, but did not reply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, everybody has been dancing jazz. It's the rage. The old
 dances were slow. The new ones have pep and snap."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So I see. They have more than that," returned Lane. "But pray,
 never mind me. I'm out of date. Go ahead and dance.... If you'd
 rather, I'll leave and call on you some other time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you stay," she replied. "I'll chase this bunch pretty soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you won't chase me. I'll go," spoke up Swann, sullenly,
 with a fling of his cigarette.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You needn't hurt yourself," returned Helen, sarcastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So long, people," said Swann to the others. But it was perfectly
 obvious that he did not include Lane. It was also obvious, at
 least to Lane, that Swann showed something of intolerance and
 mastery in the dark, sullen glance he bestowed upon Helen. She
 followed him across the room and out into the hall, from whence
 her guarded voice sounded unintelligibly. But Lane's keen ear,
 despite the starting of the Victrola, caught Swann's equally low,
 yet clearer reply. "You can't kid me. I'm on. You'll vamp Lane if
 he lets you. Go to it!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Helen came back into the room Mackay ran for her, and locking
 her in the same embrace?even a tighter one than
 Swann's?he fell into the strange steps that had so shocked
 Lane. Moreover, he was manifestly a skilful dancer, and showed
 the thin, lithe, supple body of one trained down by this or some
 other violent exercise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane did not watch the dancers this time. Again Bessy Bell
 refused to get up from the lounge. The youth was insistent. He
 pawed at her. And manifestly she did not like that, for her face
 flamed, and she snapped: "Stop it?you bonehead! Can't you
 see I want to sit here by Mr. Lane?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The youth slouched away fuming to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon Lane got up, and seated himself beside Bessy so that he
 need not shout to be heard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was nice of you, Miss Bell?but rather hard on the
 youngster," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He makes me sick. All he wants to do is lolly-gag.... Besides,
 after what you said to Helen about the jazz I wouldn't dance in
 front of you on a bet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was forceful, frank, naive. She was impressed by his
 nearness; but Lane saw that it was the fact of his being a
 soldier with a record, not his mere physical propinquity that
 affected her. She seemed both bold and shy. But she did not show
 any modesty. Her short skirt came above her bare knees, and she
 did not try to hide them from Lane's sight. At fifteen, like his
 sister Lorna, this girl had the development of a young woman. She
 breathed health, and something elusive that Lane could not catch.
 If it had not been for her apparent lack of shame, and her rouged
 lips and cheeks, and her plucked eyebrows, she would have been
 exceedingly alluring. But no beauty, however striking, could
 under these circumstances, stir Lane's heart. He was fascinated,
 puzzled, intensely curious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why wouldn't you dance jazz in front of me?" he inquired, with a
 smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, for one thing I'm not stuck on it, and for another I'll
 say you said a mouthful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that all?" he asked, as if disappointed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I'd respect what you said?because of where you've been
 and what you've done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a reply that surprised Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm out of date, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She put a finger on the medal on his breast and said: "You could
 never be out of date."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The music and the sliding shuffle ceased.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now beat it," said Helen. "I want to talk to Daren." She gayly
 shoved the young people ahead of her in a mass, and called to
 Bessy: "Here, you kid vamp, lay off Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy leaned to whisper in his ear: "Make a date with me, quick!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Surely, I'll hunt you up. Good-bye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She was the only one who made any pretension of saying good-bye
 to Lane. They all crowded out before Helen, with Mackay in the
 rear. From the hall Lane heard him say to Helen: "Dick'll sure go
 to the mat with you for this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently Helen returned to shut the door behind her; and her
 walk toward Lane had a suggestion of the oriental dancer. For
 Lane her face was a study. This seemed a woman beyond his
 comprehension. She was the Helen Wrapp he had known and loved,
 plus an age of change, a measureless experience. With that
 swaying, sinuous, pantherish grace, with her green eyes narrowed
 and gleaming, half mocking, half serious, she glided up to him,
 close, closer until she pressed against him, and her face was
 uplifted under his. Then she waited with her eyes gazing into
 his. Slumberous green depths, slowly lighting, they seemed to
 Lane. Her presence thus, her brazen challenge, affected him
 powerfully, but he had no thrill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you going to kiss me?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, why didn't you write me you had broken our engagement?"
 he counter-queried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The question disconcerted her somewhat. Drawing back from close
 contact with him she took hold of his sleeves, and assumed a
 naive air of groping in memory. She used her eyes in a way that
 Lane could not associate with the past he knew. She was a
 flirt?not above trying her arts on the man she had jilted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, didn't I write you? Of course I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if you did I never got the letter. And if you were on the
 level you'd admit you never wrote."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd you find out then?" she inquired curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never knew for sure until your mother verified it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Are you curious to know why I did break it off?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not in the least."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This reply shot the fire into her face, yet she still persisted
 in the expression of her sentimental motive. She began to finger
 the medal on his breast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So, Mr. Soldier Hero, you didn't care?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?not after I had been here ten minutes," he replied,
 bluntly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She whirled from him, swiftly, her body instinct with passion,
 her expression one of surprise and fury.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean by that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing I care to explain, except I discovered my love for you
 was dead?perhaps had been dead for a long time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you never discovered it until you <i>saw</i>
 me?here?with Swann?dancing, drinking, smoking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. To be honest, the shock of that enlightened me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane, I'm just what <i>you</i> men have made me," she
 burst out, passionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are mistaken. I beg to be excluded from any complicity in
 the?in whatever you've been made," he said, bitterly. "I
 have been true to you in deed and in thought all this time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must be a queer soldier!" she exclaimed, incredulously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I figure there were a couple of million soldiers like me, queer
 or not," he retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gazed at him with something akin to hate in her eyes. Then
 putting her hands to her full hips she began that swaying,
 dancing walk to and fro before the window. She was deeply hurt.
 Lane had meant to get under her skin with a few just words of
 scorn, and he had imagined his insinuation as to the change in
 her had hurt her feelings. Suddenly he divined it was not that at
 all?he had only wounded her vanity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, let's not talk of the past," he said. "It's over. Even if
 you had been true to me, and I loved you still?I would have
 been compelled to break our engagement."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would! And why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am a physical wreck?and a mental one, too, I fear....
 Helen, I've come home to die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren!" she cried, poignantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he told her in brief, brutal words of the wounds and ravages
 war had dealt him, and what Doctor Bronson's verdict had been.
 Lane felt shame in being so little as to want to shock and hurt
 her, if that were possible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'm sorry," she burst out. "Your mother?your
 sister.... Oh, that damned horrible war! <i>What</i> has it not
 done to us?... Daren, you looked white and weak, but I never
 thought you were?going to die.... How dreadful!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something of her girlishness returned to her in this moment of
 sincerity. The past was not wholly dead. Memories lingered. She
 looked at Lane, wide-eyed, in distress, caught between strange
 long-forgotten emotions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, it's not dreadful to have to die," replied Lane.
 "<i>That</i> is not the dreadful part in coming home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What <i>is</i> dreadful, then?" she asked, very low.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane felt a great heave of his breast?the irrepressible
 reaction of a profound and terrible emotion, always held in
 abeyance until now. And a fierce pang, that was physical as well
 as emotional, tore through him. His throat constricted and ached
 to a familiar sensation?the welling up of blood from his
 lungs. The handkerchief he put to his lips came away stained red.
 Helen saw it, and with dilated eyes, moved instinctively as if to
 touch him, hold him in her pity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, Helen," he said, huskily. "That's nothing.... Well,
 I was about to tell you what is so dreadful?for me.... It's
 to reach home grateful to God I was spared to get
 home?resigned to the ruin of my life?content to die
 for whom I fought?my mother, my sister, <i>you</i>, and all
 our women (for I fought for nothing else)?and find my
 mother aged and bewildered and sad, my sister a painted little
 hussy?and <i>you</i>?a strange creature I despise....
 And all, everybody, everything changed?changed in some
 horrible way which proves my sacrifice in vain.... It is not
 death that is dreadful, but the uselessness, the hopelessness of
 the ideal I cherished."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen fell on the couch, and burying her face in the pillows she
 began to sob. Lane looked down at her, at her glistening auburn
 hair, and slender, white, ringed hand clutching the cushions, at
 her lissom shaking form, at the shapely legs in the rolled-down
 silk stockings?and he felt a melancholy happiness in the
 proof that he had reached her shallow heart, and in the fact that
 this was the moment of loss.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye?Helen," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren?don't?go," she begged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he had to go, for other reasons beside the one that this was
 the end of all intimate relation between him and Helen. He had
 overtaxed his strength, and the burning pang in his breast was
 one he must heed. On the hall stairway a dizzy spell came over
 him. He held on to the banister until the weakness passed.
 Fortunately there was no one to observe him. Somehow the
 sumptuous spacious hall seemed drearily empty. Was this a home
 for that twenty-year-old girl upstairs? Lane opened the door and
 went out. He was relieved to find the taxi waiting. To the driver
 he gave the address of his home and said: "Go slow and don't give
 me a jar!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Lane reached home, and got into the house, where he sat at
 the table with his mother and Lorna, making a pretense of eating,
 and went upstairs and into his bed without any recurrence of the
 symptoms that had alarmed him. In the darkness of his room he
 gradually relaxed to rest. And rest was the only medicine for
 him. It had put off hour by hour and day by day the inevitable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If it comes?all right?I'm ready," he whispered to
 himself. "But in spite of all I've been through?and have
 come home to?I don't <i>want</i> to die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was no use in trying to sleep. But in this hour he did not
 want oblivion. He wanted endless time to think. And slowly, with
 infinite care and infallible memory, he went over every detail of
 what he had seen and heard since his arrival home. In the
 headlong stream of consciousness of the past hours he met with
 circumstances that he lingered over, and tried to understand, to
 no avail. Yet when all lay clearly before his mental gaze he felt
 a sad and tremendous fascination in the spectacle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For many weeks he had lived on the fancy of getting home, of
 being honored and loved, of being given some little meed of
 praise and gratitude in the short while he had to live. Alas!
 this fancy had been a dream of his egotism. His old world was
 gone. There was nothing left. The day of the soldier had
 passed?until some future need of him stirred the emotions
 of a selfish people. This new world moved on unmindful, through
 its travail and incalculable change, to unknown ends. He, Daren
 Lane, had been left alone on the vast and naked shores of Lethe.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane made not one passionate protest at the injustice of his
 fate. Labor, agony, war had taught him wisdom and vision. He
 began to realize that no greater change could there be than this
 of his mind, his soul. But in the darkness there an irresistible
 grief assailed him. He wept as never before in all his life. And
 he tasted the bitter salt of his own tears. He wept for his
 mother, aged and bowed by trouble, bewildered, ready to give up
 the struggle?his little sister now forced into erotic
 girlhood, blind, wilful, bold, on the wrong path, doomed beyond
 his power or any earthly power?the men he had met, warped
 by the war, materialistic, lost in the maze of self-preservation
 and self-aggrandizement, dead to chivalry and the honor of
 women?Mel Iden, strangest and saddest of mysteries?a
 girl who had been noble, aloof, proud, with a heart of golden
 fire, now disgraced, ruined, the mother of a war-baby, and yet,
 strangest of all, not vile, not bad, not lost, but groping like
 he was down those vast and naked shores of life. He wept for the
 hard-faced Mrs. Wrapp, whose ideal had been wealth and who had
 found prosperity bitter ashes at her lips, yet who preserved in
 this modern maelstrom some sense of its falseness, its baseness.
 He wept for Helen, playmate of the years never to return,
 sweetheart of his youth, betrayer of his manhood, the young woman
 of the present, blase, unsexed, seeking, provocative, all
 perhaps, as she had said, that men had made her?a travesty
 on splendid girlhood. He wept for her friends, embodying in them
 all of their class?for little Bessy Bell, with her
 exquisite golden beauty, her wonderful smile that was a light of
 joy?a child of fifteen with character and mind, not yet
 sullied, not yet wholly victim to the unstable spirit of the day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And traveling in this army that seemed to march before Lane's
 eyes were the slackers, like Mackay and Swann, representative of
 that horde of cowards who in one way or another had avoided the
 service?the young men who put comfort, ease, safety,
 pleasure before all else?who had no ideal of
 womanhood?who could not have protected women?who
 would not fight to save women from the apish Huns?who
 remained behind to fall in the wreck of the war's degeneration,
 and to dance, to drink, to smoke, to ride the women to their
 debasement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And for the first and the last time Lane wept for himself,
 pitifully as a child lost and helpless, as a strong man facing
 irreparable loss, as a boy who had dreamed beautiful dreams, who
 had loved and given and trusted, who had suffered insupportable
 agonies of body and soul, who had fought like a lion for what he
 represented to himself, who had killed and killed?and whose
 reward was change, indifference, betrayal and death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That dark hour passed. Lane lay spent in the blackness of his
 room. His heart had broken. But his spirit was as unquenchable as
 the fire of the sun. If he had a year, a month, a week, a day
 longer to live he could never live it untrue to himself. Life had
 marked him to be a sufferer, a victim. But nothing could kill his
 soul. And his soul was his faith?something he understood as
 faith in God or nature or life?in the reason for his
 being?in his vision of the future.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How then to spend this last remnant of his life! No one would
 guess what passed through his lonely soul. No one would care. But
 out of the suffering that now seemed to give him spirit and
 wisdom and charity there dawned a longing to help, to save. He
 would return good for evil. All had failed him, but he would fail
 no one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he had a strange intense desire to understand the present.
 Only a day home?and what colossal enigma! The war had been
 chaos. Was this its aftermath? Had people been rocked on their
 foundations? What were they doing?how living?how
 changing? He would see, and be grateful for a little time to
 prove his faith. He knew he would find the same thing in others
 that existed in himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would help his mother, and cheer her, and try to revive
 something of hope in her. He would bend a keen and patient eye
 upon Lorna, and take the place of her father, and be kind,
 loving, yet blunt to her, and show her the inevitable end of this
 dancing, dallying road. Perhaps he could influence Helen. He
 would see the little soldier-worshipping Bessy Bell, and if by
 talking hours and hours, by telling the whole of his awful
 experience of war, he could take up some of the time so fraught
 with peril for her, he would welcome the ordeal of memory. And
 Mel Iden?how thought of her seemed tinged with strange
 regret! Once she and he had been dear friends, and because of a
 falsehood told by Helen that friendship had not been what it
 might have been. Suppose Mel, instead of Helen, had loved him and
 been engaged to him! Would he have been jilted and would Mel have
 been lost? No! It was a subtle thing?that answer of his
 spirit. It did not agree with Mel Iden's frank confession.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It might be difficult, he reflected, to approach Mel. But he
 would find a way. He would rest a few days?then find where
 she lived and go to see her. Could he help her? And he had an
 infinite exaltation in his power to help any one who had
 suffered. Lane recalled Mel's pale sweet face, the shadowed eyes,
 the sad tremulous lips. And this image of her seemed the most
 lasting of the impressions of the day.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER V
 </h2>
 <p>
 The arbiters of social fate in Middleville assembled at Mrs.
 Maynard's on a Monday afternoon, presumably to partake of tea.
 Seldom, however, did they meet without adding zest to the
 occasion by a pricking down of names.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Wrapp was the leading spirit of this self-appointed
 tribunal?a circumstance of expanding, resentment to Mrs.
 Maynard, who had once held the reins with aristocratic hands.
 Mrs. Kingsley, the third member of the great triangle, claimed an
 ancestor on the Mayflower, which was in her estimation a guerdon
 of blue blood. Her elaborate and exclusive entertainments could
 never be rivalled by those of Mrs. Wrapp. She was a widow with
 one child, the daughter Elinor, a girl of nineteen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard was tall, pale, and worldly. Traces of lost beauty
 flashed in her rare smiles. When Frank Maynard had failed in
 business she had shrouded her soul in bitterness; and she saw the
 slow cruel years whiten his head and bend his shoulders with the
 cold eye of a woman who had no forgiveness for failure. After Mr.
 Maynard's reverse, all that kept the pair together were the son
 Blair, and the sweet, fair-haired, delicate Margaret, a girl of
 eighteen, whom the father loved, and for whom the mother had
 large ambitions. They still managed, in ways mysterious to the
 curious, to keep their fine residence in the River Park suburb of
 Middleville.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On this April afternoon the tea was neglected in the cups, and
 there was nothing of the usual mild gossip. The discussion
 involved Daren Lane, and when two of those social arbiters
 settled back in their chairs the open sesame of Middleville's
 select affairs had been denied to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did he do it?" asked Mrs. Kingsley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He must have been under the influence of liquor," replied Mrs.
 Maynard, who had her own reasons for being relieved at the
 disgrace of Daren Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Jane, you're wrong," spoke up Mrs. Wrapp, who, whatever else
 she might be, was blunt and fair-minded. "Lane wasn't drunk. He
 never drank before the war. I knew him well. He and Helen had a
 puppy-love affair?they were engaged before Lane went to
 war. Well, the day after his return he called on us. And if I
 never liked him before I liked him then. He's come back to die!
 He was ill for two weeks?and then he crawled out of bed
 again. I met him down town one day. He really looked better, and
 told me with a sad smile that he had 'his ups and downs'.... No,
 Lane wasn't drunk at Fanchon Smith's dance the other night. I was
 there, and I was with Mrs. Smith when Lane came up to us. If ever
 I saw a cool, smooth, handsome devil it was Lane.... Well, he
 said what he said. I thought Mrs. Smith would faint. It is my
 idea Lane had a deep motive back of his remark about Fanchon's
 dress and her dancing. The fact is Lane was <i>sick</i> at what
 he saw?sick and angry. And he wanted Fanchon's mother and
 me to know what he thought."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was an insult," declared Mrs. Maynard, vehemently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It made Mrs. Smith ill," added Mrs. Kingsley. "She told me
 Fanchon tormented the life out of her, trying to learn what Lane
 said. Mrs. Smith would not tell. But Fanchon came to me and
 <i>I</i> told her. Such a perfectly furious girl! She'll not wear
 <i>that</i> dress or dance <i>that</i> dance very soon again. The
 story is all over town."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Friends, there are two sides to every question," interposed the
 forceful Mrs. Wrapp. "If Lane cared to be popular he would have
 used more tact. But I don't think his remark was an insult. It
 was pretty raw, I admit. But the dress was indecent and the dance
 was rotten. Helen told me Fanchon was half shot. So how could she
 be insulted?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard and Mrs. Kingsley, as usual, received Mrs. Wrapp's
 caustic and rather crude opinions with as good grace as they
 could muster. Plain it was that they felt themselves a shade
 removed from this younger and newer member of society. But they
 could not show direct antagonism to her influence any more than
 they could understand the common sense and justice of her
 arguments.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No one will ever invite him again," declared Mrs. Maynard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He's done in Middleville," echoed Mrs. Kingsley. And that
 perhaps was a gauntlet thrown.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rot!" exclaimed Mrs. Wrapp, with more force than elegance. "I'll
 invite Daren Lane to my house.... You women don't get the point.
 Daren Lane is a soldier come home to die. He gave himself. And he
 returns to find all?all this sickening?oh, what shall
 I call it? What does he care whether or not we invite him? Can't
 you see that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There's a good deal in what you say," returned Mrs. Kingsley,
 influenced by the stronger spirit. "Maybe Lane hated the new
 styles. I don't blame him much. There's something wrong with our
 young people. The girls are crazy. The boys are wild. Few of them
 are marrying?or even getting engaged. They'll do
 <i>anything</i>. The times are different. And we mothers don't
 know our daughters."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I know <i>mine</i>" returned Mrs. Maynard, loftily. "What
 you say may be true generally, but there are exceptions. My
 daughter has been too well brought up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Margie is well-bred," retorted Mrs. Wrapp. "We'll admit she
 hasn't gone to extremes, as most of our girls have. But I want to
 observe to you that she has been a wall-flower for a year."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It certainly <i>is</i> a problem," sighed Mrs. Kingsley. "I feel
 helpless?out of it. Elinor does precisely what she wants to
 do. She wears outlandish clothes. She smokes and?I'm afraid
 drinks. And dances?<i>dreadfully.</i> Just like the other
 girls?no better, no worse. But with all that I think she's
 good. I feel the same as Jane feels about that. In spite of
 this?this modern stuff I believe all the girls are
 fundamentally the same as ten years ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's where you mothers get in wrong," declared Mrs.
 Wrapp with her vigorous bluntness. "It's your pride. Just because
 they're <i>your</i> daughters they are above reproach.... What
 have you to say about the war babies in town? Did you ever hear
 of <i>that</i> ten years ago? You bet you didn't. These girls are
 a speedy set. Some of them are just wild for the sake of
 wildness. Most of them <i>have</i> to stand for things, or be
 left out altogether."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What in the world can we do?" queried Mrs. Maynard, divided
 between distress and chagrin.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The good Lord only knows," responded Mrs. Wrapp, herein losing
 her assurance. "Marriage would save most of them. But Helen
 doesn't want to marry. She wants to paint pictures and be free."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Perhaps marriage is a solution," rejoined Mrs. Maynard
 thoughtfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whom on earth can we marry them to?" asked Mrs. Kingsley. "Most
 of the older men, the bachelors who're eligible haven't any use
 for these girls except to <i>play</i> with them. True, these
 young boys only think of little but dances, car-rides, and
 sneaking off alone to spoon?they get engaged to this girl
 and that one. But nothing comes of it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're wrong. Never in my time have I seen girls find lovers and
 husbands as easily as now," declared Mrs. Wrapp. "Nor get rid of
 them so quickly.... Jane, you can marry Margaret. She's pretty
 and sweet even if you have spoiled her. The years are slipping
 by. Margaret ought to marry. She's not strong enough to work.
 Marriage for her would make things so much easier for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that parting dig Mrs. Wrapp rose to go. Whereupon she and
 Mrs. Kingsley, with gracious words of invitation and farewell,
 took themselves off leaving Mrs. Maynard contending with an
 outraged spirit. Certain terse remarks of the crude and practical
 Mrs. Wrapp had forced to her mind a question that of late had
 assumed cardinal importance, and now had been brought to an issue
 by a proposal for Margaret's hand. Her daughter was a great
 expense, really more than could longer be borne in these times of
 enormous prices and shrunken income. A husband had been found for
 Margaret, and the matter could be adjusted easily enough, if the
 girl did not meet it with the incomprehensible obstinacy peculiar
 to her of late.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard found the fair object of her hopes seated in the
 middle of her room with the bright contents of numerous boxes and
 drawers strewn in glittering heaps around her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, what on earth are you doing there?" she demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm looking for a little picture Holt Dalrymple gave me when we
 went to school together," responded Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aren't you ever going to grow up? You'll be hunting for your
 dolls next."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I will if I like," said the daughter, in a tone that did not
 manifest a seraphic mood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you feel well?" inquired the mother, solicitously.
 Margaret was frail and subject to headaches that made her
 violent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'm well enough."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My dear," rejoined Mrs. Maynard, changing the topic. "I'm sorry
 to tell you Daren Lane has lost his standing in Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hum and the honk of a motor-car sounded in the street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor Daren! What's he done?... Any old day he'll care!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard was looking out of the window. "Here comes a crowd
 of girls.... Helen Wrapp has a new suit. Well, I'll go down. And
 after they leave I want a serious talk with you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not if I see you first!" muttered Margaret, under her breath, as
 her mother walked out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently, following gay talk and laughter down stairs, a bevy of
 Margaret's friends entered her boudoir.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, old socks!" was Helen's greeting. "You look punk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Marg, where's the doll? Your mother tipped us off," was Elinor's
 greeting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's the eats?" was Flossie Dickerson's greeting. She was a
 bright-eyed girl, with freckles on her smiling face, and the
 expression of a daring, vivacious and happy spirit?and
 acknowledged to be the best dancer and most popular girl in
 Middleville. Her dress, while not to be compared with her
 friends' costumes in costliness, yet was extreme in the
 prevailing style.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Glad to see you, old dear," was dark-eyed, dark-haired Dorothy
 Dalrymple's greeting. Her rich color bore no hint of the
 artificial. She sank down on her knees beside Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The other girls draped themselves comfortably round the room; and
 Flossie with a 'Yum Yum' began to dig into a box of candy on
 Margaret's couch. They all talked at once. "Hear the latest,
 Marg?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look at Helen's spiffy suit!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, money, money, what it will buy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Money'll never buy <i>me</i>, I'll say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Marg, who's been fermentin' round lately? Girls, get wise to the
 flowers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog! See Marg blush! That comes from being so pale. What are
 rouge and lip-stick and powder for but to hide truth from our
 masculine pursuers?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Floss, you haven't blushed for a million years."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Dorothy Dalrymple who silenced the idle badinage.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Marg, you rummaging in the past?" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and I love it," replied Margaret. "I haven't looked over
 this stuff for years. Just to remember the things I did!... Here,
 Dal, is a picture you once drew of our old teacher, Miss Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dorothy, whom the girls nicknamed "Dal," gazed at the drawing
 with amaze and regret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She was a terror," continued Margaret. "But Dal, you never had
 any reason to draw such a horrible picture of her. You were her
 pet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wasn't," declared Dorothy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe you never knew Miss Hill adored you, Dal," interposed
 Elinor. "She was always holding you up as a paragon. Not in your
 lessons?for you were a bonehead?but for deportment
 you were the class!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dal, you were too good for this earth <i>then</i>, let alone
 these days," said Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Hill," mused Elinor, gazing at the caricature. "That's not
 a bad drawing. I remember Miss Hill never had any use for me.
 Small wonder. She was an honest-to-God teacher. I think she
 wanted us to be good.... Wonder how she got along with the kids
 that came after us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I saw Amanda Hill the other day," spoke up Flossie. "She looked
 worn out. She was nice to me. I'll bet my shirt she'd like to
 have us back, bad as we were.... These kids of to-day! My Gawd!
 they're the limit. They paralyze <i>me</i>. I thought I was
 pretty fast. But compared to these youngsters I'm tied to a post.
 My kid sister Joyce?Rose Clymer?Bessy Bell!... Some
 kids, believe me. And take it from me, girls, these dimple-kneed
 chickens are vamping the older boys."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're all stuck on Bessy," said Helen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret squealed in delight. "Girls, look here. Valentines! Did
 you ever?... Look at them.... And what's this?... 'Wonders of
 Nature?composition by Margaret Maynard.' Heavens! Did I
 write that? And what's this sear and yellow document?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A slivery peal of laughter burst from Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dal, here's one of your masterpieces, composed when you were
 thirteen, and mooney over Daren Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I? Never! I didn't write it," denied Dorothy, with color in her
 dark cheeks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes you did. It's signed?'Yours forever Dot Dalrymple.'
 ... Besides I remember now Daren gave it to me. Said he wanted to
 prove he could have other girls if he couldn't have me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How chivalrous!" exclaimed Dorothy, joining in the laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! here's what I've been hunting," declared Margaret, waving
 aloft a small picture. "It's a photograph of Holt, taken five
 years ago. Only the other evening he swore I hadn't kept
 it?dared me to produce it. He'll want it now?for some
 other girl. But nix, it's mine.... Dal, isn't he a handsome boy
 here?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With sisterly impartiality Dorothy declared she could not in the
 wildest flight of her imagination see her brother as handsome.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holt used to be good-looking," said she. "But he outgrew it.
 That South Carolina training camp and the flu changed his looks
 as well as his disposition."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holt <i>is</i> changed," mused Margaret, gazing down at the
 picture, and the glow faded from her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare Lane is handsome, even if he is a wreck," said Elinor, with
 sudden enthusiasm. "Friday night when he beat it from Fanchon's
 party he sure looked splendid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Elinor was a staunch admirer of Lane's and she was the inveterate
 torment of her girl friends. She gave Helen a sly glance. Helen's
 green eyes narrowed and gleamed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Dare's handsomer than ever," she said. "And to give the
 devil his due he's <i>finer</i> than ever. Too damn fine for this
 crowd!... But what's the use?" she broke off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, poor Dare Lane!" sighed Elinor. "Dare deserves much from
 all of us, not to mention <i>you</i>. He has made me think. Thank
 Heaven, I found I hadn't forgotten how."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "El, no one would notice it," returned Helen, sarcastically.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's easy to see where you get off," retorted Elinor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then a silence ensued, strange in view of the late banter and
 quick sallies; a silence breathing of restraint. The color died
 wholly from Margaret's face, and a subtle, indefinable, almost
 imperceptible change came over Dorothy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet Dare is handsome," spoke up Flossie, as if to break the
 embarrassment. "He's so <i>white</i> since he came home. His eyes
 are so dark and flashing. Then the way he holds his
 head?the look of him.... No wonder these damned slackers
 seem cheap compared to him.... I'd fall for Dare Lane in a
 minute, even if he is half dead."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The restraint passed, and when Floss Dickerson came out with
 eulogy for any man his status was settled for good and all.
 Margaret plunged once more into her treasures of early
 schooldays. Floss and Elinor made merry over some verses Margaret
 had handed up with a blush. Helen apparently lapsed into a
 brooding abstraction. And presently Dorothy excused herself, and
 kissing Margaret good-bye, left for home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The instant she had gone Margaret's gay and reminiscent mood
 underwent a change.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Girls, I want to know what Daren Lane did or said on Friday
 night at Fanchon's," spoke up Margaret. "You know mother dragged
 me home. Said I was tired. But I wasn't. It was only because I'm
 a wall-flower.... So I missed what happened. But I've heard talk
 enough to make me crazy to know about this scandal. Kit Benson
 was here and she hinted things. I met Bessy Bell. She asked me if
 I knew. She's wild about Daren. That yellow-legged broiler! He
 doesn't even know her.... My brother Blair would not tell me
 anything. He's strong for Daren. But mother told me Daren had
 lost his standing in Middleville. She always hated Daren. Afraid
 I'd fall in love with him. The idea! I liked him, and I like him
 better now?poor fellow!... And last, when El mentioned
 Daren, did you see Dal's face? I never saw Dal look like that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Neither did I," replied Elinor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I have," spoke up Helen, with all of her mother's
 bluntness. "Dal always was love-sick over Daren, when she was a
 mere kid. She never got over it and never will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Still water runs deep," sapiently remarked Elinor. "There's a
 good deal in Dal. She's fine as silk. Of course we all remember
 how jealous she was of other girls when Daren went with her. But
 I think now it's because she's sorry for Daren. So am I. He was
 such a fool. Fanchon swears no nice girl in Middleville will ever
 dance that new camel-walk dance in public again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What did Daren say?" demanded Margaret, with eyes lighting.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was standing with Helen, and Fanchon when Daren came up. He
 looked?I don't know how?just wonderful. We all knew
 something was doing. Daren bowed to Fanchon and said to her in a
 perfectly clear voice that everybody heard: 'I'd like to try your
 camel-walk. I'm out of practice and not strong, but I can go once
 around, I'm sure. Will you?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're on, Dare," replied Fanchon.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then he asked. 'Do you like it?'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'I'll say so, Dare?crazy about it.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course you know why it's danced?and how it's
 interpreted by men," said Daren.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean?" asked Fanchon, growing red and flustered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then Daren said: 'I'll tell your mother. If she lets you dance
 with that understanding?all right.' He bent over Mrs. Smith
 and said something. Mrs. Wrapp heard it. And so did Mrs. Mackay,
 who looked pretty sick. Mrs. Smith nearly <i>fainted</i>!... but
 she recovered enough to order Daren to leave."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know what Daren said?" demanded Margaret, in a frenzy of
 excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. None of the girls know. We can only imagine. That makes it
 worse. If Fanchon knows she won't tell. But it is gossip all over
 town. We'll hear it soon. All the girls in town are imagining.
 It's spread like wildfire. And what <i>do</i> you think, Margie?
 In church?on Sunday?Doctor Wallace spoke of it. He
 mentioned no names. But he said that as the indecent dress and
 obscene dance of the young women could no longer be influenced by
 the home or the church it was well that one young man had the
 daring to fling the truth into the faces of their mothers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, it was rotten of Daren," replied Margaret, with tears in her
 eyes. She was ashamed, indignant, incredulous. "For him to do a
 thing like that! He's always been the very prince of gentlemen.
 What on earth possessed him? Heaven knows the dances are vile,
 but that doesn't excuse Daren Lane. What do I care what Doctor
 Wallace said? Never in a thousand years will Mrs. Smith or mother
 or any one forgive him. Fanchon Smith is a little snob. I always
 hated her. She's spiteful and catty. She's a flirt all the way.
 She would dance any old thing. But that's not the point. Daren's
 disgraced himself. It was rotten?of him. And?I'll
 never?forgive?him, either."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't cry, Margie," said Elinor. "It always makes your eyes red
 and gives you a headache. Poor Daren made a blunder. But some of
 us will stick to him. Don't take it so badly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margie, it was rotten of Daren, one way you look at it?our
 way," added Flossie. "But you have to hand it to him for that
 stunt."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen Wrapp preserved her sombre mood, silent and brooding.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margie," went on Elinor, "there's a lot back of this. If Dare
 Lane could do that there must be some reason for it. Maybe we all
 needed a jolt. Well, we've got it. Let's stand by Daren. I will.
 Helen will. Floss will. You will. And surely Dal will."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If you ask <i>me</i> I'll say Dare Lane ought to hand something
 to the men!" burst out Floss Dickerson, with fire in her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You said a mouthful, kiddo," responded Helen, with her narrow
 contracted gaze upon Margaret. "Daren gave me the once
 over?and then the icepick!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wonder what he gave poor Mel?when he heard about her,"
 murmured Elinor, thoughtfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel Iden ought to be roasted," retorted Helen. "She was always
 so darned superior. And all the time ..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, don't you say a word against Mel Iden," burst out
 Margaret, hotly. "She was my dearest friend. She was lovely. Her
 ruin was a horrible shock. But it wasn't because she was bad....
 Mel had some fanatical notion about soldiers giving
 all?going away to be slaughtered. She said to me, 'A
 woman's body is so little to give,'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know Mel was cracked," replied Helen. "But she needn't
 have been a damn fool. She didn't need to have had that baby!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Helen, your idea of sin is to be found out," said Elinor, with
 satire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again Floss Dickerson dropped her trenchant personality into the
 breach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, come off!" she ejaculated. "Let somebody roast the men once,
 will you? I'm the little Jane that <i>knows</i>, believe me. All
 this talk about the girls going to hell makes me sick. We may be
 going?and going in limousines?but it's the men who're
 stepping on the gas."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Floss, I love to hear you elocute," drawled Helen. "Go to it!
 For God's sake, roast the men."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You always have to horn in," retorted Floss. "Let me get this
 off my chest, will you?... We girls are getting talked about.
 There's no use denying it. Any but a blind girl could see it. And
 it's because we do what the men want. Every girl wants to go
 out?to be attractive?to have fellows. But the price
 is getting high. They say in Middleville that I'm rushed more
 than any other girl. Well, if I am I know what it costs.... If I
 didn't 'pet'?if I didn't mush, if I didn't park my corsets
 at dances?if I didn't drink and smoke, and wiggle like a
 jelly-fish, I'd be a dead one?an egg, and don't you
 overlook that. If any one says I <i>want</i> to do these things
 he's a fool. But I do love to have good times, and little by
 little I've been drawn on and on.... I've had my troubles staving
 off these fellows. Most of them get half drunk. Some of the girls
 do, too. I never went that far. I always kept my head. I never
 went the limit. But you can bet your sweet life it wasn't their
 fault I didn't fall for them.... I'll say I've had to walk home
 from more than one auto ride. There's something in the gag, 'I
 know she's a good girl because I met her walking home from an
 auto ride.' That's one thing I intend to cut out this
 summer?the auto rides. Nothing doing for little Flossie!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, can't we talk of something else!" complained Margaret,
 wearily, with her hands pressing against her temples.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER VI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard slowly went upstairs and along the hall to her
 daughter's room. Margaret sat listlessly by a window. The girls
 had gone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were going for a long walk," said Mrs. Maynard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm tired," replied Margaret. There was a shadow in her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mother had never understood her daughter. And of late a
 subtle change in Margaret had made her more of a puzzle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, I want to talk seriously with you," she began.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Didn't I tell you I wanted you to break off your?your
 friendship with Holt Dalrymple?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Margaret, with a flush. "I did not?want to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, the thing which concerns you now is?he can't be
 regarded as a possibility for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Possibility?" echoed Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Just that, exactly. I'm not sure of your thoughts on the matter,
 but it's time I knew them. Holt is a ne'er-do-well. He's gone to
 the bad, like so many of these army boys. No nice girl will ever
 associate with him again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I'm not nice, for I will," declared Margaret, spiritedly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will persist in your friendship for him in the face of my
 objection?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly I will if I have any say about it. But I know Holt.
 I?I guess he has taken to drink?and carrying on. So
 you needn't worry much about our friendship."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard hesitated. She had become accustomed to Margaret's
 little bursts of fury and she expected one here. But none came;
 Margaret appeared unnaturally calm; she sat still with her face
 turned to the window. Mrs. Maynard was a little afraid of this
 cold, quiet girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, you can't help seeing now that your mother's judgment
 was right. Holt Dalrymple once may have been very interesting and
 attractive for a friend, but as a prospective husband he was
 impossible. The worst I hear of him is that he drinks and
 gambles. I know you liked him and I don't want to be unjust. But
 he has kept other and better young men away from you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret's hand clenched and her face sank against the
 window-pane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We need say no more about him," went on Mrs. Maynard. "Margaret,
 you've been brought up in luxury. If your father happened to die
 now?he's far from well?we'd be left penniless. We've
 lived up every dollar.... We have our poor crippled Blair to care
 for. You know you must marry well. I've brought you up with that
 end in view. And it's imperative you marry soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why must a girl marry?" murmured Margaret, wistfulness in her
 voice. "I'd rather go to work." "Margaret, you are a Maynard,"
 replied her mother, haughtily. "Pray spare me any of this new
 woman talk about liberty?equal rights?careers and all
 that. Life hasn't changed for the conservative families of
 blood.... Try to understand, Margaret, that you must marry and
 marry well. You're nobody without money. In society there are
 hundreds of girls like you, though few so attractive. That's all
 the more reason you should take the best chance you have, before
 it's lost. If you don't marry people will say you can't. They'll
 say you're fading, growing old, even if you grow prettier every
 day of your life, and in the end they'll make you a miserable old
 maid. Then you'll be glad to marry anybody. If you marry now you
 can help your father, who needs help badly enough. You can help
 poor Blair.... You can be a leader in society; you can have a
 house here, a cottage at the seashore and one in the mountains;
 everything a girl's heart yearns for?servants, horses,
 autos, gowns, diamonds??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Everything except love," interrupted Margaret, bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard actually flushed, but she kept her temper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's desirable that you love your husband. Any sensible woman
 can learn to care for a man. Love, as you dream about it is
 merely a?a dream. If women waited for that they would never
 get married."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Which would be preferable to living without love."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Margaret, what would become of the world? If there were
 fewer marriages?Heaven knows they're few enough
 nowadays?there would be fewer families?and in the end
 fewer children?less and less??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They'd be better children," said Margaret, calmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Eventually the race would die out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And that'd be a good thing?if the people can't love each
 other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How silly?exasperating!" ejaculated Mrs. Maynard. "You
 don't mean such nonsense. What any girl wants is a home of her
 own, a man to fuss over. I didn't marry for love, as you dream
 it. My husband attended to his business and I've looked after his
 household. You've had every advantage. I flatter myself our
 marriage has been a success."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret's eyes gleamed like pointed flames.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I differ with you. Your married life hasn't been successful any
 more than it's been happy. You never cared for father. You
 haven't been kind to him since his failure."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard waved her hand imperiously in angry amaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't stop. I'm not a baby or a doll," went on Margaret,
 passionately. "If I'm old enough to marry I'm old enough to talk.
 I can think, can't I? You never told me anything, but I could
 see. Ever since I can remember you and father have had one
 continual wrangle about money?bills?expenses. Perhaps
 I'd have been better off without all the advantages and luxury.
 It's because of these things you want to throw me at some man.
 I'd far rather go to work the same as Blaid did, instead of
 college."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whatever on earth has come over you?" gasped Mrs. Maynard,
 bewildered by the revolt of this once meek daughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe I'm learning a little sense. Maybe I got some of it from
 Daren Lane," flashed back Margaret.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, whatever I've learned lately has been learned away from
 home. You've no more idea what's going on in the world to-day
 than if you were actually dead. I never was bright like Mel Iden,
 but I'm no fool. I see and hear and I read. Girls aren't pieces
 of furniture to be handed out to some rich men. Girls are waking
 up. They can do things. They can be independent. And being
 independent doesn't mean a girl's not going to marry. For she can
 wait?wait for the right man?for love.... You say I
 dream. Well, why didn't you wake me up long ago?with the
 truth? I had my dreams about love and marriage. And I've learned
 that love and marriage are vastly different from what most
 mothers make them out to be, or let a girl think."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, I'll not have you talk in this strange way. You owe me
 respect if not obedience," said Mrs. Maynard, her voice
 trembling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, well, I won't say any more," replied Margaret, "But can't
 you spare me? Couldn't we live within our means?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all these years?to skimp along! I couldn't endure
 it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whom have you in mind for me to?to marry?" asked the girl,
 coldly curious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Swann has asked your hand in marriage for his son Richard.
 He wants Richard to settle down. Richard is wild, like all these
 young men. And I have?well, I encouraged the plan."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Mother!</i>" cried Margaret, springing up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, you will see"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I despise Dick Swann."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" asked her mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I just do. I never liked him in school. He used to do such mean
 things. He's selfish. He let Holt and Daren suffer for his
 tricks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, you talk like a child."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Listen, mother." She threw her arms round Mrs. Maynard and
 kissed her and spoke pleadingly. "Oh, don't make me hate myself.
 It seems I've grown so much older in the last year or
 so?and lately since this marriage talk came up. I've
 thought of things as never before because I've?I've learned
 about them. I see so differently. I can't?can't love Dick
 Swann. I can't bear to have him touch me. He's rude. He takes
 liberties.... He's too free with his hands! Why, it'd be wrong to
 marry him. What difference can a marriage service make in a
 girl's feelings.... Mother, let me say no."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord spare me from bringing up another girl!" exclaimed Mrs.
 Maynard. "Margaret, I can't make you marry Richard Swann. I'm
 simply trying to tell you what any sensible girl would see she
 had to do. You think it over?both sides of the
 question?before you absolutely decide."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Maynard was glad to end the discussion and to get away. In
 Margaret's appeal she heard a yielding, a final obedience to her
 wish. And she thought she had better let well enough alone. The
 look in Margaret's clear blue eyes made her shrink; it would
 haunt her. But she felt no remorse. Any mother would have done
 the same. There was always the danger of that old love affair;
 there was new danger in these strange wild fancies of modern
 girls; there was never any telling what Margaret might do. But
 once married she would be safe and her position assured.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Daren Lane left Riverside Park, and walked in the meadows until
 he came to a boulder under a huge chestnut tree. Here he sat
 down. He could not walk far these days. Many a time in the Indian
 summers long past he had gathered chestnuts there with Dal, with
 Mel Iden, with Helen. He would never do it again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The April day had been warm and fresh with the opening of a late
 spring. The sun was now gold?rimming the low hills in the
 west; the sky was pale blue; the spring flowers whitened the
 meadow. Twilight began to deepen; the evening star twinkled out
 of the sky; the hush of the gloaming hour stole over the land.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Four weeks home?and nothing done. So little time left!" he
 muttered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two weeks of that period he had been unable to leave his bed. The
 rest of the time he had dragged himself around, trying to live up
 to his resolve, to get at the meaning of the present, to turn his
 sister Lorna from the path of dalliance. And he had failed in
 all.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His sister presented the problem that most distressed Lane. She
 had her good qualities, and through them could be reached. But
 she was thoughtless, vacillating, and wilful. She had made him
 promises only to break them. Lane had caught her in falsehoods.
 And upon being called to account she had told him that if he
 didn't like it he could "lump" it. Of late she had grown away
 from what affection she had shown at first. She could not bear
 interference with her pleasures, and seemed uncontrollable. Lane
 felt baffled. This thing was a Juggernaut impossible to stop.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had scraped acquaintance with Harry Hale, one of Lorna's
 admirers, a boy of eighteen, who lived with his widowed mother on
 the edge of the town. He appeared to be an industrious,
 intelligent, quiet fellow, not much given to the prevailing
 habits of the young people. In his humble worship of Lorna he was
 like a dog. Lorna went to the motion pictures with him
 occasionally, when she had no other opportunity for excitement.
 Lane gathered that Lorna really liked this boy, and when with him
 seemed more natural, more what a fifteen-year-old girl used to
 be. And somehow it was upon this boy that Lane placed a forlorn
 hope.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No more automobiles honked in front of the home to call Lorna
 out. She met her friends away from the house, and returning at
 night she walked the last few blocks. It was this fact that awoke
 Lane's serious suspicions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another problem lay upon Lane's heart; if not so distressing as
 Lorna's, still one that added to his sorrow and his perplexity.
 He had gone once to call on Mel Iden. Mel Iden was all soul.
 Whatever had been the facts of her downfall?and reflection
 on that hurt Lane so strangely he could not bear it?it had
 not been on her part a matter of sex. She was far above
 wantonness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Through long hours in the dark of night, when Lane's pain kept
 him sleepless, he had pondered over the mystery of Mel Iden until
 it cleared. She typified the mother of the race. In all periods
 of the progress of the race, war had brought out this instinct in
 women?to give themselves for the future. It was a provision
 of nature, inscrutable and terrible. How immeasurable the
 distance between Mel Iden and those women who practised birth
 control! As the war had brought out hideous greed and baseness,
 so had it propelled forward and upward the noblest attributes of
 life. Mel Iden was a builder, not a destroyer. She had been
 sexless and selfless. Unconsciously during the fever and emotion
 of the training of American men for service abroad, and the
 poignancy of their departure, to fight, and perhaps never return,
 Mel Iden had answered to this mysterious instinct of nature.
 Then, with the emotion past, and face to face with staggering
 consequences, she had reacted to conscious instincts. She had
 proved the purity of her surrender. She was all mother. And Lane
 began to see her moving in a crystal, beautiful light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For what seemed a long time Lane remained motionless there in the
 silence of the meadow. Then at length he arose and retraced his
 slow steps back to town. Darkness overtook him on the bridge that
 spanned Middleville River. He leaned over the railing and peered
 down into the shadows. A soft murmur of rushing water came up.
 How like strange distant voices calling him to go back or go on,
 or warning him, or giving mystic portent of something that would
 happen to him there! A cold chill crept over him and he seemed
 enveloped in a sombre menace of the future. But he shook it off.
 He had many battles to fight, not the least of which was with
 morbid imagination.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he reached the center of town he entered the lobby of the
 Bradford Inn. He hoped to meet Blair Maynard there. A company of
 well-dressed youths and men filled the place, most of whom
 appeared to be making a merry uproar.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane observed two men who evidently were the focus of attention.
 One was a stranger, very likely a traveling man, and at the
 moment he presented a picture of mingled consternation and anger.
 He was brushing off his clothes while glaring at a little, stout,
 red-faced man who appeared about to be stricken by apoplexy. This
 latter was a Colonel Pepper, whose acquaintance Lane had recently
 made. He was fond of cards and sport, and appeared to be a
 favorite with the young men about town. Moreover he had made
 himself particularly agreeable to Lane, in fact to the extent of
 Lane's embarrassment. At this moment the stranger lost his
 consternation wholly in wrath, and made a threatening movement
 toward Pepper. Lane stepped between them just in time to save
 Pepper a blow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know what he's done. I apologize for him," said Lane, to the
 stranger. "He's made a good many people victims of the same
 indignity. It's a weakness?a disease. He can't help
 himself. Pray overlook it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stranger appeared impressed with Lane's presence, probably
 with his uniform, and slowly shook himself and fell back, to
 glower at Pepper, and curse under his breath, still uncertain of
 himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane grasped Colonel Pepper and led him out of the lobby.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pepper, you're going to get in an awful mess with that stunt of
 yours," he declared, severely. "If you can't help it you ought at
 least pick on your friends, or the town people?not
 strangers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have?a?drink," sputtered Pepper, with his hand at
 his hip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thanks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have?a?cigar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane laughed. He had been informed that Colonel Pepper's failing
 always took this form of remorse, and certainly he would have
 tried it upon his latest victim had not Lane interfered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Colonel, you're hopeless," said Lane, as they walked out. "I
 hope somebody will always be around to protect you. I'd carry a
 body guard.... Say, have you seen Blair Maynard or Holt Dalrymple
 to-night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not Blair, but Holt was here early with the boys," replied
 Pepper. "They've gone to the club rooms to have a little game.
 I'm going to sit in. Lately I had to put up a holler. If the boys
 quit cards how'm I to make a living?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Had Holt been drinking?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not to-night. But he's been hitting the bottle pretty hard of
 late."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly Lane buttonholed the little man and peered down
 earnestly at him. "Pepper, I've been trying to straighten Holt
 up. He's going to the bad. But he's a good kid. It's only the
 company.... The fact is?this's strictly confidential, mind
 you?Holt's sister begged me to try to stop his drinking and
 gambling. I think I can do it, too, with a little help. Now,
 Pepper, I'm asking you to help me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh! Well, let's go in the writing room, where we can talk,"
 said the other, and he took hold of Lane's arm. When they were
 seated in a secluded corner he lighted a cigar, and faced Lane
 with shrewd, kindly eyes. "Son, I like you and Blair as well as I
 hate these slackers Swann and Mackay, and their crowd. I could
 tell you a heap, and maybe help you, though I think young Holt is
 not a bad egg.... Is his sister the dark one who steps so
 straight and holds herself so well?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that sounds like Dorothy," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's about the only one I know who doesn't paint her face and I
 never saw her at?well, never mind where. But the fact I
 mean makes her stand out in this Middleville crowd like a light
 in the dark.... Lane, have you got on yet to the speed of the
 young people of this old burg?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm getting on, to my sorrow," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh! You mean you're getting wise to your kid sister?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I'm sorry to say. What do you know, Pepper?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, son, wait. I'm coming to that, maybe. But I want to know
 some things first. Is it true?what I hear about your
 health, bad shape, you know?all cut up in the war? Worse
 than young Maynard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pepper's hand was close on Lane's. He had forgotten his cigar.
 His eyes were earnest.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "True?" laughed Lane, grimly. "Yes, it's true.... I won't last
 long, Pepper, according to Doctor Bronson. That's why I want to
 make hay while the sun shines."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh!" Pepper cleared his throat. "Forgive this, boy.... Is it
 also true you were engaged to marry that Helen Wrapp?and
 she threw you down, while you were over there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, that's perfectly true," replied Lane, soberly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God, I guess maybe the soldier wasn't up against it!" ejaculated
 Pepper, with a gesture of mingled awe and wonder and scorn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What was the soldier up against, Pepper?" queried Lane.
 "Frankly, I don't know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, the government jollied and forced the boys into the army,"
 replied Pepper. "The country went wild with patriotism. The
 soldiers were heroes. The women threw themselves away on anything
 inside a uniform. Make the world safe for democracy?down
 the Hun?save France and England?ideals, freedom,
 God's country, and all that! Well, the first few soldiers to
 return from France got a grand reception, were made heroes of.
 They were lucky to get back while the sentiment was hot. But that
 didn't last.... Now, a year and more after the war, where does
 the soldier get off? Lane, there're over six hundred thousand of
 you disabled veterans, and for all I can read and find out the
 government has done next to nothing. New York is full of begging
 soldiers?on the streets. Think of it! And the poor devils
 are dying everywhere. My God! think of what's in the mind of one
 crippled soldier, let alone over half a million. I just have a
 dim idea of what I'd felt. You must know, or you will know, Lane,
 for you seem a thoughtful, lofty sort of chap. Just the kind to
 make a good soldier, because you had ideals and nerve!... Well, a
 selfish and weak administration could hardly be expected to keep
 extravagant promises to patriots. But that the American public,
 as a body, should now be sick of the sight of a crippled
 soldier?and that his sweetheart should turn him
 down!?this is the hideous blot, the ineradicable shame, the
 stinking truth, the damned mystery!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Pepper ended his speech, which grew more vehement toward the
 close, Lane could only stare at him in amaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See here, Lane," added the other hastily, "pardon me for blowing
 up. I just couldn't help it. I took a shine to you?and to
 see you like this?brings back the resentment I've had all
 along. I'm blunt, but it's just as well for you to be put wise
 quick. You'll find friends, like me, who will stand by you, if
 you let them. But you'll also find that most of this rotten world
 has gone back on you...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Pepper made a sharp, passionate gesture that broke his cigar
 against the arm of his chair, and he cursed low and deep.
 Presently he addressed Lane again. "Whatever comes of any
 disclosures I make?whatever you <i>do</i>?you'll not
 give me away?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly not. You can trust me, Pepper," returned Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Son, I'm a wise old guy. There's not much that goes on in
 Middleville I don't get on to. And I'll make your hair curl. But
 I'll confine myself to what comes closest home to you. I
 <i>get</i> you, Lane. You're game. You're through. You have come
 back from war to find a hell of a mess. Your own
 sister?your sweetheart?your friend's brother and your
 soldier pard's sister?on the primrose path! And you with
 your last breath trying to turn them back! I'll say it's a damn
 fine stunt. I'm an old gambler, Lane. I've lived in many towns
 and mixed in tough crowds of crooked men and rotten women. But
 I'm here to confess that this after-the-war stuff of
 Middleville's better class has knocked out about all the faith I
 had left in human nature.... Then you came along to teach me a
 lesson."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Pepper, that's strong talk," returned Lane. "But cut it,
 and hurry to?to what comes home to me. What's the matter
 with these Middleville girls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, any intelligent man, who <i>knows</i> things, and who can
 think for himself, will tell you this?that to judge from
 the dress, dance, talk, conduct of these young girls?most
 of them have <i>apparently</i> gone wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You include our nice girls?from what we used to call
 Middleville's best families?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't only include them. I throw the emphasis on them. The
 girls you know best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane straightened up, to look at his companion. Pepper certainly
 was not drunk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know?anything about Lorna?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing specifically to prove anything. She's in the thick of
 this thing in Middleville. Only a few nights ago I saw her at a
 roadhouse, out on the State Road, with a crowd of youngsters.
 They were having a high old time, I'll say. They danced jazz, and
 I saw Lorna drink lemonade into which liquor had been poured from
 a hip-pocket flask."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane put his head on his hands, as if to rest it, or still the
 throbbing there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who took Lorna to this place?" he asked, presently, breathing
 heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know. But it was Dick Swann who poured the drink out of
 the flask. Between you and me, Lane, that young millionaire is
 going a pace hereabouts. Listen," he went on, lowering his voice,
 and glancing round to see there was no one to overhear him,
 "there's a gambling club in Middleville. I go there. My rooms are
 in the same building. I've made a peep-hole through the attic
 floor next to my room. Do I see more things than cards and
 bottles? Do I! If the fathers of Middleville could see what I've
 seen they'd go out to the asylum.... I'm not supposed to know
 it's more than a place to gamble. And nobody knows I know. Dick
 Swann and Hardy Mackay are at the head of this club. Swann is the
 genius and the support of it. He's rich, and a high roller if I
 ever saw one.... Among themselves these young gentlemen call it
 the Strong Arm Club. Study over that, Lane. Do you <i>get</i> it?
 I know you do, and that saves me talking until I see red."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pepper, have you seen my sister?there?" queried Lane,
 tensely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With whom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll not say, Lane. There's no need for that. I'll give you a
 key to my rooms, and you can go there?in the
 afternoons?and paste yourself to my peep-hole, and
 watch.... Honest to God, I believe it means bloodshed. But I
 can't help that. Something must be done. I'm not much good, but I
 can see that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Pepper wiped his moist face. He was now quite pale and
 his hands shook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never had a wife, or a sweetheart," he went on. "But once I
 had a little sister. Thank Heaven she didn't live her girlhood in
 times like these."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane again bowed his head on his hands, and wrestled with the
 might of reality.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm going to take you to these club-rooms to-night," went on
 Pepper. "It'll cause a hell of a row. But once you get in,
 there'll be no help for them. Swann and his chums will have to
 stand for it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you ever take an outsider in?" asked Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Several times. Traveling men I met here. Good fellows that liked
 a game of cards. Swann made no kick at that. He's keen to gamble.
 And when he's drinking the sky's the limit."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wouldn't it be wiser just to show me these rooms, and let me
 watch from your place?until I find my sister there?"
 queried Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know," replied Pepper, thoughtfully. "I think if I were
 you I'd butt in to-night with me. You can drag young Dalrymple
 home before he gets drunk".
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pepper, I'll break up this?this club," declared Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say you will. And I'm for you strong. If it was only the
 booze and cards I'd not have squealed. That's my living. But by
 God, I can't stand for the?the other stuff any longer!...
 Come on now. And I'll put you on to a slick stunt that'll take
 your breath away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He led the way out of the hotel, in his excitement walking rather
 fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go slow, Pepper," said Lane. "We're not going over the top."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pepper gave him a quick, comprehending look.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good Lord, Lane, you're not as?as bad as all that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane nodded. Then at slower pace they went out and down the
 bright Main Street for two blocks, and then to the right on West
 Street, which was quite comparable to the other thoroughfare as a
 business district. At the end of the street the buildings were
 the oldest in Middleville, and entirely familiar to Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Give White's the once over," said Pepper, indicating a brightly
 lighted store across the street. "That place is new to you, isn't
 it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I don't remember White, or that there was a confectionery
 den along here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Den is right. It's some den, believe me.... White's a
 newcomer?a young sport, thick with Swann. For all I know
 Swann is backing him. Anyway he has a swell joint and a good
 trade. People kick about his high prices. Ice cream, candy, soda,
 soft drinks, and all that rot. But if he knows who you are you
 can get a shot. It'll strike you funny later to see he waits on
 the customers himself. But when you get wise it'll not be so
 funny. He's got a tea parlor upstairs?and they say it's
 some swell place, with a rest room or ladies' dressing room back.
 Now from this back room the girls can get into the club-rooms of
 the boys, and go out on the other side of the block. In one way
 and out the other?at night. Not necessary in the
 afternoon.... Come on now, well go round the block."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A short walk round the block brought them into a shaded, wide
 street with one of Middleville's parks on the left. A row of
 luxuriant elm trees helped the effect of gloom. The nearest
 electric light was across on the far corner, with trees obscuring
 it to some extent. At the corner where Pepper halted there was an
 outside stairway running up the old-fashioned building. The
 ground floor shops bore the signs of a florist and a milliner;
 above was a photograph gallery; and the two upper stories were
 apparently unoccupied. To the left of the two stores another
 stairway led up into the center of the building. Pepper led Lane
 up this stairway, a long, dark climb of three stories that taxed
 Lane's endurance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure is a junk heap, this old block," observed Pepper, as he
 fumbled in the dim light with his keys. At length he opened a
 door, turned on a light and led Lane into his apartment. "I have
 three rooms here, and the back one opens into a kind of areaway
 from which I get into an abandoned storeroom, or I guess it's an
 attic. To-morrow afternoon about three you meet me here and I'll
 take you in there and let you have a look through the peep-hole I
 made. It's no use to-night, because there'll be only boys at the
 club, and I'm going to take you right in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He switched off the light, drew Lane out and locked the door.
 "I'm the only person who lives on this floor. There're three
 holes to this burrow and one of them is at the end of this hall.
 The exit where the girls slip out is on the floor below, through
 a hallway to that outside stairs. Oh, I'll say it's a Coney
 Island maze, this building! But just what these young rakes
 want.... Come on, and be careful. It'll be dark and the stairs
 are steep."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the end of the short hall Pepper opened a door, and led Lane
 down steep steps in thick darkness, to another hall, dimly
 lighted by a window opening upon the street.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll have to make a bluff at playing poker, unless my butting
 in with you causes a row," said Pepper, as he walked along.
 Presently he came to a door upon which he knocked several times.
 But before it was opened footsteps and voices sounded down the
 hall in the opposite direction from which Pepper had escorted
 Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Guess they're just coming. Hard luck," said Pepper. "'Fraid
 you'll not get in now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane counted five dark forms against the background of dim light.
 He saw the red glow of a cigarette. Then the door upon which
 Pepper had knocked opened to let out a flare. Pepper gave Lane a
 shove across the threshold and followed him. Lane did not
 recognize the young man who had opened the door. The room was
 large, with old walls and high ceiling, a round table with chairs
 and a sideboard. It had no windows. The door on the other side
 was closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pepper, who's this you're ringin' in on me?" demanded the young
 fellow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A pard of mine. Now don't be peeved, Sammy," replied Pepper. "If
 there's any kick I'll take the blame.
</p><br>

<p>

Then the five young men glided swiftly into the room. The last one was
Dick Swann. In the act of closing the door behind him, he saw Lane, and
started violently back. His face turned white. His action, his look
silenced the talk.
</p><br>

<p>
"Lane! What do you want?" he jerked out.
</p><br>

<p>
Lane eyed him without replying. He thought he read more in Swann's face
and voice than any of the amazed onlookers.
</p><br>

<p>
"Dick, I fetched Lane up for a little game," put in Pepper, with
composure.
</p><br>

<p>
Swann jerked as violently out of his stiffened posture as he had frozen
into it. His face changed--showed comprehension--relief--then flamed
with anger.
</p><br>

<p>
"Pepper, it's a damn high-handed imposition for you to bring strangers
here," he burst out.
</p><br>

<p>
"Well, I'm sorry you take it that way," replied Pepper, with deprecatory
spreading of his hands. He was quite cool and his little eyes held a
singular gleam. "You never kicked before when I brought a stranger."
</p><br>

<p>
Swann fiercely threw down his cigarette.
</p><br>

<p>
"Hell! I told you never to bring any Middleville man in here."
</p><br>

<p>
"Ahuh! I forgot. You'll have to excuse me," returned Pepper, not with
any particular regret.
</p><br>

<p>
"What's the matter with my money?" queried Lane, ironically, at last
removing his steady gaze from Swann to the others. Mackay was there, and
Holt Dalrymple, the boy in whom Lane had lately interested himself. Holt
resembled his sister in his dark rich coloring, but his face wore a
shade of sullen depression. The other two young men Lane had seen in
Middleville, but they were unknown to him.
</p><br>

<p>
"Pepper, you beat it with your new pard," snarled Swarm. "And you'll not
get in here again, take that from me."
</p><br>

<p>
The mandate nettled Pepper, who evidently felt more deeply over this
situation than had appeared on the surface.
</p><br>

<p>
"Sure, I'll beat it," returned he, resentfully. "But see here, Swann. Be
careful how you shoot off your dirty mouth. It's not beyond me to hand a
little tip to my friend Chief of Police Bell."
</p><br>

<p>
"You damned squealer!" shouted Swann. "Go ahead--do your worst. You'll
find I pull a stroke.... Now get out of here."
</p><br>

<p>
With a violent action he shoved the little man out into the hall. Then
turning to Lane he pointed with shaking hand to the door.
</p><br>

<p>
"Lane, you couldn't be a guest of mine."
</p><br>

<p>
"Swann, I certainly wouldn't be," retorted Lane, in tones that rang.
"Pepper didn't tell me you were the proprietor of this--this joint."
</p><br>

<p>
"Get out of here or I'll throw you out!" yelled Swann, now beside
himself with rage. And he made a threatening move toward Lane.
</p><br>

<p>
"Don't lay a hand on me," replied Lane. "I don't want my uniform
soiled."</p><br>

<p>With that Lane turned to Dalrymple, and said quietly: "Holt, I came here
to find you, not to play cards. That was a stall. Come away with me. You
were not cut out for a card sharp or a booze fighter.
What's got into you that
 you can gamble and drink with <i>slackers</i>?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dalrymple jammed his hat on and stepped toward the door. "Dare,
 you said a lot. I'll beat it with you?and I'll never come
 back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet your sweet life you won't," shouted Swann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hold on there, Dalrymple," interposed Mackay, stepping out.
 "Come across with that eighty-six bucks you owe me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I haven't got it, Mackay," rejoined the boy, flushing
 deeply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane ripped open his coat and jerked out his pocket-book and tore
 bills out of it. "There, Hardy Mackay," he said, with deliberate
 scorn, throwing the money on the table. "There are your
 eighty-six dollars?<i>earned</i> in France.... I should
 think it'd burn your fingers."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He drew Holt out into the hall, where Pepper waited. Some one
 slammed the door and began to curse.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That ends that," said Colonel Pepper, as the three moved down
 the dim hall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ends us, Pepper, but you couldn't stop those guys with a
 crowbar," retorted Dalrymple.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane linked arms with the boy and changed the conversation while
 they walked back to the inn. Here Colonel Pepper left them, and
 Lane talked to Holt for an hour. The more he questioned Holt the
 better he liked him, and yet the more surprised was he at the
 sordid fact of the boy's inclination toward loose living. There
 was something perhaps that Holt would not confess. His health had
	 been impaired in the service, but not seriously. He was getting
 stronger all the time. His old job was waiting for him. His
 mother and sister had enough to live on, but if he had been
 working he could have helped them in a way to afford him great
 satisfaction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holt, listen," finally said Lane, with more earnestness. "We're
 friends?all boys of the service are friends. We might even
 become great pards, if we had time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's time got to do with it?" queried the younger man. "I'm
 sure I'd like it?and know it'd help me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm shot to pieces, Holt.... I won't last long...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aw, Lane, don't say that!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's true. And if I'm to help you at all it must be now.... You
 haven't told me everything, boy?now have you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holt dropped his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say?I haven't," he replied, haltingly.
 "Lane?the trouble is?I'm clean gone on Margie
 Maynard. But her mother hates the sight of me. She won't stand
 for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oho! So that's it?" ejaculated Lane, a light breaking in upon
 him. "Well, I'll be darned. It <i>is</i> serious, Holt.... Does
 Margie love you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure she does. We've always cared. Don't you remember how Margie
 and I and Dal and you used to go to school together? And come
 home together? And play on Saturdays?... Ever since then!... But
 lately Margie and I are?we got?pretty badly mixed
 up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I remember those days," replied Lane, dreamily, and
 suddenly he recalled Dal's dark eyes, somehow haunting. He had to
 make an effort to get back to the issue at hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Margie loves you?why it's all right. Go back to work
 and marry her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, it can't be all right. Mrs. Maynard has handed me the
 mitt," replied Holt, bitterly. "And Margie hasn't the courage to
 run off with me.... Her mother is throwing Margie at
 Swann?because he's rich."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh Lord, no?Holt?you can't mean <i>it</i>!"
 exclaimed Lane, aghast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say I do mean it. I <i>know</i> it," returned Holt,
 moodily. "So I let go?fell into the dumps?didn't care
 a d?? what became of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was genuinely shocked. What a tangle he had fallen upon!
 Once again there seemed to confront him a colossal Juggernaut, a
 moving, crushing, intangible thing, beyond his power to cope
 with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, what can I do?" queried Holt, in sudden hope his friend
 might see a way out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Despairingly, Lane racked his brain for some word of advice or
 assurance, if not of solution. But he found none. Then his spirit
 mounted, and with it passion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holt, don't be a miserable coward," he began, in fierce scorn.
 "You're a soldier, man, and you've got your life to
 <i>live</i>!... The sun will rise?the days will be long and
 pleasant?you can work?<i>do</i> something. You can
 fish the streams in summer and climb the hills in autumn. You can
 enjoy. Bah! don't tell me one shallow girl means the world. If
 Margie hasn't courage enough to run off and marry
 you?<i>let her go!</i> But you can never tell. Maybe Margie
 will stick to you. I'll help you. Margie and I have always been
 friends and I'll try to influence her. Then think of your mother
 and sister. Work for <i>them</i>. Forget yourself?your
 little, miserable, selfish desires.... My God, boy, but it's a
 strange life the war's left us to face. I <i>hate</i> it. So do
 you hate it. Swann and Mackay giving nothing and getting all! ...
 So it looks.... But it's false?false. God did not intend
 men to live solely for their bodies. A balance <i>must</i> be
 struck. They have <i>got</i> to pay. Their time will come.... As
 for you, the harder this job is the fiercer you should be. I've
 got to die, Holt. But if I could live I'd show these slackers,
 these fickle wild girls, what they're doing.... You can do it,
 Holt. It's the greatest part any man could be called upon to
 play. It will prove the difference between you and them...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holt Dalrymple crushed Lane's hand in both his own. On his face
 was a glow?his dark eyes flashed: "Lane?that'll be
 about all," he burst out with a kind of breathlessness. Then his
 head high, he stalked out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day was bad. Lane suffered from both over-exertion and
 intensity of emotion. He remained at home all day, in bed most of
 the time. At supper time he went downstairs to find Lorna
 pirouetting in a new dress, more abbreviated at top and bottom
 than any costume he had seen her wear. The effect struck him at
 an inopportune time. He told her flatly that she looked like a
 French grisette of the music halls, and ought to be ashamed to be
 seen in such attire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I don't think you're a good judge of clothes these days,"
 she observed, complacently. "The boys will say I look spiffy in
 this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So many times Lorna's trenchant remarks silenced Lane. She hit
 the nail on the head. Practical, logical, inevitable were some of
 her speeches. She knew what men wanted. That was the pith of her
 meaning. What else mattered?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Lorna, suppose you don't look nice?" he questioned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I <i>do</i> look nice," she retorted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't look anything of the kind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's nice? It's only a word. It doesn't mean much in my young
 life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where are you going to-night?" he asked, sitting down to the
 table.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To the armory?basketball game?and dance afterward."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With whom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With Harry. I suppose that pleases you, big brother?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it does. I like him. I wish he'd take you out oftener."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Take</i> me! Hot dog! He'd kill himself to take me all the
 time. But Harry's slow. He bores me. Then he hasn't got a car."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna, you may as well know now that I'm going to stop your car
 rides," said Lane, losing his patience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You are <i>not</i>," she retorted, and in the glint of the eyes
 meeting his, Lane saw his defeat. His patience was exhausted, his
 fear almost verified. He did not mince words. With his mother
 standing open-mouthed and shocked, Lane gave his sister to
 understand what he thought of automobile rides, and that as far
 as she was concerned they had to be stopped. If she would not
 stop them out of respect to her mother and to him, then he would
 resort to other measures. Lorna bounced up in a fury, and in the
 sharp quarrel that followed, Lane realized he was dealing with
 flint full of fire. Lorna left without finishing her supper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, that's not the way," said his mother, shaking her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What is the way, mother?" he asked, throwing up his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know, unless it's to see her way," responded the mother.
 "Sometimes I feel so?so old-fashioned and ignorant before
 Lorna. Maybe she is right. How can we tell? What makes all the
 young girls like that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What indeed, wondered Lane! The question had been hammering at
 his mind for over a month. He went back to bed, weary and
 dejected, suffering spasms of pain, like blades, through his
 lungs, and grateful for the darkness. Almost he wished it was all
 over?this ordeal. How puny his efforts! Relentlessly life
 marched on. At midnight he was still fighting his pangs, still
 unconquered. In the night his dark room was not empty. There were
 faces, shadows, moving images and pictures, scenes of the war
 limned against the blackness. At last he rested, grew as free
 from pain as he ever grew, and slept. In the morning it was
 another day, and the past was as if it were not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 May the first dawned ideally springlike, warm, fresh, fragrant,
 with birds singing, sky a clear blue, and trees budding green and
 white.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane yielded to an impulse that had grown stronger of late. His
 steps drew him to the little drab house where Mel Iden lived with
 her aunt. On the way, which led past a hedge, Lane gathered a
 bunch of violets.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
 love,'" he mused. "It's good, even for <i>me</i>, to be alive
 this morning.... These violets, the birds, the fresh smells, the
 bursting green! Oh, well, regrets are idle. But just to
 think?I had to go through all I've known?right down
 to this moment?to realize how stingingly sweet life is...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel answered his knock, and sight of her face seemed to lift his
 heart with an unwonted throb. Had he unconsciously needed that?
 The thought made his greeting, and the tender of the violets,
 awkward for him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it was good of you to gather
 them for me. I remember.... But I told you not to come again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I know you did," he replied. "But I've disobeyed you. I
 wanted to see you, Mel.... I didn't know how badly until I got
 here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You should not want to see me at all. People will talk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you care what people say of you?" he questioned, feigning
 surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of me? No. I was thinking of you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You fear the poison tongues for me? Well, they cannot harm me.
 I'm beyond tongues or minds like those."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She regarded him earnestly, with serious gravity and slowly
 dawning apprehension; then, turning to arrange the violets in a
 tiny vase, she shook her head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you're beyond me, too. I feel a?a change in you.
 Have you had another sick spell?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only for a day off and on. I'm really pretty well to-day. But I
 have changed. I feel that, yet I don't know how."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could talk to her. She stirred him, drew him out of himself.
 He felt a strange desire for her sympathy, and a keen curiosity
 concerning her opinions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I thought maybe you'd been ill again or perhaps upset by the
 consequences of your?your action at Fanchon Smith's party."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told you of that?" he asked in surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dal. She was here yesterday. She will come in spite of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So will I," interposed Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shook her head. "No, it's different for a man.... I've missed
 the girls. No one but Dal ever comes. I thought Margie would be
 true to me?no matter what had befallen.... Dal comes, and
 oh, Daren, she is good. She helps me so.... She told me what you
 did at Fanchon's party."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She did! Well, what's your verdict?" he queried, grimly. "That
 break queered me in Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I agree with what Doctor Wallace said to his congregation,"
 returned Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Lane met the blue fire of her eyes he experienced another
 singularly deep and profound thrill, as if the very depths of him
 had been stirred. He seemed to have suddenly discovered Mel Iden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor Wallace did back me up," said Lane, with a smile. "But no
 one else did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't be so sure of that. Harsh conditions require harsh
 measures. Dal said you killed the camel-walk dance in
 Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It surely was a disgusting sight," returned Lane, with a
 grimace. "Mel, I just saw red that night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren," she asked wistfully, following her own train of thought,
 "do you know that most of the girls consider me an outcast?
 Fanchon rides past me with her head up in the air. Helen Wrapp
 cuts me. Margie looks to see if her mother is watching when she
 bows to me. Isn't it strange, Daren, how things turn out? Maybe
 my old friends are right. But I don't <i>feel</i> that I am what
 they think I am.... I would do what I did?over and over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her eyes darkened under his gaze, and a slow crimson tide stained
 her white face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I understand you, Mel," he said, swiftly. "You must forgive me
 that I didn't understand at once.... And I think you are
 infinitely better, finer, purer than these selfsame girls who
 scorn you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren! You?understand?" she faltered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And just as swiftly he told her the revelation that thinking had
 brought to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he had finished she looked at him for a long while. "Yes,
 Daren," she finally said, "you understand, and you have made me
 understand. I always felt"?and her hand went to her
 heart?"but my mind did not grasp.... Oh, Daren, how I thank
 you!" and she held her hands out to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane grasped the outstretched hands, and loosed the leaping
 thought her words and action created.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, let me give your boy a father?a name."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No blow could have made her shrink so palpably. It
 passed?that shame. Her lips parted, and other emotions
 claimed her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren?you would?marry me?" she gasped.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am asking you to be my wife for your child's sake," he
 replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her head bowed. She sank against him, trembling. Her hands clung
 tightly to his. Lane divined something of her agitation from the
 feel of her slender form. And then again that deep and profound
 thrill ran over him. It was followed by an instinct to wrap her
 in his arms, to hold her, to share her trouble and to protect
 her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Strong reserve force suddenly came to Mel. She drew away from
 Lane, still quivering, but composed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, all my life I'll thank you and bless you for that offer,"
 she said, very low. "But, of course it is impossible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She disengaged her hands, and, turning away, looked out of the
 window. Lane rather weakly sat down. What had come over him? His
 blood seemed bursting in his veins. Then he gazed round the dingy
 little parlor and at this girl of twenty, whose beauty did not
 harmonize with her surroundings. Fair-haired, white-faced,
 violet-eyed, she emanated tragedy. He watched her profile, clear
 cut as a cameo, fine brow, straight nose, sensitive lips, strong
 chin. She was biting those tremulous lips. And when she turned
 again to him they were red. The short-bowed upper lip, full and
 sweet, the lower, with its sensitive droop at the corner,
 eloquent of sorrow?all at once Lane realized he wanted to
 kiss that mouth more than he had ever wanted anything. The moment
 was sudden and terrible, for it meant love?love such as he
 had never known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren," she said, turning, "tell me how you got the <i>Croix de
 Guerre</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the look of her and the hand that moved toward his breast,
 Lane felt his power over her. He began his story and it was as if
 he heard some one else talking. When he had finished, she asked,
 "The French Army honored you, why not the American?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was never reported."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How strange! Who was your officer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll laugh when you hear," he replied, without hint of laugh
 himself. "Heavens, how things come about! My officer was from
 Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren! Who?" she asked, quickly, her eyes darkening with
 thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Captain Vane Thesel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How singular to Lane the fact she did not laugh! She only stared.
 Then it seemed part of her warmth and glow, her subtle response
 to his emotion, slowly receded. He felt what he could not see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! He. Vane Thesel," she said, without wonder or surprise or
 displeasure, or any expression Lane anticipated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her strange detachment stirred a hideous thought?could
 Thesel have been.... But Lane killed the culmination of that
 thought. Not, however, before dark, fiery jealousy touched him
 with fangs new to his endurance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To drive it away, Lane launched into more narrative of the war.
 And as he talked he gradually forgot himself. It might be hateful
 to rake up the burning threads of memory for the curious and the
 soulless, but to tell Mel Iden it was a keen, strange delight. He
 watched the changes of her expression. He learned to bring out
 the horror, sadness, glory that abided in her heart. And at last
 he cut himself off abruptly: "But I must save something for
 another day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That broke the spell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, you must never come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He picked up his hat and his stick.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, would you shut the door in my face?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Daren?but I'll not open it," she replied resolutely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must not come."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For my sake?or yours?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Both our sakes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He backed out on the little porch, and looked at her as she stood
 there. Beyond him, indeed, were his emotions then. Sad as she
 seemed, he wanted to make her suffer more?an inexplicable
 and shameful desire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, you and I are alike," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, no, Daren; you are noble and I am...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, in my dreams I see myself standing?plodding along the
 dark shores of a river?that river of tears which runs down
 the vast naked stretch of our inner lives.... I see you now, on
 the opposite shore. Let us reach our hands across?for the
 baby's sake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, it is a beautiful thought, but it?it can't be," she
 whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then let me come to see you when I need?when I'm down," he
 begged.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, what harm can it do?just to let me come?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?don't ask me. Daren, I am no stone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You'll be sorry when I'm out there in?Woodlawn.... That
 won't be long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That broke her courage and her restraint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, then," she whispered, in tears.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER VIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane's intentions and his spirit were too great for his
 endurance. It was some time before he got downtown again. And
 upon entering the inn he was told some one had just called him on
 the telephone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, this is Lane," he answered. "Who called me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's Blair," came the reply. "How are you, old top?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not so well. I've been down and out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry. Suppose that's why you haven't called me up for so long?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Buddy, I can't lay it all to that.... And how're you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The answer did not come. So Lane repeated his query.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm still hobbling round on one leg," replied Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's good. Tell me about Reddie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the reply was long in coming....
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Haven't you heard?about Red?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Haven't seen the newspapers lately?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never read the papers, Blair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right-o. But I had to.... Buck up, now, Dare!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. Shoot it quick," returned Lane, feeling his breast
 contract and his skin tighten with a chill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Red Payson has gone west."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair! You don't mean?dead?" exclaimed Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Reddie's gone?and I guess it's just as well, poor
 devil!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How? When?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Two days ago, according to papers.... He died in Washington,
 D.C. Fell down in the vestibule of one of the government
 offices?where he was waiting.... fell with another
 hemorrhage?and died right there?on the
 floor?quick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My?God!" gasped Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it's tough. You see, Dare, I couldn't keep Reddie here.
 Heaven knows I tried, but he wouldn't stay.... I'm afraid he
 heard my mother complaining. Say, Dare, suppose I have somebody
 drive me in town to see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd like that, Blair."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're on. And say, I've another idea. Tonight's the Junior
 Prom?did you know that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I didn't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, it is. Suppose we go up? My sister can get me cards.... I
 tell you, Dare, I'd like to see what's going on in that bunch.
 I've heard a lot and seen some things."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you hear how I mussed up Fanchon Smith's party?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet I did. That's one reason I want to see some of this
 dancing. Will you go?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I can stand it if you can."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right, Buddy, I'll meet you at the inn?eight o'clock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane slowly made his way to a secluded corner of the lobby, where
 he sat down. Red Payson dead! Lane felt that he should not have
 been surprised or shocked. But he was both. The strange, cold
 sensation gradually wore away and with it the slight trembling of
 his limbs. A mournful procession of thoughts and images returned
 to his mind and he sat and brooded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the hour of his appointment with his friend, Lane went to the
 front of the lobby. Blair was on time. He hobbled in, erect and
 martial of bearing despite the crutch, and his dark citizen's
 suit emphasized the whiteness of his face. Being home had
 softened Blair a little. Yet the pride and tragic bitterness were
 there. But when Blair espied Lane a warmth burned out of the
 havoc in his face. Lane's conscience gave him a twinge. It dawned
 upon him that neither his spells of illness, nor his distress
 over his sister Lorna, nor his obsession to see and understand
 what the young people were doing could hold him wholly excusable
 for having neglected his comrade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Their hand-clasp was close, almost fierce, and neither spoke at
 once. But they looked intently into each other's faces. Emotion
 stormed Lane's heart. He realized that Blair loved him and that
 he loved Blair?and that between them was a measureless
 bond, a something only separation could make tangible. But little
 of what they felt came out in their greetings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, why the devil don't you can that uniform," demanded Blair,
 cheerfully. "People might recognize you've been 'over there.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Blair, I expected you'd have a cork leg by this time,"
 said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nothing doing," returned the other. "I want to be perpetually
 reminded that I was in the war. This 'forget the war' propaganda
 we see and hear all over acts kind of queer on a soldier....
 Let's find a bench away from these people."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After they were comfortably seated Blair went on: "Do you know,
 Dare, I don't miss my leg so much when I'm crutching around. But
 when I try to sit down or get up! By heck, sometimes I forget
 it's gone. And sometimes I want to scratch my lost foot. Isn't
 that hell?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say so, Buddy," returned Lane, with a laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Read this," said Blair, taking a paper from his pocket, and
 indicating a column.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon Lane read a brief Associated Press dispatch from
 Washington, D.C., stating that one Payson, disabled soldier of
 twenty-five, suffering with tuberculosis caused by gassed lungs,
 had come to Washington to make in person a protest and appeal
 that had been unanswered in letters. He wanted money from the
 government to enable him to travel west to a dry climate, where
 doctors assured him he might get well. He made his statement to
 several clerks and officials, and waited all day in the vestibule
 of the department. Suddenly he was seized with a hemorrhage, and,
 falling on the floor, died before aid could be summoned.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Without a word Lane handed the paper back to his friend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Red was a queer duck," said Blair, rather hoarsely. "You
 remember when I 'phoned you last over two weeks ago?... Well,
 just after that Red got bad on my hands. He wouldn't accept
 charity, he said. And he wanted to beat it. He got wise to my
 mother. He wouldn't give up trying to get money from the
 government?back money owed him, he swore?and the idea
 of being turned down at home seemed to obsess him. I talked and
 cussed myself weak. No good! Red beat it soon after
 that?beat it from Middleville on a freight train. And I
 never heard a word from him.... Not a word...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, can't you see it Red's way?" queried Lane, sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I can," responded Blair, "but hell! he might have gotten
 well. Doc Bronson said Red had a chance. I could have borrowed
 enough money to get him out west. Red wouldn't take it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And he ran off?exposed himself to cold and
 starvation?over-exertion and anger," added Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Exactly. Brought on that hemorrhage and croaked. All for
 nothing!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Blair. All for a principle," observed Lane. "Red was fired
 out of the hospital without a dollar. There was something
 terribly wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wrong?... God Almighty!" burst out Blair, with hard passion.
 "Let me read you something in this same paper." With shaking
 hands he unfolded it, searched until he found what he wanted, and
 began to read:
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "'If the <i>actual</i> needs of disabled veterans require the
 expenditure of much money, then unquestionably a majority of the
 taxpayers of the country will favor spending it. Despite the
 insistent demand for economy in Washington that is arising from
 every part of the country, no member of House or Senate will have
 occasion to fear that he is running counter to popular opinion
 when eventually he votes to take generous care of disabled
 soldiers.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair's trembling voice ceased, and then twisting the newspaper
 into a rope, he turned to Lane. "Dare, can you understand
 that?... Red Payson was a bull-headed boy, not over bright. But
 you and I have some intelligence, I hope. We can allow for the
 immense confusion at Washington?the senselessness of red
 tape?the callosity of politicians. But when we remember the
 eloquent calls to us boys?the wonderfully worded appeals to
 our patriotism, love of country and home?the painted
 posters bearing the picture of a beautiful American girl?or
 a young mother with a baby?remembering these deep,
 passionate calls to the best in us, can you understand
 <i>that</i> sort of talk now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, I think I can," replied Lane. "Then?before and
 after the draft?the whole country was at a white heat of
 all that the approach of war rouses. Fear, self-preservation,
 love of country, hate of the Huns, inspired patriotism, and in
 most everybody the will to fight and to sacrifice.... The war was
 a long, hideous, soul-racking, nerve-destroying time. When it
 ended, and the wild period of joy and relief had its run, then
 all that pertained to the war sickened and wearied and disgusted
 the majority of people. It's 'forget the war.' You and Payson and
 I got home a year too late."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then?it's just?monstrous," said Blair, heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's all, Blair. Just monstrous. But we can't beat our spirits
 out against this wall. No one can understand us?how alone
 we are. Let's forget <i>that</i>?this wall?this thing
 called government. Shall we spend what time we have to live
 always in a thunderous atmosphere of mind?hating,
 pondering, bitter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I'll make a compact with you," returned Blair, with flashing
 eyes. "Never to speak again of <i>that</i>?so long as we
 live!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never to a living soul," rejoined Lane, with a ring in his
 voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They shook hands much the same as when they had met half an hour
 earlier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So!" exclaimed Blair, with a deep breath. "And now, Dare, tell
 me how you made out with Helen. You cut me short over the
 'phone."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, that day coming into New York on the ship, you didn't put
 it half strong enough," replied Lane. Then he told Blair about
 the call he had made upon Helen, and what had transpired at her
 studio.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair did not voice the scorn that his eyes expressed. And, in
 fact, most of his talking was confined to asking questions. Lane
 found it easy enough to unburden himself, though he did not
 mention his calls on Mel Iden, or Colonel Pepper's disclosures.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I guess it's high time we were meandering up to the hall,"
 said Blair, consulting his watch. "I'm curious about this Prom.
 Think we're in for a jolt. It's four years since I went to a
 Prom. Now, both of us, Dare, have a sister who'll be there,
 besides all our old friends.... And we're not dancing! But I want
 to look on. They've got an out-of-town orchestra coming?a
 jazz orchestra. There'll probably be a hot time in the old town
 to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna did not tell me," replied Lane, as they got up to go. "But
 I suppose she'd rather I didn't know. We've clashed a good deal
 lately."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, I hear lots of talk," said Blair. "Margaret is chummy with
 me, and some of her friends are always out at the house. I hear
 Dick Swann is rushing Lorna. Think he's doing it on the q-t."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know he is, Blair, but I can't catch them together," returned
 Lane. "Lorna is working now. Swann got her the job."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Looks bad to me," replied Blair, soberly. "Swann is cutting a
 swath. I hear his old man is sore on him.... I'd take Lorna out
 of that office quick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Maybe you would," declared Lane, grimly. "For all the influence
 or power I have over Lorna I might as well not exist."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They walked silently along the street for a little while. Lane
 had to accommodate his step to the slower movement of his
 crippled friend. Blair's crutch tapped over the stone pavement
 and clicked over the curbs. They crossed the railroad tracks and
 turned off the main street to go down a couple of blocks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shades of the past!" exclaimed Blair, as they reached a big
 brick building, well-lighted in front by a sizzling electric
 lamp. The night was rather warm and clouds of insects were
 wheeling round the light. "The moths and the flame!" added Blair,
 satirically. "Well, Dare, old bunkie, brace up and we'll go over
 the top. This ought to be fun for us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't see it," replied Lane. "I'll be about as welcome as a
 bull in a china shop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I didn't mean any one would throw fits over us," responded
 Blair. "But we ought to get some fun out of the fact."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What fact?" queried Lane, puzzled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rather far-fetched, maybe. But I'll get a kick out of looking
 on?watching these swell slackers with the girls <i>we</i>
 fought for."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wonder why they didn't give the dance at the armory, where
 they'd not have to climb stairs, and have more room?" queried
 Lane, as they went in under the big light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, you're far back in the past," said Blair, sardonically.
 "The armory is on the ground floor?one big hall?open,
 you know. The Assembly Hall is a regular maze for rooms and
 stairways."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair labored up the stairway with Lane's help. At last they
 reached the floor from which had blared the strains of jazz. Wide
 doors were open, through which Lane caught the flash of many
 colors. Blair produced his tickets at the door. There did not
 appear to be any one to take them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane experienced an indefinable thrill at the scene. The air
 seemed to reek with a mixed perfume and cigarette smoke?to
 resound with high-keyed youthful laughter, wild and sweet and
 vacant above the strange, discordant music. Then the flashing,
 changing, whirling colors of the dancers struck Lane as oriental,
 erotic, bizarre?gorgeous golds and greens and reds striped
 by the conventional black. Suddenly the blare ceased, and the
 shrill, trilling laughter had dominance. The rapid circling of
 forms came to a sudden stop, and the dancers streamed in all
 directions over the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, they've called time," said Blair. "Let's get inside the
 ropes so we can see better."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hall was not large, but it was long, and shaped like a letter
 L with pillars running down the center. Countless threads of
 many-colored strings of paper had been stretched from pillars to
 walls, hanging down almost within reach of the dancers. Flags and
 gay bunting helped in the riotous effect of decoration. The
 black-faced orchestra held forth on a raised platform at the
 point where the hall looked two ways. Recesses, alcoves and open
 doors to other rooms, which the young couples were piling over
 each other to reach, gave Lane some inkling of what Blair had
 hinted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now we're out in the limelight," announced Blair, as he halted.
 "Let's stand here and run the gauntlet until the next
 dance?then we can find seats."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Almost at once a stream of gay couples enveloped them in passing.
 Bright, flashing, vivid faces and bare shoulders, arms and
 breasts appeared above the short bodices of the girls. Few of
 them were gowned in white. The colors seemed too garish for
 anything but musical comedy. But the freshness, the vividness of
 these girls seemed exhilarating. The murmur, the merriment
 touched a forgotten chord in Lane's heart. For a moment it seemed
 sweet to be there, once more in a gathering where pleasure was
 the pursuit. It breathed of what seemed long ago, in a past that
 was infinitely more precious to remember because he had no future
 of hope or of ambition or dream. Something had happened to him
 that now made the sensations of the moment stingingly
 bitter-sweet. The freshness and fragrance, the color and
 excitement, the beauty and gayety were not for him. Youth was
 dead. He could never enter the lists with these young men, many
 no younger than he, for the favor and smile of a girl.
 Resignation had not been so difficult in the spiritual moment of
 realization and resolve, but to be presented with one concrete
 and stunning actuality after another, each with its mocking
 might-have-been, had grown to be a terrible ordeal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane looked for faces he knew. On each side of the pillar where
 he and Blair stood the stream of color and gayety flowed. Helen
 and Margaret Maynard went by on the far edge of that stream.
 Across the hall he caught a glimpse of the flashing golden beauty
 of Bessy Bell. Then near at hand he recognized Fanchon Smith, a
 petite, smug-faced little brunette, with naked shoulders bulging
 out of a piebald gown. She espied Lane and her face froze. Then
 there were familiar faces near and far, to which Lane could not
 attach names.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All at once he became aware that other of his senses besides
 sight were being stimulated. He had been hearing without
 distinguishing what he heard. And curiously he listened, still
 with that strange knock of memory at his heart. Everybody was
 talking, some low, some high, all in the spirit of the hour. And
 in one moment he had heard that which killed the false
 enchantment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not a chance! ..."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog?she's some Jane!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now to the clinch?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'll we do till the next spiel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have a shot???"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boys, it's only the shank of the evening. Leave something peppy
 for the finish."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mame, you look like a million dollars in that rag."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She shakes a mean shimmy, believe me...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That egg! Not on your life!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cut the next with Ned. We'll sneak down and take a ride in my
 car...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, spiffy!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane's acutely strained attention was diverted by Blair's voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look who's with my sister Margie."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned to look through an open space in the dispersing
 stream. Blair's sister was passing with Dick Swann. Elegantly and
 fastidiously attired, the young millionaire appeared to be
 attentive to his partner. Margaret stood out rather strikingly
 from the other girls near her by reason of the simplicity and
 modesty of her dress. She did not look so much bored as
 discontented. Lane saw her eyes rove to and fro from the entrance
 of the hall. When she espied Lane she nodded and spoke with a
 smile and made an evident move toward him, but was restrained by
 Swann. He led her past Lane and Blair without so much as glancing
 in their direction. Lane heard Blair swear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, if my mother throws Marg at that?slacker, I'll block
 the deal if it's the last thing I ever do," he declared,
 violently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I'll help you," replied Lane, instantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know Margie hates him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, your sister is in love with Holt Dalrymple."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No! Not really? Thought that was only a boy-and-girl affair....
 Aha! the nigger music again! Let's find a seat, Dare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Saxophone, trombone, piccolo, snare-drum and other barbaric
 instruments opened with a brazen defiance of music, and a vibrant
 assurance of quick, raw, strong sounds. Lane himself felt the
 stirring effect upon his nerves. He had difficulty in keeping
 still. From the lines of chairs along the walls and from doors
 and alcoves rushed the gay-colored throng to leap, to close, to
 step, to rock and sway, until the floor was full of a moving mass
 of life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first half-dozen couples Lane studied all danced more or less
 as Helen and Swann had, that day in Helen's studio. Then, by way
 of a remarkable contrast, there passed two young people who
 danced decently. Lane descried his sister Lorna in the throng,
 and when she and her partner came round in the giddy circle, Lane
 saw that she wiggled and toddled like the others. Lane, as she
 passed him, caught a glance of her eyes, flashing, reproachful,
 furious, directed at some one across her partner's shoulder. Lane
 followed that glance and saw Swann. Apparently he did not notice
 Lorna, and was absorbed in the dance with his own partner, Helen
 Wrapp. This byplay further excited Lane's curiosity. On the
 whole, it was an ungraceful, violent mob, almost totally lacking
 in restraint, whirling, kicking, swaying, clasping, instinctively
 physical, crude, vulgar and wild. Down the line of chairs from
 his position, Lane saw the chaperones of the Prom, no doubt
 mothers of some of these girls. Lane wondered at them with
 sincere and persistent amaze. If they were respectable, and had
 even a slight degree of intelligence, how could they look on at
 this dance with complacence? Perhaps after all the young people
 were not wholly to blame for an abnormal expression of
 instinctive action.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That dance had its several encores and finally ended.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret and Holt made their way up to Lane and Blair. The girl
 was now radiant. It took no second glance for Lane to see how
 matters stood with her at that moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, beat it, you two," suddenly spoke up Blair. "There comes
 Swann. He's looking for you. Chase yourselves, now,
 Marg?Holt. Leave that slacker to <i>us</i>!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret gave a start, a gasp. She looked hard at her brother.
 Blair wore a cool smile, underneath which there was sterner
 hidden meaning. Then Margaret looked at Lane with slow, deep
 blush, making her really beautiful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margie, we're for you two, strong," said Lane, with a smile. "Go
 hide from Swann."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I?I came with him," she faltered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then let him find you?in other words, let him <i>get</i>
 you.... 'All's fair in love and war.'"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had his reward in the sweet amaze and confusion of her face,
 as she turned away. Holt rushed her off amid the straggling
 couples.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, you're a wiz," declared Blair. "Margie's strong for
 Holt?I'm glad. If we could only put Swann out of the
 running."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a cinch," returned Lane, with sudden heat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pard, you don't know my mother. If she has picked out Swann for
 Margie?all I've got to say is?good night!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Even if we prove Swann??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No matter what we prove," interrupted Blair. "No matter what, so
 long as he's out of jail. My mother is money mad. She'd sell
 Margie to the devil himself for gold, position?the means to
 queen it over these other mothers of girls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, you're?you're a little off your nut, aren't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not on your life. That talk four years ago might have been
 irrational. But now?not on your life.... The world has come
 to an end.... Oh, Lord, look who's coming! Lane, did you ever in
 your life see such a peach as that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy Bell had appeared, coming toward them with a callow youth
 near her own age. Her dress was some soft, pale blue material
 that was neither gaudy nor fantastical. But it was far from
 modest. Lane had to echo Blair's eulogy of this young specimen of
 the new America. She simply verified and stabilized the assertion
 that physically the newer generations of girls were markedly more
 beautiful than those of any generation before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy either forgot to introduce her escort or did not care to.
 She nodded a dismissal to him, spoke sweetly to Blair, and then
 took the empty chair next to Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're having a rotten time," she said, leaning close to him.
 She seemed all fragrance and airy grace and impelling life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had to smile. "How do you know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can tell by your face. Now aren't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, to be honest, Miss Bessy"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For tripe's sake, don't be so formal," she interrupted. "Call me
 Bessy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, very well, Bessy. There's no use to lie to you. I'm not very
 happy at what I see here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the matter with it?with us?" she queried, quickly.
 "Everybody's doing it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That is no excuse. Besides, that's not so. Everybody is
 not?not??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, not what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not doing it, whatever you meant by that," returned Lane, with a
 laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me straight out what <i>you</i> think of us," she shot at
 Lane, with a purple flash of her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She irritated Lane. Stirred him somehow, yet she seemed
 wholesome, full of quick response. She was daring, sophisticated,
 provocative. Therefore Lane retorted in brief, blunt speech what
 he thought of the majority of the girls present.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy Bell did not look insulted. She did not blush. She did not
 show shame. Her eyes darkened. Her rosy mouth lost something of
 its soft curves.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane, we're not all rotten," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did not say or imply you <i>all</i> were," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She gazed up at him thoughtfully, earnestly, with an unconscious
 frank interest, curiosity, and reverence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You strike me funny," she mused. "I never met a soldier like
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, how many soldiers have you met who have come back from
 France?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not many, only Blair and you, and Captain Thesel, though I
 really didn't meet him. He came up to me at the armory and spoke
 to me. And to-night he cut in on Roy's dance. Roy was sore."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three. Well, that's not many," replied Lane. "Not enough to get
 a line on two million, is it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Captain Thesel is just like all the other fellows.... But you're
 not a bit like them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that a compliment or otherwise?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say it's a compliment," she replied, with arch eyes on his.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you don't deserve it.... You promised to make a date with
 me. Why haven't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why child, I?I don't know what to say," returned Lane,
 utterly disconcerted. Yet he liked this amazing girl. "I suppose
 I forgot. But I've been ill, for one reason."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry," she said, giving his arm a squeeze. "I heard you
 were badly hurt. Won't you tell me about your?your hurts?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some day, if opportunity affords. I can't here, that's certain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Opportunity! What do you want? Haven't I handed myself out on a
 silver platter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could find no ready retort for this query. He gazed at her,
 marveling at the apparently measureless distance between her
 exquisite physical beauty and the spiritual beauty that should
 have been harmonious with it. Still he felt baffled by this young
 girl. She seemed to resemble Lorna, yet was different in a way he
 could not grasp. Lorna had coarsened in fibre. This girl was
 fine, despite her coarse speech. She did not repel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Lane, will you dance with me?" she asked, almost wistfully.
 She liked him, and was not ashamed of it. But she seemed
 pondering over what to make of him?how far to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, I dare not exert myself to that extent," he replied,
 gently. "You forget I am a disabled soldier."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Forget that? Not a chance," she flashed. "But I hoped you might
 dance with me once?just a little."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I might keel over."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She shivered and her eyes dilated. "You mean it as a joke. But
 it's no joke.... I read about your comrade?that poor Red
 Payson!" ... Then both devil of humor and woman of fire shone in
 her glance. "Daren, if you <i>did</i> keel over?you'd die
 in my arms?not on the floor!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then another partner came up to claim her. As the orchestra
 blurted forth and Bessy leaned to the dancer's clasp she shouted
 audaciously at Lane: "Don't forget that silver platter!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned to Blair to find that worthy shaking his handsome
 head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you hear what she said?" asked Lane, close to Blair's ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Every word," replied Blair. "Some kid!... She's like the girl in
 the motion-pictures. She comes along. She meets the fellow. She
 looks at him?she says 'good day'?then <i>Wham</i>,
 into his arms.... My God! ... Lane, is that kid good or bad?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good!" exclaimed Lane, instantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bah!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good?still," returned Lane. "But alas! She is brazen,
 unconscious of it. But she's no fool, that kid. Lorna is an
 absolute silly bull-headed fool. I wish Bessy Bell was my
 sister?or I mean that Lorna was like her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here comes Swann without Margie. Looks sore as a pup.
 The??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shut up, Blair. I want to listen to this jazz."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane shut his eyes during the next number and listened without
 the disconcerting spectacle in his sight. He put all the
 intensity of which he was capable into his attention. His
 knowledge of music was not extensive, but on the other hand it
 was enough to enable him to analyze this jazz. Neither music nor
 ragtime, it seemed utterly barbarian in character. It appealed
 only to primitive, physical, sensual instincts. It could not be
 danced to sanely and gracefully. When he opened his eyes again,
 to see once more the disorder of dancers in spirit and action, he
 seemed to have his analysis absolutely verified.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 These dances were short, the encores very brief, and the
 intermissions long. Perhaps the dancers needed to get their
 breath and rearrange their apparel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After this number, Lane left Blair talking to friends, and made
 his way across the hall to where he espied Lorna. She did not see
 him. She looked ashamed, hurt, almost sullen. Her young friend,
 Harry, was bending over talking earnestly. Lane caught the words:
 "Lorna dear, that Swann's only stringing you?rushing you on
 the sly. He won't dance with you <i>here</i>?not while he's
 with that swell crowd."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a lie," burst out Lorna. She was almost in tears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane took her arm, making her start.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, kids, you're having some time, aren't you," he said,
 cheerfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure?are," gulped Harry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna repressed her grief, but not her sullen resentment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane pretended not to notice anything unusual, and after a few
 casual remarks and queries he left them. Strolling from place to
 place, mingling with the gay groups, in the more secluded alcoves
 and recesses where couples appeared, oblivious to eyes, in the
 check room where a sign read: "check your corsets," out in the
 wide landing where the stairway came up, Lane passed, missing
 little that might have been seen or heard. He did not mind that
 two of the chaperones stared at him in supercilious curiosity, as
 if speculating on a possible <i>faux pas</i> of his at this
 dance. Both boys and girls he had met since his return to
 Middleville, and some he had known before, encountered him face
 to face, and cut him dead. He heard sarcastic remarks. He was an
 outsider, a "dead one," a "has been" and a "lemon." But Margaret
 was gracious to him, and Flossie Dickerson made no bones of her
 regard. Dorothy, he was relieved and glad to see, was not
 present.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had no particular object in mind. He just wanted to rub
 elbows with this throng of young people. This was the joy of life
 he had imagined he had missed while in France. How much vain
 longing! He had missed nothing. He had boundlessly gained.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Out on this floor a railing ran round the curve of the stairway.
 Girls were sitting on it, smoking cigarettes, and kicking their
 slipper-shod feet. Their partners were lounging close. Lane
 passed by, and walking to a window in the shadow he stood there.
 Presently one of the boys threw away his cigarette and said:
 "Come on, Ironsides. I gotta dance. You're a rotten dancer, but I
 love you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They ran back into the hall. The young fellow who was left
 indolently attempted to kiss his partner, who blew smoke in his
 face. Then at a louder blast of jazz they bounced away. The next
 moment a third couple appeared, probably from another door down
 the hall. They did not observe Lane. The girl was slim, dainty,
 gorgeously arrayed, and her keen, fair face bore traces of paint
 wet by perspiration. Her companion was Captain Vane Thesel, in
 citizen's garb, well-built, ruddy-faced, with tiny curled
 moustache.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurry, kid," he said, breathlessly, as he pulled at her. "We'll
 run down and take a spin."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Spiffy! But let's wait till after the next," she replied. "It's
 Harold's and I came with him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell him it was up to him to find you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But he might get wise to a car ride."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He'd do the same. Come on," returned Thesel, who all the time
 was leading her down the stairway step by step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They disappeared. From the open window Lane saw them go down the
 street and get into a car and ride away. He glanced at his watch,
 muttering. "This is a new stunt for dances. I just wonder." He
 watched, broodingly and sombrely. It was not his sister, but it
 might just as well have been. Two dances and a long intermission
 ended before Lane saw the big auto return. He watched the couple
 get out, and hurry up, to disappear at the entrance. Then Lane
 changed his position, and stood directly at the head of the
 stairway under the light. He had no interest in Captain Vane
 Thesel. He just wanted to get a close look at the girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently he heard steps, heavy and light, and a man's deep
 voice, a girl's low thrill of laughter. They turned the curve in
 the stairway and did not see Lane until they had mounted to the
 top.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With cool steady gaze Lane studied the girl. Her clear eyes met
 his. If there was anything unmistakable in Lane's look at her, it
 was not from any deception on his part. He tried to look into her
 soul. Her smile?a strange indolent little smile, remnant of
 excitement?faded from her face. She stared, and she put an
 instinctive hand up to her somewhat dishevelled hair. Then she
 passed on with her companion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of all the nerve!" she exclaimed. "Who's that soldier boob?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could not catch the low reply. He lingered there a while
 longer, and then returned to the hall, much surprised to find it
 so dark he could scarcely distinguish the dancers. The lights had
 been lowered. If the dance had been violent and strange before
 this procedure, it was now a riot. In the semi-darkness the
 dancers cut loose. The paper strings had been loosened and had
 fallen down to become tangled with the flying feet and legs.
 Confetti swarmed like dark snowdrops in the hot air. Lane
 actually smelled the heat of bodies?a strangely stirring
 and yet noxious sensation. A rushing, murmuring, shrill
 sound?voices, laughter, cries, and the sliding of feet and
 brushing of gowns?filled the hall?ominous to Lane's
 over-sensitive faculties, swelling unnaturally, the expression of
 unrestrained physical abandon. Lane walked along the edge of this
 circling, wrestling melee, down to the corner where the orchestra
 held forth. They seemed actuated by the same frenzy which
 possessed the dancers. The piccolo player lay on his back on top
 of the piano, piping his shrill notes at the ceiling. And Lane
 made sure this player was drunk. On the moment then the jazz came
 to an end with a crash. The lights flashed up. The dancers
 clapped and stamped their pleasure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane wound his way back to Blair.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've had enough, Blair," he said. "I'm all in. Let's go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Right-o," replied Blair, with evident relief. He reached a hand
 to Lane to raise himself, an action he rarely resorted to, and
 awkwardly got his crutch in place. They started out, with Lane
 accommodating his pace to his crippled comrade. Thus it happened
 that the two ran a gauntlet with watching young people on each
 side, out to the open part of the hall. There directly in front
 they encountered Captain Vane Thesel, with Helen Wrapp on his
 arm. Her red hair, her green eyes, and carmined lips, the white
 of her voluptuous neck and arms, united in a singular effect of
 allurement that Lane felt with scorn and melancholy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen nodded to Blair and Lane, and evidently dragged at her
 escort's arm to hold him from passing on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look who's here! Daren, old boy?and Blair," she called,
 and she held the officer back. The malice in her green glance did
 not escape Lane, as he bowed to her. She gloried in that
 situation. Captain Thesel had to face them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Blair's hand that stiffened Lane. They halted, erect, like
 statues, with eyes that failed to see Thesel. He did not exist
 for them. With a flush of annoyance he spoke, and breaking from
 Helen, passed on. A sudden silence in the groups nearby gave
 evidence that the incident had been observed. Then whispers rose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boys, aren't you dancing?" asked Helen, with a mocking
 sweetness. "Let me teach you the new steps."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thanks, Helen," replied Lane, in sudden weariness. "But I
 couldn't go it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did you come? To blow us up again? Lose your nerve?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I lost it to-night?and something more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, you shouldn't have left one of your legs in France," she
 said, turning to Blair. She had always hated Blair, a fact
 omnipresent now in her green eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair had left courtesy and endurance in France, as was evinced
 by the way he bent closer to Helen, to speak low, with terrible
 passion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I had it to do over again?I'd see <i>you</i> and
 <i>your</i> kind?your dirt-cheap crowd of painted hussies
 where you belong?in the clutch of the Huns!"
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER IX
 </h2>
 <p>
 Miss Amanda Hill, teacher in the Middleville High School, sat
 wearily at her desk. She was tired, as tired as she had ever been
 on any day of the fifteen long years in which she had wrestled
 with the problems of school life. Her hair was iron gray and she
 bent a worn, sad, severe face over a mass of notes before her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that moment she was laboring under a perplexing question that
 was not by any means a new one. Only this time it had presented
 itself in a less insidious manner than usual, leaving no loophole
 for charitable imagination. Presently she looked up and rapped on
 her desk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These young ladies will remain after school is dismissed," she
 said, in her authoritative voice: "Bessy Bell?Rose
 Clymer?Gail Matthews?Helen Tremaine?Ruth
 Winthrop.... Also any other girls who are honest enough to admit
 knowledge of the notes found in Rose Clymer's desk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The hush that fell over the schoolroom was broken by the gong in
 the main hall, sounding throughout the building. Then followed
 the noise of shutting books and closing desks, and the bustle and
 shuffling of anticipated dismissal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In a front seat sat a girl who did not arise with the others, and
 as one by one several girls passed her desk with hurried step and
 embarrassed snicker she looked at them with purple, blazing eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Hill attended to her usual task with the papers of the day's
 lessons and the marking of the morrow's work before she glanced
 up at the five girls she had detained. They sat in widely
 separated sections of the room. Rose Clymer, pretty, fragile,
 curly-haired, occupied the front seat of the end row. Her face
 had no color and her small mouth was set in painful lines. Four
 seats across from her Bessy Bell leaned on her desk, with defiant
 calmness, and traces of scorn still in her expressive eyes. Gail
 Matthews looked frightened and Helen Tremaine was crying. Ruth
 Winthrop bent forward with her face buried in her arms.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Girls," began Miss Hill, presently. "I know you regard me as a
 cross old schoolteacher."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had spoken impulsively, a rare thing with her, and occasioned
 in this instance by the painful consciousness of how she was
 judged, when she was really so kindly disposed toward the wayward
 girls.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Girls, I've tried to get into close touch with you, to
 sympathize, to be lenient; but somehow, I've failed," she went
 on. "Certainly I have failed to stop this note-writing. And
 lately it has become?beyond me to understand. Now won't you
 help me to get at the bottom of the matter? Helen, it was you who
 told me these notes were in Rose's desk. Have you any knowledge
 of more?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ye?s?m," said Helen, raising her red face.
 "I've?I've one?I?was afraid to g?give
 up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bring it to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Helen rose and came forward with an expressive little fist and
 opening it laid a crumpled paper upon Miss Hill's desk. As Helen
 returned to her seat she met Bessy Bell's fiery glance and it
 seemed to wither her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The teacher smoothed out the paper and began to read. "Good
 Heavens!" she breathed, in amaze and pain. Then she turned to
 Helen. "This verse is in your handwriting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes'm?but I?I only copied it," responded the
 culprit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who gave you the original?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where did she get it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I don't know?Miss Hill. Really and tru?truly
 I don't," faltered Helen, beginning to cry again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Gail and Ruth also disclaimed any knowledge of the verse, except
 that it had been put into their hands by Rose. They had read it,
 copied it, written notes about it and discussed it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You three girls may go home now," said Miss Hill, sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girls hastily filed out and passed the scornful Bessy Bell
 with averted heads.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, can you explain the notes found in your possession?" asked
 the teacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Hill. They were written to me by different boys and
 girls," replied Rose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do you seem to have all these writings addressed to you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't get any more than any other girl. But I wasn't afraid
 to keep mine."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know where these verses came from, before Helen had
 them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Miss Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you know who wrote them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't tell," replied Rose, deliberately. She looked straight
 into her teacher's eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You refuse when I've assured you I'll be lenient?" demanded Miss
 Hill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm no tattletale." Rose's answer was sullen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, I ask you again. A great deal depends on your answer. Will
 you tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl's lip curled. Then she laughed in a way that made Miss
 Hill think of her as older. But she kept silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, you're expelled until further notice." Miss Hill's voice
 trembled with disappointment and anger. "You may go now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose gathered up her books and went into the cloakroom. The door
 in the outer hall opened and closed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Hill, it wasn't fair!" exclaimed Bessy Bell, hotly. "It
 wasn't fair. Rose is no worse than the other girls. She's not as
 bad, for she isn't sly and deceitful. There were a dozen girls
 who lied when they went out. Helen lied. Ruth lied. Gail lied.
 But Rose told the truth so far as she went. And she wouldn't tell
 all because she wanted to shield me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why did she want to shield you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I wrote the verses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean you copied them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I composed them," Bessy replied coolly. Her blue eyes fearlessly
 met Miss Hill's gaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy Bell!" ejaculated the teacher.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The girl stood before her desk and from the tip of her dainty
 boot to the crown of her golden hair breathed forth a strange,
 wilful and rebellious fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Hill's lips framed to ask a certain question of Bessy, but
 she refrained and substituted another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, how old are you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fifteen last April."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you any intelligent idea of?do you know?Bessy,
 <i>how</i> did you write those verses?" asked Miss Hill, in
 bewilderment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know a good deal and I've imagination," replied Bessy,
 candidly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's evident," returned the teacher. "How long has this
 note-and verse-writing been going on?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "For a year, at least, among us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then you caught the habit from girls gone higher up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Certainly."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy's trenchant brevity was not lost upon Miss Hill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We've always gotten along?you and I," said Miss Hill,
 feeling her way with this strange girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's because you're kind and square, and I like you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something told the teacher she had never been paid a higher
 compliment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, how much will you tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Hill, I'm in for it and I'll tell you everything, if only
 you won't punish Rose," replied the girl, impulsively. "Rose's my
 best friend. Her father's a mean, drunken brute. I'm afraid of
 what he'll do if he finds out. Rose has a hard time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You say Rose is no more guilty than the other girls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose Clymer never had an idea of her own. She's just sweet and
 willing. I hate deceitful girls. Every one of them wrote notes to
 the boys?the same kind of notes?and some of them
 tried to write poetry. Most of them had a copy of the piece I
 wrote. They had great fun over it?getting the boys to guess
 what girl wrote it. I've written a dozen pieces before this and
 they've all had them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that explains the verses.... Now I read in these notes
 about meetings with the boys?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That refers to mornings before school, and after school, and
 evenings when it's nice weather. And the literary society."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean the Girl's Literary Guild, with rooms at the Atheneum?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. But, Miss Hill, the literary part of it is bunk. We meet
 there to dance. The boys bring the girls cigarettes. They smoke,
 and sometimes the boys have something with them to drink."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "These?these girls?hardly in their teens?smoke
 and drink?" gasped Miss Hill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say they do," replied Bessy Bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?does the 'Bell-garter' mean?" went on the teacher,
 presently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "One of the boys stole my garter and fastened a little bell to
 it. Now it's going the rounds. Every girl who could has worn it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the 'Old Bench'?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Down in the basement here at school there's a bench under the
 stairway in the dark. The boys and girls have signals. One boy
 will get permission to go out at a certain time, and a girl from
 his room, or another room, will go out too. It's all arranged
 beforehand. They meet down on the Old Bench."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They meet to spoon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I find the names Hardy Mackay, Captain Thesel, Dick Swann among
 these notes. What can these young society men be to my pupils?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some of the jealous girls have been tattling to each other and
 mentioning names."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy! Do you imply these girls who talk have had the?the
 interest or attention of these young gentlemen named?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In what way?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I mean they've had dates to meet in the park?and other
 places. Then they go joy riding."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, have you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but only just lately."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you Bessy, for your?your frankness," replied Miss
 Hill, drawing a long breath. "I'll have another talk with you,
 after I see your mother. You may go now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was an indication of Miss Hill's mental perturbation that for
 once she broke her methodical routine. For many years she had
 carried a lunch-basket to and from school; for so many in fact
 that now on Saturdays when she went to town without it she
 carried her left hand forward in the same position that had grown
 habitual to her while holding it. But this afternoon, as she went
 out, she forgot the basket entirely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll go to Mrs. Bell," soliloquized the worried schoolteacher.
 "But how to explain what I can't understand! Some people would
 call this thing just natural depravity. But I love these girls.
 As I think back, every year, in the early summer, I've always had
 something of this sort of thing to puzzle over. But the last few
 years it's grown worse. The war made a difference. And since the
 war?how strange the girls are! They seem to feel more.
 They're bolder. They break out oftener. They dress so immodestly.
 Yet they're less deceitful. They have no shame. I can blind
 myself no longer to that. And this last is damning proof
 of?of wildness. Some of them have taken the fatal step! ...
 Yet?yet I seem to feel somehow Bessy Bell isn't <i>bad</i>.
 I wonder if my hope isn't responsible for that feeling. I'm
 old-fashioned. This modern girl is beyond me. How clearly she
 spoke! She's a wonderful, fearless, terrible girl. I never saw a
 girl so alive. I can't?can't understand her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the swift swinging from one consideration of the perplexing
 question to another Miss Hill's mind naturally reverted to her
 errand, and to her possible reception. Mrs. Bell was a proud
 woman. She had married against the wishes of her blue-blooded
 family, so rumor had it, and her husband was now Chief of Police
 in Middleville. Mrs. Bell had some money of her own and was
 slowly recovering her old position in society.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not without misgivings that Miss Hill presented herself at
 Mrs. Bell's door and gave her card to a servant. The teacher had
 often made thankless and misunderstood calls upon the mothers of
 her pupils. She was admitted and shown to a living room where a
 woman of fair features and noble proportions greeted her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy's teacher, I presume?" she queried, graciously, yet with
 just that slight touch of hauteur which made Miss Hill feel her
 position.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am Bessy's teacher," she replied, with dignity. "Can you spare
 me a few minutes?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Assuredly. Please be seated. I've heard Bessy speak of you. By
 the way, the child hasn't come home yet. How late she always is!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Hill realized, with a protest at the unfairness of the
 situation, that to face this elegant lady, so smiling, so suave,
 so worldly, so graciously superior, and to tell her some
 unpleasant truths about her daughter, was a task by no means
 easy, and one almost sure to prove futile. But Miss Hill never
 shirked her duty, and after all, her motive was a hope to help
 Bessy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Bell, I've come on a matter of importance," began Miss
 Hill. "But it is so delicate a one I don't know how to broach it.
 I believe plain speaking best."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here Miss Hill went into detail, sparing not to call a spade a
 spade. But she held back the names of the young society gentlemen
 mentioned in the notes. Miss Hill was not sure of her ground
 there and her revelation was grave enough for any intelligent
 mother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Really, Miss Hill, you amaze me!" exclaimed Mrs. Bell. "Bessie
 has fallen into bad company. Oh, these public schools! I never
 attended one, but I've heard what they are."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The public schools are not to blame," replied Miss Hill,
 bluntly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mrs. Bell gave her visitor a rather supercilious stare.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "May I ask you to explain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm afraid I can't explain," replied Miss Hill, conscious of a
 little heat. "I've proofs of the condition. But as I can't
 understand it, how can I explain? I have my own peculiar ideas,
 only, lately, I've begun to doubt them. A year or so ago I would
 have said girls had their own way too much?too much time to
 themselves?too much freedom. But now I seem to feel life
 isn't like what it was a few years ago. Girls are bound to learn.
 And they never learn at home, that's sure. The last thing a
 mother will do is to tell her daughter what she <i>ought</i> to
 know. There's always been a shadow between most mothers and
 daughters. And in these days of jazz it has become a wall.
 Perhaps that's why girls don't confide in their mothers.... Mrs.
 Bell, I considered it my duty to acquaint you with the truth
 about these verses and notes, and what they imply. Would you care
 to read some of them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, but they wouldn't interest me in the least," replied
 Mrs. Bell, coldly. "I wouldn't insult Bessy or her girl friends.
 I imagine it's all some risque suggestion overheard and made much
 of or a few verses mischievously plagiarized. I'm no prude, Miss
 Hill. I know enough not to be strict, which is apparently the
 fault of the school system. As for my own daughter I understand
 her perfectly and trust her implicitly. I know the blood in her.
 And I shall remove her from public school and place her in a
 private institution under a tutor, where she'll no longer be
 exposed to contaminating influences.... I thank you for your
 intention, which I'm sure is kind?and, will you please
 excuse me? I must dress for my bridge party. Good afternoon, Miss
 Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The schoolteacher plodded homeward, her eyes downcast and sad.
 The snub given her by the mother had not hurt her as had the
 failure to help the daughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I knew it?I knew it. I'll never try again. That woman's
 mind is a wilderness where her girl is concerned. How brainless
 these mothers are!... Yet if I'd ever had a girl?I
 wonder?would I have been blind? One's own blood?that
 must be the reason. Pride. Could I have believed of <i>my</i>
 girl what I admitted of hers? Perhaps not till too late. That
 would be so human. But, oh! the mystery?the sadness of
 it?the fatality!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose Clymer left the High School with the settled, indifferent
 bitterness of one used to trouble. Every desire she followed,
 turn what way she would, every impulse reaching to grasp some
 girlish gleam of happiness, resulted in the inevitable rebuke.
 And this time it had been disgrace. But Rose felt she did not
 care if she could only deceive her father. No cheerful task was
 it to face him. Shivering at the thought she resolved to elude
 the punishment he was sure to inflict if he learned why she had
 been expelled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had no twinge of conscience. She was used to slights and
 unkindness, and did not now reflect upon the justice of her
 dismissal. What little pleasure she got came from friendships
 with boys, and these her father had forbidden her to have. In the
 bitter web of her thought ran the threads that if she had pretty
 clothes like Helen, and a rich mother like Bessy, and a father
 who was not a drunkard, her lot in life would have been happy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose lived with her stepfather in three dingy rooms in the mill
 section of Middleville. She never left the wide avenues and lawns
 and stately residences, which she had to pass on her way to and
 from school, without contrasting them with the dirty alleys and
 grimy walls and squalid quarters of the working-class. She had
 grown up in that class, but in her mind there was always a faint
 vague recollection of a time when her surroundings had been
 bright and cheerful, where there had been a mother who had taught
 her to love beautiful things. To-day she climbed the rickety
 stairs to her home and pushed open the latchless door with a
 revolt brooding in her mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A man in his shirt sleeves sat by the little window.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why father?home so early?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes lass, home early," he replied wearily. "I'm losing my place
 again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had straggling gray hair, bleared eyes with an opaque, glazy
 look and a bluish cast of countenance. His chin was buried in the
 collar of his open shirt; his shoulders sagged, and he breathed
 heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One glance assured Rose her father was not very much under the
 influence of drink. And fear left her. When even half-sober he
 was kind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you've lost your place?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Old Swann is layin' off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was an untruth, Rose knew, because the mills had never been
 so full, and men never so in demand. Besides her father was an
 expert at his trade and could always have work.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm sorry," she said, slowly. "I've been thinking lately that
 I'll give up school and go to work. In an office uptown or a
 department store."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, that'd be good of you," he replied. "You could help along
 a lot. I don't do my work so well no more. But your poor mother
 won't rest in her grave. She was so proud of you, always
 dreamin'."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The lamp Rose lighted showed comfortless rooms, with but few
 articles of furniture. It was with the deft fingers of long
 practice that the girl spread the faded table-cloth, laid the
 dishes, ground the coffee, peeled the potatoes, and cut the
 bread. Then presently she called her father to the meal. He ate
 in silence, having relapsed once more into the dull gloom natural
 to him. When he had finished he took up his hat and with slow
 steps left the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No more study for me," mused Rose, and she felt both glad and
 sorry. "What will Bessy say? She won't like it. I wonder what old
 Hill did to her. Let her off easy. I won't get to see Bessy so
 much now. No more afternoons in the park. But I'll have the
 evenings. Best of all, some nice clothes to wear. I might some
 day have a lovely gown like that Miss Maynard wore the night of
 the Prom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose washed and dried the dishes, put them away, and cleaned up
 the little kitchen in a way that spoke well for her. And she did
 it cheerfully, for in the interest of this new idea of work she
 forgot her trouble and discontent. Taking up the lamp she went to
 her room. It contained a narrow bed, a bureau, a small wardrobe
 and a rug. The walls held several pictures, and some touches of
 color in the way of ribbons, bright posters, and an
 orange-and-blue banner. A photograph of Bessy Bell stood on the
 bureau and the girl's beauty seemed like a light in the dingy
 room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose looked in the mirror and smiled and tossed her curly head.
 She studied the oval face framed in its mass of curls, the steady
 gray-blue eyes, the soft, wistful, tenderly curved lips. "Yes,
 I'm pretty," she said. "And I'm going to buy nice things to
 wear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly she heard a pattering on the roof.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rain! What do you know about that? I've got to stay in. If I
 spoil that relic of a hat I'll never have the nerve to go ask for
 a job."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She prepared for bed, and placing the lamp on the edge of the
 bureau, she lay down to become absorbed in a paper-backed novel.
 The mill-clock was striking ten when she finished. There was a
 dreamy light in her eyes and a glow upon her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How grand to be as beautiful as she was and turn out to be an
 heiress with blue blood, and a lovely mother, and handsome lovers
 dying for her!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then she flung the novel against the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's only a book. It's not true."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose blew out the lamp and went to sleep.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the night she dreamed that the principal of the High
 School had called to see her father, and she awoke trembling.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room was dark as pitch; the rain pattered on the roof; the
 wind moaned softly under the eaves. A rat somewhere in the wall
 made a creaking noise. Rose hated to awaken in the middle of the
 night. She listened for her father's breathing, and failing to
 hear it, knew he had not yet come home. Often she was left alone
 until dawn. She tried bravely to go to sleep again but found it
 impossible; she lay there listening, sensitive to every little
 sound. The silence was almost more dreadful than the stealthy
 unknown noises of the night. Vague shapes seemed to hover over
 her bed. Somehow to-night she dreaded them more. She was sixteen
 years old, yet there abided with her the terror of the child in
 the dark.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She cried out in her heart?why was she alone? It was so
 dark, so silent. Mother! Mother!... She would never?never
 say her prayers again!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The brazen-tongued mill clock clanged the hour of two, when
 shuffling uncertain footsteps sounded on the hollow stairs. Rose
 raised her head to listen. With slow, weary, dragging steps her
 father came in. Then she lay back on the pillow with a sigh of
 relief.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER X
 </h2>
 <p>
 In the following week Rose learned that work was not to be had
 for the asking. Her love of pretty things and a desire to be
 independent of her father had occupied her mind to the exclusion
 of a consideration of what might be demanded of a girl seeking a
 position. She had no knowledge of stenography or bookkeeping; her
 handwriting was poor. Moreover, references from former employers
 were required and as she had never been employed, she was asked
 for recommendations from the principal of her school. These, of
 course, she could not supply. The stores of the better class had
 nothing to offer her except to put her name on the waiting-list.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Finally Rose secured a place in a second-rate establishment on
 Main Street. The work was hard; it necessitated long hours and
 continual standing on her feet. Rose was not rugged enough to
 accustom herself to the work all at once, and she was discharged.
 This disheartened her, but she kept on trying to find other
 employment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One day in the shopping district, some one accosted her. She
 looked up to see a young man, slim, elegant, with a curl of his
 lips she remembered. He raised his hat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you do, Mr. Swann," she answered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, are you on the way home?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's go down this side street," he said, throwing away his
 cigarette. "I've been looking for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They turned the corner. Rose felt strange to be walking alone
 with him, but she was not embarrassed. He had danced with her
 once. And she knew his friend Hardy Mackay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What're you crying about?" he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm not."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You have been then. What for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, nothing."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, tell me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I've been disappointed."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What about?" He was persistent, and Rose felt that he must be
 used to having his own way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was about a job I didn't get," replied Rose, trying to laugh.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you're looking for a job. Heard you'd been fired by old Hill.
 Gail told me. I had her out last night in my new car."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I could go back to school. Miss Hill sent for me.... Was Bessy
 with you and Gail?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. Gail and I were alone. We had a dandy time.... Rose, will
 you meet me some night and take a ride? It'll be fine and cool."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Mr. Swann. It's very kind of you to ask me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, will you go?" he queried, impatiently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she replied, simply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't want to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, that's plain enough," he said, changing his tone. "Say,
 Rose, you're in Clark's store, aren't you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I was. But I lost the place."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I couldn't stand on my feet all day. I fainted. Then he fired
 me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So you're hunting for another job?" inquired Swann,
 thoughtfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry. It's too bad a sweet kid like you has to work. You're not
 strong, Rose.... Well, I'll turn off at this corner. You won't
 meet me to-night?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, thanks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann pulled a gold case from his pocket, and extracting a
 cigarette, tilted it in his lips as he struck a match. His face
 wore a careless smile Rose did not like. He was amiable, but he
 seemed so sure, so satisfied, almost as if he believed she would
 change her mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, you're turning me down cold, then?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take it any way you like, Mr. Swann," she replied. "Good day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose forgot him almost the instant her back was turned. He had
 only annoyed her. And she had her stepfather to face, with news
 of her discharge from the store. Her fears were verified; he
 treated her brutally. Next day Rose went to work in a laundry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And then, very soon it seemed, her school days, the merry times
 with the boys, and Bessy?all were far back in the past. She
 did not meet any one who knew her, nor hear from any one. They
 had forgotten her. At night, after coming home from the laundry
 and doing the housework, she was so tired that she was glad to
 crawl into bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But one night a boy brought her a note. It was from Dick Swann.
 He asked her to go to Mendleson's Hall to see the
 moving-pictures. She could meet him uptown at the entrance. Rose
 told the boy to tell Swann she would not come.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This invitation made her thoughtful. If Swann had been ashamed to
 be seen with her he would not have invited her to go there.
 Mendleson's was a nice place; all the nice people of Middleville
 went there. Rose found herself thinking of the lights, the music,
 the well-dressed crowd, and then the pictures. She loved
 moving-pictures, especially those with swift horses and cowboys
 and a girl who could ride. All at once a wave of the old
 thrilling excitement rushed over her. Almost she regretted having
 sent back a refusal. But she would not go with Swann. And it was
 not because she knew what kind of a young man he was?what
 he wanted. Rose refused from dislike, not scruples.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then came a Saturday night which seemed a climax of her troubles.
 She was told not to come back to work until further notice, and
 that was as bad as being discharged. How could she tell her
 stepfather? Of late he had been hard with her. She dared not tell
 him. The money she earned was little enough, but during his
 idleness it had served to keep them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose had scarcely gone a block when she encountered Dick Swann.
 He stopped her?turned to walk with her. It was a melancholy
 gift of Rose's that she could tell when men were even in the
 slightest under the influence of drink. Swann was not careless
 now or indifferent. He seemed excited and gay.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose, you're just the girl I'm looking for," he said. "I really
 was going to your home. Got that job yet?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got one for you. It's at the Telephone Exchange. They need
 an operator. My dad owns the telephone company. I've got a pull.
 I'll get you the place. You can learn it easy. Nice
 job?short hours?you sit down all the time?good
 pay. What do you say, Rose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I don't know?what to say," she faltered. "Thanks
 for thinking of me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've had you in mind for a month. Rose, you take this job. Take
 it whether you've any use for me or not. I'm not rotten enough to
 put this in your way just to make you under obligations to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll think about it. I?I do need a place. My father's out
 of work. And he's?he's not easy to get along with."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tell you what, Rose. You meet me to-night. We'll take a spin
 in my car. It'll be fine down the river road. Then we can talk it
 over. Will you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose looked at him, and thought how strange it was that she did
 not like him any better, now when she ought to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why have you tried to?to rush me?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I like you, Rose."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you don't want me to meet you?go with you, when
 I?I can't feel as you do?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure, I want you to, Rose. Nobody ever likes me right off. Maybe
 you will, after you know me. The job is yours. Don't make any
 date with me for that. I say here's your chance to have a ride,
 to win a friend. Take it or not. It's up to you. I won't say
 another word."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose's hungry, lonely heart warmed toward Swann. He seemed like a
 ray of light in the gloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll meet you," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They arranged the hour and then she went on her way home.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The big car sped through River Park. Rose shivered a little as
 she peered into the darkness of the grove. Then the car shot
 under the last electric light, out into the country, with the
 level road white in the moonlight, and the river gleaming below.
 There was a steady, even rush of wind. The car hummed and droned
 and sang. And mingled with the dry scent of dust was the sweet
 fragrance of new-mown hay. Far off a light twinkled or it might
 have been a star.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann put his arm around Rose. She did not shrink?she did
 not repulse him?she did not move. Something strange
 happened in her mind or heart. It was that moment she fell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And she fell wide-eyed, knowing what she was doing, not in a
 fervor of excitement, without pleasure or passion, bitterly sure
 that it was better to be with some one she could not like than to
 be alone forever. The wrong to herself lay only in the fact that
 she could not care.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Toward the end of June, Lane's long vigil of watchfulness from
 the vantage-point at Colonel Pepper's apartment resulted in a
 confirmation of his worst fears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One afternoon and evening of a warm, close day in early summer he
 lay and crouched on the attic floor above the club-rooms from
 three o'clock until one the next morning. From time to time he
 had changed his position to rest. But at the expiration of that
 protracted period of spying he was so exhausted from the physical
 strain and mental shock that he was unable to go home. All the
 rest of the night he lay upon Colonel Pepper's couch, wide awake,
 consumed by pain and distress. About daylight he fell into a
 sleep, fitful and full of nightmares, to be awakened around nine
 o'clock by Pepper. The old gambler evinced considerable alarm
 until Lane explained how he happened to be there; and then his
 feeling changed to solicitude.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you look awful," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I look the way I feel it's no wonder you're shocked,"
 returned Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ahuh! What'd you see?" queried the other, curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you numskull, while you were peepin' all that time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane sombrely shook his head. "I couldn't tell?what I saw.
 I want to forget.... Maybe in twenty-four hours I'll believe it
 was a nightmare."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Humph! Well, I'm here to tell you what <i>I've</i> seen wasn't
 any nightmare," returned Pepper, with his shrewd gaze on Lane.
 "But we needn't discuss that. If it made an old bum like me sick
 what might not it do to a sensitive high-minded chap like you....
 The question is are you going to bust up that club."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am," declared Lane, grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! But how?when? What's the sense in lettin' them carry
 on any longer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I had to fight myself last night to keep from breaking in on
 them.... But I want to catch this fellow Swann with my sister.
 She wasn't there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, don't wait for that," returned Pepper, nervously. "You
 might never catch him.... And if you did...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His little plump well-cared-for hand shook as he extended it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't know what I'll do.... I don't know," said Lane, darkly,
 more to himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, this?this worry will knock you out."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No matter. All I ask is to stand up?long enough?to
 do what I want to do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go home and get some breakfast?and take care of yourself,"
 replied Pepper, gruffly. "Damn me if I'm not sorry I gave Swann's
 secret away."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh no, you're not," said Lane, quickly. "But I'd have found it
 out by this time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Pepper paced up and down the faded carpet, his hands behind his
 back, a plodding, burdened figure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you any?doubts left?" he asked, suddenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doubts!" echoed Lane, vaguely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?doubts. You're like most of these mothers and
 fathers.... You couldn't believe. You made excuses for the
 smoke?saying there was no fire."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No more doubts, alas!... My God! I <i>saw</i>," burst out Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "All right. Buck up now. It's something to be sure.... You've
 overdone your strength. You look...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pepper, do me a favor," interposed Lane, as he made for the
 door. "Get me an axe and leave it here in your rooms. In case I
 want to break in on those fellows some
 time?quick?I'll have it ready."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure, I'll get you anything. And I want to be around when you
 butt in on them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's up to you. Good-bye now. I'll run in to-morrow if I'm up
 to it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went home, his mind in a tumult. His mother had just
 discovered that he had not slept in his bed, and was greatly
 relieved to see him. Breakfast was waiting, and after partaking
 of it Lane felt somewhat better. His mother appeared more than
 usually sombre. Worry was killing her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna did not sleep at home last night," she said, presently, as
 if reluctantly forced to impart this information.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where was she?" he queried, blankly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She said she would stay with a friend."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What friend?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some girl. Oh, it's all right I suppose. She's stayed away
 before with girl friends.... But what worried me...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well," queried Lane, as she paused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna was angry again last night. And she told me if you didn't
 stop your nagging she'd go away from home and stay. Said she
 could afford to pay her board."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She told me that, too," replied Lane, slowly. "And?I'm
 afraid she meant it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Leave her alone, Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Poor mother! I'm afraid I'm a?a worry to you as well as
 Lorna," he said, gently, with a hand going to her worn cheek. She
 said nothing, although her glance rested upon him with sad
 affection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane clambered wearily up to his little room. It had always been
 a refuge. He leaned a moment against the wall, and felt in his
 extremity like an animal in a trap. A thousand pricking, rushing
 sensations seemed to be on the way to his head. That confusion,
 that sensation as if his blood vessels would burst, yielded to
 his will. He sat down on his bed. Only the physical pains and
 weariness, and the heartsickness abided with him. These had been
 nothing to daunt his spirit. But to-day was different. The dark,
 vivid, terrible picture in his mind unrolled like a page.
 Yesterday was different. To-day he seemed a changed man,
 confronted by imperious demands. Time was driving onward fast.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As if impelled by a dark and sinister force, he slowly leaned
 down to pull his bag from under the bed. He opened it, and drew
 out his Colt's automatic gun. Though the June day was warm this
 big worn metal weapon had a cold touch. He did not feel that he
 wanted to handle it, but he did. It seemed heavy, a thing of
 subtle, latent energy, with singular fascination for him. It
 brought up a dark flowing tide of memory. Lane shut his eyes, and
 saw the tide flow by with its conflict and horror. The feel of
 his gun, and the recall of what it had meant to him in terrible
 hours, drove away a wavering of will, and a still voice that
 tried to pierce his consciousness. It fixed his sinister
 intention. He threw the gun on the bed, and rising began to pace
 the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I told what I saw?no jury on earth would convict me,"
 he soliloquized. "But I'll kill him?and keep my mouth
 shut."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Plan after plan he had pondered in mind?and talked over
 with Blair?something to thwart Richard Swann?to give
 Margaret the chance for happiness and love her heart
 craved?to put out of Lorna's way the evil influence that
 had threatened her. Now the solution came to him. Sooner or later
 he would catch Swann with his sister in an automobile, or at the
 club rooms, or at some other questionable place. He knew Lorna
 was meeting Swann. He had tried to find them, all to no avail.
 What he might have done heretofore was no longer significant; he
 knew what he meant to do now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But all at once Lane was confronted with remembrance of another
 thing he had resolved upon?equally as strong as his
 determination to save Lorna?and it was his intention to
 persuade Mel Iden to marry him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He loved his sister, but not as he loved Mel Iden. Whatever had
 happened to Lorna or might happen, she would be equal to it. She
 had the boldness, the cool, calculating selfishness of the
 general run of modern girls. Her reactions were vastly different
 front Mel Iden's. Lane had lost hope of saving Lorna's soul. He
 meant only to remove a baneful power from her path, so that she
 might lean to the boy who wanted to marry her. When in his
 sinister intent he divined the passionate hate of the soldier for
 the slacker he refused to listen to his conscience. The way out
 in Lorna's case he had discovered. But what relation had this new
 factor of his dilemma to Mel Iden? He could never marry her after
 he had killed Swann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went to bed, and when he rested his spent body, he pondered
 over every phase of the case. Reason and intelligence had their
 say. He knew he had become morbid, sick, rancorous, base,
 obsessed with this iniquity and his passion to stamp on it, as if
 it were a venomous serpent. He would have liked to do some
 magnificent and awful deed, that would show this little, narrow,
 sordid world at home the truth, and burn forever on their
 memories the spirit of a soldier. He had made a sacrifice that
 few understood. He had no reward except a consciousness that grew
 more luminous and glorious in its lonely light as time went on.
 He had endured the uttermost agonies of hell, a thousand times
 worse than death, and he had come home with love, with his faith
 still true. To what had he returned?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No need for reason or intelligence to knock at the gates of his
 passion! The war had left havoc. The physical, the sensual, the
 violent, the simian?these instincts, engendering the Day of
 the Beast, had come to dominate the people he had fought for. Why
 not go out and deliberately kill a man, a libertine, a slacker?
 He would still be acting on the same principle that imbued him
 during the war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His thoughts drifted to Mel Iden. Strange how he loved her! Why?
 Because she was a lonely soul like himself?because she was
 true to her womanhood?because she had fallen for the same
 principle for which he had sacrificed all?because she had
 been abandoned by family and friends?because she had become
 beautiful, strange, mystic, tragic. Because despite the unnamed
 child, the scarlet letter upon her breast, she seemed to him
 infinitely purer than the girl who had jilted him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane now surrendered to the enchantment of emotion embodied in
 the very name of Mel Iden. He had long resisted a sweet,
 melancholy current. He had driven Mel from his mind by bitter
 reflection on the conduct of the people who had ostracized her.
 Thought of her now, of what he meant to do, of the mounting love
 he had so strangely come to feel for her, was his only source of
 happiness. She would never know his secret love; he could never
 tell her that. But it was something to hold to his heart, besides
 that unquenchable faith in himself, in some unseen genius for
 far-off good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The next day Lane, having ascertained where Joshua Iden was
 employed, betook himself that way just at the noon hour. Iden,
 like so many other Middleville citizens, gained a livelihood by
 working for the rich Swann. In his best days he had been a master
 mechanic of the railroad shops; at sixty he was foreman of one of
 the steel mills.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As it chanced, Iden had finished his noonday meal and was resting
 in the shade, apart from other laborers there. Lane remembered
 him, in spite of the fact that the three years had aged and bowed
 him, and lined his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Iden, do you remember me?" asked Lane. He caught the slight
 averting of Iden's eyes from his uniform, and divined how the
 father of Mel Iden hated soldiers. But nothing could daunt Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Lane, I remember you," returned Iden. He returned Lane's
 hand-clasp, but not cordially.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had mapped out in his mind this little interview. Taking off
 his hat, he carefully lowered himself until his back was propped
 against the tree, and looked frankly at Iden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's warm. And I tire so easily. The damned Huns cut me to
 pieces.... Not much like I was when I used to call on Mel!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Iden lowered his shadowed face. After a moment he said: "No,
 you're changed, Lane.... I heard you were gassed, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, everything came my way, Mr. Iden.... And the finish isn't
 far off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Iden shifted his legs uneasily, then sat more erect, and for the
 first time really looked at Lane. It was the glance of a man who
 had strong aversion to the class Lane represented, but who was
 fair-minded and just, and not without sympathy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's too bad, Lane. You're a young man.... The war hit us all,
 I guess," he said, and at the last, sighed heavily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's been a long pull?Blair Maynard and I were the first
 to enlist, and we left Middleville almost immediately," went on
 Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He desired to plant in Iden's mind the fact that he had left
 Middleville long before the wild era of soldier-and-girl
 attraction which had created such havoc. Acutely sensitive as
 Lane was, he could not be sure of an alteration in Iden's
 aloofness, yet there was some slight change. Then he talked
 frankly about specific phases of the war. Finally, when he saw
 that he had won interest and sympathy from Iden he abruptly
 launched his purpose.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Iden, I came to ask if you will give your consent to my
 marrying Mel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The older man shrank back as if he had been struck. He stared.
 His lower jaw dropped. A dark flush reddened his cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!... Lane, you must be drunk," he ejaculated, thickly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I never was more earnest in my life. I want to marry Mel
 Iden."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?" rasped out the father, hoarsely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I understand Mel," replied Lane, and swiftly he told his
 convictions as to the meaning and cause of her sacrifice. "Mel is
 good. She never was bad. These rotten people who see dishonor and
 disgrace in her have no minds, no hearts. Mel is far above these
 painted, bare-kneed girls who scorn her.... And I want to show
 them what <i>I</i> think of her. I want to give her boy a
 name?so he'll have a chance in the world. I'll not live
 long. This is just a little thing I can do to make it easier for
 Mel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you can't be the father of her child," burst out Iden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I wish I were. I was never anything to Mel but a friend. She
 was only a girl?seventeen when I left home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So help me God!" muttered Iden, and he covered his face with his
 hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say yes, Mr. Iden, and I'll go to Mel this afternoon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, let me think.... Lane, if you're not drunk, you're crazy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not at all. Why, Mr. Iden, I'm perfectly rational. Why, I'd
 glory in making that splendid girl a little happier, if it's
 possible."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I drove my?my girl from her mother?her home," said
 Iden, slowly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and it was a hard, cruel act," replied Lane, sharply. "You
 were wrong. You?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The mill whistle cut short Lane's further speech. When its shrill
 clarion ended, Iden got up, and shook himself as if to
 reestablish himself in the present.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you come to my house to-night," he said. "I've got to go
 back to work.... But I'll think?and we can talk it over. I
 still live where you used to come as a boy.... How strange life
 is!... Good day, Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane felt more than satisfied with the result of that interview.
 Joshua Iden would go home and tell Mel's mother, and that would
 surely make the victory easier. She would be touched in her
 mother's heart; she would understand Mel now, and divine Lane's
 mission; and she would plead with her husband to consent, and to
 bring Mel back home. Lane was counting on that. He must never
 even hint such a hope, but nevertheless he had it, he believed in
 it. Joshua Iden would have the scales torn from his eyes. He
 would never have it said that a dying soldier, who owed neither
 him nor his daughter anything, had shown more charity than he.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Therefore, Lane went early to the Iden homestead, a picturesque
 cottage across the river from Riverside Park. The only change
 Lane noted was a larger growth of trees and a fuller foliage. It
 was warm twilight. The frogs had begun to trill, sweet and
 melodious sound to Lane, striking melancholy chords of memory.
 Joshua Iden was walking on his lawn, his coat off, his gray head
 uncovered. Mrs. Iden sat on the low-roofed porch. Lane expected
 to see a sad change in her, something the same as he had found in
 his own mother. But he was hardly prepared for the frail,
 white-haired woman unlike the image he carried in his mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane! You should have come to see me long ago," was her
 greeting, and in her voice, so like Mel's, Lane recognized her.
 Some fitting reply came to him, and presently the moment seemed
 easier for all. She asked about his mother and Lorna, and then
 about Blair Maynard. But she did not speak of his own health or
 condition. And presently Lane thought it best to come to the
 issue at hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Iden, have you made up your mind to?to give me what I
 want?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I have, Lane," replied Iden, simply. "You've made me see
 what Mel's mother always believed, though she couldn't make it
 clear to me.... I have much to forgive that girl. Yet, if you,
 who owe her nothing?who have wasted your life in vain
 sacrifice?if you can ask her to be your wife, I can ask her
 to come back home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That was a splendid, all-satisfying moment for Lane. By his own
 grief he measured his reward. What had counted with Joshua Iden
 had been his faith in Mel's innate goodness. Then Lane turned to
 the mother. In the dusk he could see the working of her sad face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God bless you, my boy!" she said. "You feel with a woman's
 heart. I thank you.... Joshua has already sent word for Mel to
 come home. She will be back to-morrow.... You must come here to
 see her. But, Daren, she will never marry you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She will," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You do not know Mel. Even if you had only a day to live she
 would not let you wrong yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But when she learns how much it means to me? The army ruined
 Mel, as it ruined hundreds of thousands of other girls. She will
 let one soldier make it up to her. She will let me go to my death
 with less bitterness."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my poor boy, I don't know?I can't tell," she replied,
 brokenly. "By God's goodness you have brought about one miracle.
 Who knows? You might change Mel. For you have brought something
 great back from the war."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mrs. Iden, I will persuade her to marry me," said Lane. "And
 then, Mr. Iden, we must see what is best for her and the
 boy?in the future."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Aye, son. One lesson learned makes other lessons easy. I will
 take Mel and her mother far away from Middleville?where no
 one ever heard of us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good! You can all touch happiness again.... And now, if you and
 Mrs. Iden will excuse me?I will go."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane bade the couple good night, and slowly, as might have a lame
 man, he made his way through the gloaming, out to the road, and
 down to the bridge, where as always he lingered to catch the
 mystic whispers of the river waters, meant only for his ear.
 Stronger to-night! He was closer to that nameless thing. The
 shadows of dusk, the dark murmuring river, held an account with
 him, sometime to be paid. How blessed to fall, to float down to
 that merciful oblivion.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Several days passed before Lane felt himself equal to the
 momentous interview with Mel Iden. After his call upon Mel's
 father and mother he was overcome by one of his sick, weak
 spells, that happily had been infrequent of late. This one
 confined him to his room. He had about fought and won it out,
 when the old injury at the base of his spine reminded him that
 misfortunes did not come singly. Quite unexpectedly, as he bent
 over with less than his usual caution, the vertebra slipped out;
 and Lane found his body twisted like a letter S. And the old pain
 was no less terrible for its familiarity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He got back to his bed and called his mother. She sent for Doctor
 Bronson. He came at once, and though solicitous and kind he
 lectured Lane for neglecting the osteopathic treatment he had
 advised. And he sent his chauffeur for an osteopath.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane," said the little physician, peering severely down upon
 him, "I didn't think you'd last as long as this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm tough, Doctor?hard to kill," returned Lane, making a
 wry face. "But I couldn't stand this pain long."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'll be easier presently. We can fix that spine. Some good
 treatments to strengthen ligaments, and a brace to wear?we
 can fix that.... Lane, you've wonderful vitality."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A doctor in France told me that."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Except for your mental condition, you're in better shape now
 than when you came home." Doctor Bronson peered at Lane from
 under his shaggy brows, walked to the window, looked out, and
 returned, evidently deep in thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy, what's on your mind?" he queried, suddenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Lord! listen to him," sighed Lane. Then he laughed. "My dear
 Doctor, I have nothing on my mind?absolutely nothing....
 This world is a beautiful place. Middleville is fine, clean,
 progressive. People are kind?thoughtful?good. What
 could I have on my mind?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You can't fool me. You think the opposite of what you say....
 Lane, your heart is breaking."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Doctor. It broke long ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You believe so, but it didn't. You can't give up.... Lane, I
 want to tell you something. I'm a prohibitionist myself, and I
 respect the law. But there are rare cases where whiskey will
 effect a cure. I say that as a physician. And I am convinced now
 that your case is one where whiskey might give you a fighting
 chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor! What're you saying?" ejaculated Lane, wide-eyed with
 incredulity.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson enlarged upon and emphasized his statement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I might <i>live</i>!" whispered Lane. "My God!... But that is
 ridiculous. I'm shot to pieces. I'm really tired of living. And I
 certainly wouldn't become a drunkard to save my life."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this juncture the osteopath entered, putting an end to that
 intimate conversation. Doctor Bronson explained the case to his
 colleague. And fifteen minutes later Lane's body was again
 straight. Also he was wringing wet with cold sweat and quivering
 in every muscle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gentlemen?your cure is?worse than?the
 disease," he panted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Manifestly Doctor Branson's interest in Lane had advanced beyond
 the professional. His tone was one of friendship when he said,
 "Boy, it beats hell what you can stand. I don't know about you.
 Stop your worry now. Isn't there something you <i>care</i> for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Think of that, or it, or <i>her</i>, then to the exclusion of
 all else. And give nature a chance."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor, I can't control my thoughts."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A fellow like you can do anything," snapped Bronson. "There are
 such men, now and then. Human nature is strange and manifold. All
 great men do not have statues erected in their honor. Most of
 them are unknown, unsung.... Lane, you could do anything?do
 you hear me??<i>anything</i>."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane felt surprise at the force and passion of the practical
 little physician. But he was not greatly impressed. And he was
 glad when the two men went away. He felt the insidious approach
 of one of his states of depression?the black mood?the
 hopeless despair?the hell on earth. This spell had not
 visited him often of late, and now manifestly meant to make up
 for that forbearance. Lane put forth his intelligence, his
 courage, his spirit?all in vain. The onslaught of gloom and
 anguish was irresistible. Then thought of Mel Iden sustained
 him?held back this madness for the moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every hour he lived made her dearer, yet farther away. It was the
 unattainableness of her, the impossibility of a fruition of love
 that slowly and surely removed her. On the other hand, the image
 of her sweet face, of her form, of her beauty, of her
 movements?every recall of these physical things enhanced
 her charm, and his love. He had cherished a delusion that it was
 Mel Iden's spirit alone, the wonderful soul of her, that had
 stormed his heart and won it. But he found to his consternation
 that however he revered her soul, it was the woman also who now
 allured him. That moment of revelation to Lane was a catastrophe.
 Was there no peace on earth for him? What had he done to be so
 tortured? He had a secret he must hide from Mel Iden. He was
 human, he was alone, he needed love, but this seemed madness. And
 at the moment of full realization Doctor Bronson's strange words
 of possibility returned to haunt and flay him. He might live! A
 fierce thrill like a flame leaped from his heart, along his
 veins. And a shudder, cold as ice, followed it. Love would kill
 his resignation. Love would add to his despair. Mel Iden could
 never love him. He did not want her love. And yet, to live on and
 on, with such love as would swell and mount from his agony, with
 the barrier between them growing more terrible every day, was
 more than he cared to face. He would rather die.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And so, at length, Lane's black demon of despair overthrew even
 his thoughts of Mel, and fettered him there, in darkness and
 strife of soul. He was an atom under the grinding, monstrous
 wheels of his morbid mood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sometime, after endless moments or hours of lying there, with
 crushed breast, with locked thoughts hideous and forlorn, with
 slow burn of pang and beat of heart, Lane heard a heavy thump on
 the porch outside, on the hall inside, on the stairs.
 Thump?thump, slow and heavy! It roused him. It drove away
 the drowsy, thick and thunderous atmosphere of mind. It had a
 familiar sound. Blair's crutch!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently there was a knock on the door of his room and Blair
 entered. Blair, as always, bright of eye, smiling of lip, erect,
 proud, self-sufficient, inscrutable and sure. Lane's black demon
 stole away. Lane saw that Blair was whiter, thinner, frailer, a
 little farther on that road from which there could be no turning.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, old scout," greeted Blair, as he sat down on the bed
 beside Lane. "I need you more than any one?but it kills me
 to see you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Same here, Blair," replied Lane, comprehendingly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gosh! we oughtn't be so finicky about each other's looks,"
 exclaimed Blair, with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But neither Lane nor Blair made further reference to the subject.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Each from the other assimilated some force, from voice and look
 and presence, something wanting in their contact with others.
 These two had measured all emotions, spanned in little time the
 extremes of life, plumbed the depths, and now saw each other on
 the heights. In the presence of Blair, Lane felt an exaltation.
 The more Blair seemed to fade away from life, the more luminous
 and beautiful the light of his countenance. For Lane the crippled
 and dying Blair was a deed of valor done, a wrong expiated for
 the sake of others, a magnificent nobility in contrast to the
 baseness and greed and cowardice of the self-preservation that
 had doomed him. Lane had only to look at Blair to feel something
 elevating in himself, to know beyond all doubt that the goodness,
 the truth, the progress of man in nature, and of God in his soul,
 must grow on forever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel Iden had been in her home four days when Lane first saw her
 there.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a day late in June when the rich, thick, amber light of
 afternoon seemed to float in the air. Warm summer lay on the
 land. The bees were humming in the rose vines over the porch.
 Mrs. Iden, who evidently heard Lane's step, appeared in the path,
 and nodding her gladness at sight of him, she pointed to the open
 door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane halted on the threshold. The golden light of the day seemed
 to have entered the room and found Mel. It warmed the pallor of
 her skin and the whiteness of her dress. When he had seen her
 before she had worn something plain and dark. Could a white gown
 and the golden glow of June effect such transformation? She came
 slowly toward him and took his hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I am home," was all she could say.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Long hours before Lane had braced himself for this ordeal. It was
 himself he had feared, not Mel. He played the part he had created
 for her imagination. Behind his composure, his grave, kind
 earnestness, hid the subdued and scorned and unwelcome love that
 had come to him. He held it down, surrounded, encompassed,
 clamped, so that he dared look into her eyes, listen to her
 voice, watch the sweet and tragic tremulousness of her lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Mel, where you should be," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was you?your offer to marry me?that melted
 father's heart."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, all he needed was to be made think," returned Lane. "And
 that was how I made him do it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren, I thank you, for mother's sake, for mine?I
 can't tell you how much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, please don't thank me," he answered. "You understand, and
 that's enough. Now say you'll marry me, Mel."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel did not answer, but in the look of her eyes, dark, humid,
 with mysterious depths below the veil, Lane saw the truth; he
 felt it in the clasp of her hands, he divined it in all that so
 subtly emanated from the womanliness of her. Mel had come to love
 him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And all that he had endured seemed to rise and envelop heart and
 soul in a strange, cold stillness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, will you marry me?" he repeated, almost dully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Slowly Mel withdrew her hands. The query seemed to make her
 mistress of herself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Daren, I cannot," she replied, and turned away to look out
 of a window with unseeing eyes. "Let us talk of other things....
 My father says he will move away?taking me
 and?and?all of us?as soon as he sells the
 home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Mel, if you'll forgive me, we'll not talk of something
 else," Lane informed her. "We can argue without quarreling. Come
 over here and sit down."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She came slowly, as if impelled, and she stood before him. To
 Lane it seemed as if she were both supplicating and inexorable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you remember the last time we sat together on this couch?"
 she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Mel, I don't."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was four years ago?and more. I was sixteen. You tried
 to kiss me and were angry because I wouldn't let you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, wasn't I rude!" he exclaimed, facetiously. Then he grew
 serious. "Mel, do you remember it was Helen's lying that came
 between you and me?as boy and girl friends?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I never knew. Helen Wrapp! What was it?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's not worth recalling and would hurt you?now," he
 replied. "But it served to draw me Helen's way. We were engaged
 when she was seventeen.... Then came the war. And the other night
 she laughed in my face because I was a wreck.... Mel, it's beyond
 understanding how things work out. Helen has chosen the fleshpots
 of Egypt. You have chosen a lonelier and higher path.... And here
 I am in your little parlor asking you to marry me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, no! Daren, don't, I beg of you?don't talk to me
 this way," she besought him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, it's a difference of opinion that makes arguments, wars and
 other things," he said, with a cruelty in strange antithesis to
 the pity and tenderness he likewise felt. He could hurt her. He
 had power over her. What a pang shot through his heart! There
 would be an irresistible delight in playing on the emotions of
 this woman. He could no more help it than the shame that surged
 over him at consciousness of his littleness. He already loved
 her, she was all he had left to love, he would end in a day or a
 week or a month by worshipping her. Through her he was going to
 suffer. Peace would now never abide in his soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you were never like this?as a boy," she said, in
 wondering distress.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Like what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're hard. You used to be so?so gentle and nice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hard! I? Yes, Mel, perhaps I am?hard as war, hard as
 modern life, hard as my old friends, my little
 sister??" he broke off.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, do not mock me," she entreated. "I should not have said
 hard. But you're strange to me?a something terrible flashes
 from you. Yet it's only in glimpses.... Forgive me, Daren, I
 didn't mean hard."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane drew her down upon the couch so that she faced him, and he
 did not release her hand.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I'm softer than a jelly-fish," he said. "I've no bone, no
 fiber, no stamina, no substance. I'm more unstable than water.
 I'm so soft I'm weak. I can't stand pain. I lie awake in the dead
 hours of night and I cry like a baby, like a fool. I weep for
 myself, for my mother, for Lorna, for <i>you</i>...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush!" She put a soft hand over his lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, I'll not be bitter," he went on, with mounting pulse,
 with thrill and rush of inexplicable feeling, as if at last had
 come the person who would not be deaf to his voice. "Mel, I'm
 still the boy, your schoolmate, who used to pull the bow off your
 braid.... I am that boy still in heart, with all the war upon my
 head, with the years between then and now. I'm young and old....
 I've lived the whole gamut?the fresh call of war to youth,
 glorious, but God! as false as stairs of sand?the change of
 blood, hard, long, brutal, debasing labor of hands, of body, of
 mind to learn to kill?to survive and kill?and go on
 to kill.... I've seen the marching of thousands of
 soldiers?the long strange tramp, tramp, tramp, the beat,
 beat, beat, the roll of drums, the call of bugles, the boom of
 cannon in the dark, the lightnings of hell flaring across the
 midnight skies, the thunder and chaos and torture and death and
 pestilence and decay?the hell of war. It is not sublime.
 There is no glory. The sublimity is in man's acceptance of war,
 not for hate or gain, but love. Love of country, home,
 family?love of women?I fought for women?for
 Helen, whom I imagined my ideal, breaking her heart over me on
 the battlefield. Not that Helen failed <i>me</i>, but failed the
 ideal for which I fought!... My little sister Lorna! I fought for
 her, and I fought for a dream that existed only in my heart.
 Lorna?Alas!... I fought for other women, all
 women?and <i>you</i>, Mel Iden. And in you, in your
 sacrifice and your strength to endure, I find something healing
 to my sore heart. I find my ideal embodied in you. I find hope
 and faith for the future embodied in you. I find?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh Daren, you shame me utterly," she protested, freeing her
 hands in gesture of entreaty. "I am outcast."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To a false and rotten society, yes?you are," he returned.
 "But Mel, that society is a mass of maggots. It is such women as
 you, such men as Blair, who carry the spirit onward.... So much
 for that. I have spoken to try to show you where I hold you. I do
 not call your?your trouble a blunder, or downfall, or
 dishonor. I call it a misfortune because?because?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because there was not love," she supplemented, as he halted at
 fault. "Yes, that is where I wronged myself, my soul. I obeyed
 nature and nature is strong, raw, inevitable. She seeks only her
 end, which is concerned with the species. For nature the
 individual perishes. Nature cannot be God. For God has created a
 soul in woman. And through the ages woman has advanced to hold
 her womanhood sacred. But ever the primitive lurks in the blood,
 and the primitive is nature. Soul and nature are not compatible.
 A woman's soul sanctions only love. That is the only progress
 there ever was in life. Nature and war made me traitor to my
 soul."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, yes, Mel, it's true?and cruel, what you say,"
 returned Lane. "All the more reason why you should do what I ask.
 I am home after the war. All that was vain <i>is</i> vain. I
 forget it when I can. I have?not a great while left. There
 are a few things even I can do before that time. One of
 them?the biggest to me?concerns you. You are in
 trouble. You have a boy who can be spared much unhappiness in
 life. If you were married?if the boy had my name?how
 different the future! Perhaps there can be some measure of
 happiness for you. For him there is every hope. You will leave
 Middleville. You will go far away somewhere. You are young. You
 have a good education. You can teach school, or help your parents
 while the boy is growing up. Time is kind. You will forget....
 Marry me, Mel, for his sake."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She had both hands pressed to her breast as if to stay an
 uncontrollable feeling. Her eyes, dilated and wide, expressed a
 blending of emotions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, no, no!" she cried.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went on just the same with other words, in other vein,
 reiterating the same importunity. It was a tragic game, in which
 he divined he must lose. But the playing of it had inexplicably
 bitter-sweet pain. He knew now that Mel loved him. No greater
 proof needed he than the perception of her reaction to one word
 on his lips?wife. She quivered to that like a tautly strung
 lyre touched by a skilful hand. It fascinated her. But the
 temptation to accept his offer for the sake of her boy's future
 was counteracted by the very strength of her feeling for Lane.
 She would not marry him, because she loved him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane read this truth, and it wrung a deeper reverence from him.
 And he saw, too, the one way in which he could break her spirit,
 make her surrender, if he could stoop to it. If he could take her
 in his arms, and hold her tight, and kiss her dumb and blind, and
 make her understand his own love for her, his need of her, she
 would accede with the wondrous generosity of a woman's heart. But
 he could not do it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the end, out of sheer pity that overcame the strange delight
 he had in torturing her, he desisted in his appeals and demands
 and subtle arguments. The long strain left him spent. And with
 the sudden let-down of his energy, the surrender to her stronger
 will, he fell prey at once to the sadness that more and more was
 encompassing him. He felt an old and broken man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To this sudden change in Lane Mel responded with mute anxiety and
 fear. The alteration of his spirit stunned her. As he bade her
 good-bye she clung to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, forgive me," she implored. "You don't understand.... Oh,
 it's hard."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind, Mel. I guess it was just one of my dreams. Don't
 cry.... Good-bye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But you'll come again?" she entreated, almost wildly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane shook his head. He did not trust himself to look at her
 then.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you can't mean that," she cried. "It's too late for me.
 I?I?Oh! You.... To uplift me?then to cast me
 down! Daren, come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In his heart he did not deny that cry of hers. He knew he would
 come back, knew it with stinging shame, but he could not tell
 her. It had all turned out so differently from what he had
 dreamed. If he had not loved her he would not have felt defeat.
 To have made her his wife would have been to protect her, to
 possess her even after he was dead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the last she let him go. He felt her watching him, and he
 carried her lingering clasp away with him, to burn and to thrill
 and to haunt, and yet to comfort him in lonely hours.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the next day the old spirit resurged anew, and unreconciled
 to defeat, he turned to what was left him. Foolish and futile
 hopes! To bank on the single grain of good in his wayward
 sister's heart! To trust the might of his spirit?to beat
 down the influence of an intolerant and depraved young
 millionaire?verily he was mad. Yet he believed. And as a
 final resort he held death in his hand. Richard Swann swaggered
 by Lane that night in the billiard room of the Bradford Inn and
 stared sneeringly at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've got a date," he gayly said to his sycophantic friends, in a
 tone that would reach Lane's ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The summer night came when Lane drove a hired car out the river
 road, keeping ever in sight a red light in front of him. He broke
 the law and endangered his life by traveling with darkened lamps.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a crescent moon, clear and exquisitely delicate in the
 darkening blue sky. The gleaming river shone winding away under
 the dusky wooded hills. The white road stretched ahead, dimming
 in the distance. A night for romance and love?for a maiden
 at a stile and a lover who hung rapt and humble upon her
 whispers! But that red eye before him held no romance. It leered
 as the luxurious sedan swayed from side to side, a diabolical
 thing with speed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was driving out the state highway, mile after mile. He
 calculated that in less than ten minutes Swann had taken a girl
 from a bustling corner of Middleville out into the open country.
 In pleasant weather, when the roads were good, cars like Swann's
 swerved off into the bypaths, into the edge of woods. In bad
 weather they parked along the highway, darkened their lights and
 pulled their blinds. For this, great factories turned out
 automobiles. And there might have pealed out to a nation, and to
 God, the dolorous cry of a hundred thousand ruined girls! But who
 would hear? And on the lips of girls of the present there was
 only the wild cry for excitement, for the nameless and unknown!
 There was a girl in Swann's car and Lane believed it was his
 sister. Night after night he had watched. Once he had actually
 seen Lorna ride off with Swann. And to-night from a vantage point
 under the maples, when he had a car ready to follow, he had made
 sure he had seen them again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The red eye squared off at right angles to the highway, and
 disappeared. Lane came to a byroad, a lane lined with trees. He
 stopped his car and got out. It did not appear that he would have
 to walk far. And he was right, for presently a black object
 loomed against the gray obscurity. It was an automobile, without
 lights, in the shadow of trees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane halted. He carried a flash-light in his left hand, his gun
 in his right. For a moment he deliberated. This being abroad in
 the dark on an errand fraught with peril for some one had a
 familiar and deadly tang. He was at home in this atmosphere. Hell
 itself had yawned at his feet many and many a time. He was a
 different man here. He deliberated because it was wise to
 forestall events. He did not want to kill Swann then, unless in
 self-defense. He waited until that peculiarly quick and tight and
 cold settling of his nerves told of brain control over heart. Yet
 he was conscious of subdued hate, of a righteous and terrible
 wrath held in abeyance for the sake of his sister's name. And he
 regretted that he had imperiously demanded of himself this
 assurance of Lorna's wantonness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he stole forward, closer and closer. He heard a low voice of
 dalliance, a titter, high-pitched and sweet?sweet and wild.
 That was not Lorna's laugh. The car was not Swann's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane swerved to the left, and in the gloom of trees, passed by
 noiselessly. Soon he encountered another car?an open car
 with shields up?as silent as if empty. But the very silence
 of it was potent of life. It cried out to the night and to Lane.
 But it was not the car he had followed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again he slipped by, stealthily, yet scornful of his caution. Who
 cared? He might have shouted his mission to the heavens. Lane
 passed on. All he caught from the second car was a faint
 fragrance of smoke, wafted on the gentle summer breeze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Another black object loomed up?a larger car?the sedan
 Lane recognized. He did not bolt or hurry. His footsteps made no
 sound. Crouching a little he slipped round the car to one side.
 At the instant he reached for the handle of the door, a pang
 shook him. Alas, that he should be compelled to spy on Lorna! His
 little sister! He saw her as a curly-headed child, adoring him.
 Perhaps it might not be Lorna after all. But it was for her sake
 that he was doing this. The softer moment passed and the soldier
 intervened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With one swift turn and jerk he opened the door?then
 flashed his light. A scream rent the air. In the glaring circle
 of light Lane saw red hair?green eyes transfixed in
 fear?white shoulders?white arms?white ringed
 hands suddenly flung upward. Helen! The blood left his heart in a
 rush. Swann blinked in the light, bewildered and startled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swann, you'll have to excuse me," said Lane, coolly. "I thought
 you had my sister with you. I've spotted her twice with you in
 this car.... It may not interest you or your?your guest,
 but I'll add that you're damned lucky not to have Lorna here
 to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he snapped off his flash-light, and slamming the car door,
 he wheeled away.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane left his room and went into the shady woods, where he
 thought the July heat would be less unendurable, where the fever
 in his blood might abate. But though it was cool and pleasant
 there he experienced no relief. Wherever he went he carried the
 burden of his pangs. And his grim giant of unrest trod in his
 shadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He could not stay long in the woods. He betook himself to the
 hills and meadows. Action was beneficial for him, though he soon
 exhausted himself. He would have liked to fight out his battle
 that day. Should he go on spending his days and nights in a
 slowly increasing torment? The longer he fought the less chance
 he had of victory. Victory! There could be none. What victory
 could be won over a strange ineradicable susceptibility to the
 sweetness, charm, mystery of a woman? He plodded the fragrant
 fields with bent head, in despair. Loneliness hurt him as much as
 anything. And a new pang, the fiercest and most insupportable,
 had been added to his miseries. Jealousy! Thought of the father
 of Mel Iden's child haunted him, flayed him, made him feel
 himself ignoble and base. There was no help for that. And this
 fiend of jealousy added fuel to his love. Only long passionate
 iteration of his assurance of principle and generosity subdued
 that frenzy and at length gave him composure. Perhaps this had
 some semblance to victory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane returned to town weaker in one way than when he had left,
 yet stronger in another. Upon the outskirts of Middleville he
 crossed the river road and sat down upon a stone wall. The
 afternoon was far spent and the sun blazing red. Lane wiped his
 moist face and fanned himself with his hat. Behind him the shade
 of a wooded garden or park looked inviting. Back in the foliage
 he espied the vine-covered roof of an old summer house.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A fresh young voice burst upon his meditations. "Hello, Daren
 Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned in surprise to behold a girl in white, standing in
 the shade of trees beyond the wall. Somewhere he had seen that
 beautiful golden head, the dark blue, almost purple eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good afternoon. You startled me," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I called you twice."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed? I beg pardon. I didn't hear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't you remember me?" Her tone was one of pique and doubt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he remembered her. "Oh, of course. Bessy Bell! You must
 forgive me. I've been ill and upset lately. These bad spells of
 mine magnify time. It seems long since the Junior Prom."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you're ill," she returned, compassionately. "You do look
 pale and?won't you come in? It's dusty and hot there. Come.
 I'll take you where it's nice and cool."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you. I'll be glad to."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She led him to a green, fragrant nook, where a bench with
 cushions stood half-hidden under heavy foliage. Lane caught a
 glimpse of a winding flagged path, and in the distance a cottage
 among the trees.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, do you live here?" he asked. "It's pretty."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, this is my home. It's too damn far from town, I'll say. I'm
 buried alive," she replied, passionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bald speech struck Lane forcibly. All at once he remembered
 Bessy Bell and his former interest. She was a type of the
 heretofore inexplicable modern girl. Lane looked at her, seeing
 her suddenly with a clearer vision. Bessy Bell had a physical
 perfection, a loveliness that needed neither spirit nor
 animation. But life had given this girl so much more than beauty.
 A softness of light seemed to shine round her golden head; smiles
 played in secret behind her red lips ready to break forth, and
 there was a haunting hint of a dimple in her round cheek; on her
 lay the sweetness of youth subtly dawning into womanhood; the
 flashing eyes were keen with intellect, with fire, full of
 promise and mystic charm; and her beautiful, supple body, so
 plainly visible, seemed quivering with sheer, restless joy of
 movement and feeling. A trace of artificial color on her face and
 the indelicacy of her dress but slightly counteracted Lane's
 first impression.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You promised to call me up and make a date," she said, and sat
 down close to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I meant it too. But Bessy, I was ill, and then I forgot.
 You didn't miss much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog! Hear the man. Daren, I'd throw the whole bunch down to
 be with you," she exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the end of that speech she paled slightly and her breath came
 quickly. She looked bold, provocative, expectant, yet sincere.
 Child or woman, she had to be taken seriously. Here indeed was
 the mystery that had baffled Lane. He realized his opportunity,
 like a flash all his former thought and conjecture about this
 girl returned to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You would. Well, I'm highly flattered. Why, may I ask?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I've fallen for you," she replied, leaning close to him.
 "That's the main reason, I guess.... But another is, I want you
 to tell me all about yourself?in the war, you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd be glad to?if we get to be real friends," he said,
 thoughtfully. "I don't understand you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I'll say I don't just get you," she retorted. "What do you
 want? Have you forgotten the silver platter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She turned away with a restless quivering. She had shown no
 shyness. She was bold, intense, absolutely without fear; and
 however stimulating or attractive the situation evidently was, it
 was neither new nor novel to her. Some strange leaven worked deep
 in her. Lane could put no other interpretation on her words and
 actions than that she expected him to kiss her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy Bell, look at me," said Lane, earnestly. "You've said a
 mouthful, as the slang word goes. I'm sort of surprised, you
 remember. Bessy, you're not a girl whose head is full of
 excelsior. You've got brains. You can think.... Now, if you
 really like me?and I believe you?try to understand
 this. I've been away so long. All is changed. I don't know how to
 take girls. I'm ill?and unhappy. But if I could be your
 friend and could help you a little?please you?why
 it'd be good for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, they tell me you're going to die," she returned,
 breathlessly. Her glance was brooding, dark, pregnant with purple
 fire.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, don't believe all you hear. I'm not?not so far gone
 yet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They say you're game, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope so, Bessy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you make me think. You must believe me a pill. I wanted you
 to?to fall for me hard.... That bunch of sapheads have
 spoiled me, I'll say. Daren, I'm sick of them. All they want to
 do is mush. I like tennis, riding, golf. I want to do things. But
 it's too hot, or this, or that. Yet they'll break their necks to
 carry a girl off to some roadhouse, and dance?dance till
 you're melted. Then they stop along the river to go bathing. I've
 been twice. You see, I have to sneak away, or lie to mother and
 say I've gone to Gail's or somewhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bathing, at night?" queried Lane, curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure thing. It's spiffy, in the dark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course you took your bathing suits?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog! That would be telling."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane dropped his head and studied the dust at his feet. His heart
 beat thick and heavy. Through this girl the truth was going to be
 revealed to him. It seemed on the moment that he could not look
 into her eyes. She scattered his wits. He tried to erase from his
 mind every impression of her, so that he might begin anew to
 understand her. And the very first, succeeding this erasure, was
 a singular idea that she was the opposite of romantic.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, can you understand that it is hard for a soldier to talk
 of what has happened to him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say I can," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're sorry for me?" he went on, gently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sorry!... Give me a chance to prove what I am, Daren Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Very well, then. I will. We'll make a fifty-fifty bargain. Do
 you regard a promise sacred?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I think I do. Some of the girls quarrel with me because I get
 sore, and swear they're not square, as I try to be. I hate a liar
 and a quitter."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come then?shake hands on our bargain."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She seemed thrilled, excited. The clasp of her little hand showed
 force of character. She looked wonderingly up at him. Her appeal
 then was one of exquisite youth and beauty. Something of the
 baffling suggestion of an amorous expectation and response left
 her. This child would give what she received.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "First, then, it's for me to know a lot about you," went on Lane.
 "Will you tell me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. I'd trust you with anything," she replied, impulsively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long have you been going with boys?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, for two years, I guess. I had a passionate love affair when
 I was thirteen," she replied, with the nonchalance and
 sophistication of experience.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was impossible for Lane to take this latter remark for
 anything but the glib boldness of an erotic child. But he was not
 making any assurances to himself that he was right. Bessy Bell
 was fifteen years old, according to time. But she had the
 physical development of eighteen, and a mental range beyond his
 ken. The lawlessness unleashed by the war seemed embodied in this
 girl.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With an older boy?" queried Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. He was a kid of my own age. I guess I outgrew Ted," she
 replied, dreamily. "But he still tries to rush me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With whom do you go to the secret club-rooms?above White's
 ice cream parlor?" asked Lane, abruptly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy never flicked an eyelash. "Hot dog! So you're wise to that?
 I thought it was a secret. I told Rose Clymer those fellows
 weren't on the level. Who told you I was there? Your sister
 Lorna?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. No one told me. Never mind that. Who took you there? You
 needn't be afraid to trust <i>me</i>. I'm going to entrust my
 secrets to you by and bye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I went with Roy Vancey, the boy who was with me at Helen's the
 day I met you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, how often have you been to those club-rooms?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Three times."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Were you ever there alone without any girls?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I had my chance. Dick Swann tried his damnedest to get me to
 go. But I've no use for him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I just don't like him, Daren," she replied, evasively. "I love
 to have fun. But I haven't yet been so hard up I had to go out
 with some one I didn't like."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Has Swann had my sister Lorna at the club?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her replies had been prompt and frank. At this sudden query she
 seemed checked. Lane read in Bessy Bell then more of the truth of
 her than he had yet divined. Falsehood was naturally abhorrent to
 her. To lie to her parents or teachers savored of fun, and was
 part of the game. She did not want to lie to Lane, but in her
 code she could not betray another girl, especially to that girl's
 brother.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I promised I'd tell you all about myself," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I shouldn't have asked you to give away one of your friends," he
 returned. "Some other time I'll talk to you about Lorna. Tell you
 what I know, and ask you to help me save her??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Save</i> her! What do you mean, Daren?" she interrupted, with
 surprise.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, I've paid you the compliment of believing you have
 intelligence. Hasn't it occurred to you that Lorna?or other
 of her friends or yours?might be going straight to ruin?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ruin! No, that hadn't occurred to me. I heard Doctor Wallace
 make a crack like yours. Mother hauled me to church the Sunday
 after you broke up Fanchon Smith's dance. Doctor Wallace didn't
 impress me. These old people make me sick anyhow. They don't
 understand.... But Daren, I think I get your drift. So snow some
 more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All in a moment, it seemed to Lane, this girl passed from
 surprise to gravity, then to contempt, and finally to humor. She
 was fascinating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To go back to the club," resumed Lane. "Bessy, what did you do
 there?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, we toddled and shimmied. Cut up! Had an immense time, I'll
 say."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you mean by cut up?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, we just ran wild, you know. Fool stunts!... Once Roy was
 sore because I kicked cigarettes out of Bob's mouth. But the boob
 was tickled stiff when I kicked for <i>him</i>. Jealous! It's all
 right with any one of the boys what you do for <i>him</i>. But if
 you do the same for <i>another</i> boy?good night!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy had no divination of the fact that her words for Lane had a
 clarifying significance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I suppose you played what we used to call kissing games?"
 queried Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A sweet, high trill of laughter escaped Bessy's red lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you are funny. Those games are as dead as Caesar.... This
 bunch of boys and girls paired off by themselves to spoon.... As
 for myself, I don't mind spooning if I like the fellow?and
 he hasn't been drinking. But otherwise I hate it. All the same I
 got what was coming to me from some of the boys of the Strong Arm
 Club."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why do they give it that name?" asked Lane, remembering Colonel
 Pepper's remarks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, if a girl doesn't come across she gets the strong arm.... I
 had to fight like the devil that last afternoon I went there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Did</i> you fight, Bessy?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll say I did.... Roy Vancey is sore as a pup. He hasn't been
 near me or called me up since."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, will you promise to stay away from that place?and
 not to go joy-riding with any of those boys?day or
 night?if I meet you, and tell you all about my experience
 in the war? I'll do my best to keep the time you spend with me
 from being tedious."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's another bargain," she returned deliberately, "if you just
 don't spend enough time with me to make me stuck on
 you?then throw me down. On the level, now, Daren?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll meet you as often as you want. And I'll be your friend as
 long as you prove to me I can be of any help, or pleasure, or
 good to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hot dog, but you're taking some job, Daren. Won't it be just
 spiffy? We'll meet here, afternoons, and evenings when mother's
 out. She's nutty on bridge. She makes me promise I won't leave
 the yard. So I'll not have to lie to meet you.... Daren, that day
 at Helen's, the minute I saw you I knew you were going to have
 something to do with my future."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, a little while ago I made sure you had no romance in
 you," replied Lane, with a smile. "Now as we've gotten serious,
 let's think hard about the future. What do you want most? Do you
 care for study, for books? Have you any gift for music? Do you
 ever think of fitting yourself for useful work?... Or is your
 mind full of this jazz stuff? Do you just want to go from day to
 day, like a butterfly from flower to flower? Just this boy and
 that one?not caring much which?all this frivolity you
 hinted of, and worse, living this precious time of your youth all
 for excitement? What is it you want most?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She responded with a thoughtfulness that inspired Lane's hope for
 her. This girl could be reached. She was like Lorna in many ways,
 but different in mentality. Bessy watched the gyrations of her
 shapely little foot. She could not keep still even in
 abstraction.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A girl <i>must</i> have a good time," she replied presently.
 "I've done things I hated because I couldn't bear to be left out
 of the fun.... But I like most to read and dream. Music makes me
 strange inside, and to want to do great things. Only there
 <i>are</i> no great things to do. I've never been nutty about a
 career, like Helen is. And I always hated work.... I
 guess?to tell on the level?what I want most is to be
 loved."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that she raised her eyes to Lane's. He tried to read her
 mind, and realized that if he failed it was not because she was
 not baring it. Dropping his own gaze, he pondered. The girl's
 response to his earnestness was intensely thought-provoking. No
 matter how immodestly she was dressed, or what she had confessed
 to, or whether she had really expected and desired dalliance on
 his part?here was the truth as to her hidden yearning. The
 seething and terrible Renaissance of the modern girl seemed
 remarkably exemplified in Bessy Bell, yet underneath it all hid
 the fundamental instinct of all women of all ages. Bessy wanted
 most to be loved. Was that the secret of her departure from the
 old-fashioned canons of modesty and reserve?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy," went on Lane, presently. "I've heard my sister speak of
 Rose Clymer. Is she a friend of yours, too?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You bet. And she's the square kid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lorna told me she'd been expelled from school."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. She refused to tattle."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tattle what?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wrote some verses which one of the girls copied. Miss Hill
 found them and raised the roof. She kept us all in after school.
 She let some of the girls off. But she expelled Rose and sent me
 home. Then she called on mama. I don't know what she said, but
 mama didn't let me go back. I've had a hateful old tutor for a
 month. In the fall I'm going to private school."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And Rose?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose went to work. She had a hard time. I never heard from her
 for weeks. But she's a telephone operator at the Exchange now.
 She called me up one day lately and told me. I hope to see her
 soon."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "About those verses, Bessy. How did Miss Hill find out who wrote
 them?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told her. Then she sent me home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Have you any more verses you wrote?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, a lot of them. If you lend me your pencil, I'll write out
 the verse that gave Miss Hill heart disease."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy took up a book that had been lying on the seat, and tearing
 out the fly-leaf, she began to write. Her slim, shapely hand
 flew. It fascinated Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There!" she said, ending with a flourish and a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Lane, foreshadowing the import of the verse, took the page
 with reluctance. Then he read it. Verses of this significance
 were new to him. Relief came to Lane in the divination that Bessy
 could not have had experience of what she had written. There was
 worldliness in the verse, but innocence in her eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Bessy, my heart isn't much stronger than Miss Hill's," he
 said, finally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her merry laughter rang out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, what will you do for me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bring me every scrap of verse you have, every note you've got
 from boys and girls."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Shall I get them now?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, if it's safe. Of course, you've hidden them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mama's out. I won't be a minute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Away she flew under the trees, out through the rose bushes, a
 white, graceful, flitting figure. She vanished. Presently she
 came bounding into sight again and handed Lane a bundle of notes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did you keep back any?" he asked, as he tried to find pockets
 enough for the collection.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll go home and read them all. Then I'll meet you here to-night
 at eight o'clock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But?I've a date. I'll break it, though."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "With whom?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Gail and a couple of boys?kids."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Does your mother know?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd tell her about Gail, but that's all. We go for ice
 cream?then meet the boys and take a walk."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, you're not going to do that sort of thing any more."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane bent over her, took her hands. She instinctively rebelled,
 then slowly yielded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's part of our bargain?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, it certainly is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then I won't ever again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, I trust you. Do you understand me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?I think so."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, will you care for me?if I'm?if I do as you
 want me to?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do now," he replied. "And I'll care a thousand times more when
 you prove you're really above these things.... Bessy, I'll care
 for you as a friend?as a brother?as a man who has
 almost lost his faith and who sees in you some hope to keep his
 spirit alive. I'm unhappy, Bessy. Perhaps you can help
 me?make me a little happier.... Anyway, I trust you.
 Good-bye now. To-night, at eight o'clock."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went home to his room and earnestly gave himself up to the
 perusal of the writings Bessy Bell had given him. He experienced
 shocks of pain and wonder, between which he had to laugh. All the
 fiendish wit of youthful ingenuity flashed forth from this verse.
 There was a parody on Tennyson's "Break, Break, Break," featuring
 Colonel Pepper's famous and deplorable habit. Miss Hill came in
 for a great share of opprobrium. One verse, if it had ever come
 under the eyes of the good schoolteacher, would have broken her
 heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane read all Bessy's verses, and then the packet of notes
 written by Bessy's girl friends. The truth was unbelievable. Yet
 here were the proofs. Over Bessy and her friends Lane saw the dim
 dark shape of a ghastly phantom, reaching out, enfolding,
 clutching. He went downstairs to the kitchen and here he burned
 the writings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It ought to be told," he muttered. "But who's going to tell it?
 Who'd believe me? The truth would not be comprehended by the
 mothers of Middleville.... And who's to blame?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It would not do, Lane reflected, to place the blame wholly upon
 blind fathers and mothers, though indeed they were culpable. And
 in consideration of the subject, Lane excluded all except the
 better class of Middleville. It was no difficult task to
 understand lack of moral sense in children who were poor and
 unfortunate, who had to work, and get what pleasures they had in
 the streets. But how about the best families, where there were
 luxurious homes, books, education, amusement, kindness,
 love?all the supposed stimuli needed for the proper
 guidance of changeful vagrant minds? These good influences had
 failed. There was a greater moral abandonment than would ever be
 known.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Before the war Bessy Bell would have presented the perfect type
 of the beautiful, highly sensitive, delicately organized girl so
 peculiarly and distinctively American. She would have ripened
 before her time. Perhaps she would not have been greatly
 different in feeling from the old-fashioned girl: only different
 in that she had restraint, no deceit.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But after the war?now?what was Bessy Bell? What
 actuated her? What was the secret spring of her abnormal
 tendencies? Were they abnormal? Bessy was wild to abandon herself
 to she knew not what. Some glint of intelligence, some force of
 character as exceptional in her as it was wanting in Lorna, some
 heritage of innate sacredness of person, had kept Bessy from the
 abyss. She had absorbed in mind all the impurities of the day,
 but had miraculously escaped them in body. If her parents could
 have known Bessy as Lane now realized her they would have been
 horrified. But Lane's horror was fading. Bessy was illuminating
 the darkness of his mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 To understand more clearly what the war had done to Bessy Bell,
 and to the millions of American girls like her, it was necessary
 for Lane to understand what the war had done to soldiers, to men,
 and to the world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could grasp some infinitesimal truth of the sublime and
 horrible change war had wrought in the souls of soldiers. That
 change was too great for any mind but the omniscient to grasp in
 its entirety. War had killed in some soldiers a belief in Christ:
 in others it had created one. War had unleashed the old hidden
 primitive instincts of manhood: likewise it had fired hearts to
 hate of hate and love of love, to the supreme ideal consciousness
 could conceive. War had brought out the monstrous in men and as
 well the godlike. Some soldiers had become cowards; others,
 heroes. There were thousands of soldiers who became lions to
 fight, hyenas to snarl, beasts to debase, hogs to wallow. There
 were equally as many who were forced to fight, who could not
 kill, whose gentleness augmented under the brutal orders of their
 officers. There were those who ran toward the front, heads up,
 singing at the top of their lungs. There were those who slunk
 back. Soldiers became cold, hard, materialistic, bitter,
 rancorous: and qualities antithetic to these developed in their
 comrades.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane exhausted his resources of memory and searched in his notes
 for a clipping he had torn from a magazine. He reread it, in the
 light of his crystallizing knowledge:
 </p><br>
 <div class="blockquot">
 <p>
 "Had I not been afraid of the scorn of my brother officers and
 the scoffs of my men, I would have fled to the rear," confesses
 a Wisconsin officer, writing of a battle.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I see war as a horrible, grasping octopus with hundreds of
 poisonous, death-dealing tentacle that squeeze out the culture
 and refinement of a man," writes a veteran.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A regimental sergeant-major: "I considered myself hardboiled,
 and acted the part with everybody, including my wife. I scoffed
 at religion as unworthy of a real man and a mark of the sissy
 and weakling." Before going over the top for the first time he
 tried to pray, but had even forgotten the Lord's Prayer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I get out of this, I will never be unhappy again,"
 reflected one of the contestants under shell-fire in the
 Argonne Forest. To-day he is "not afraid of dead men any more
 and is not in the least afraid to die."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I went into the army a conscientious objector, a radical, and
 a recluse.... I came out of it with the knowledge of men and
 the philosophy of beauty," says another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My moral fiber has been coarsened. The war has blunted my
 sensitiveness to human suffering. In 1914 I wept tears of
 distress over a rabbit which I had shot. I could go out now at
 the command of my government in cold-blooded fashion and commit
 all the barbarisms of twentieth-century legalized murder,"
 writes a Chicago man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A Denver man entered the war, lost himself and God, and found
 manhood. "I played poker in the box-car which carried me to the
 front and read the Testament in the hospital train which took
 me to the rear," he tells us.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To disclose it all would take the genius and the understanding
 of a god. I learned to talk from the side of my mouth and drink
 and curse with the rest of our 'noble crusaders.' Authority
 infuriated me and the first suspicion of an order made me
 sullen and dangerous.... Each man in his crudeness and lewdness
 nauseated me," writes a service man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When our boy came back," complains a mother, "we could hardly
 recognize for our strong, impulsive, loving son whom we had
 loaned to Uncle Sam this irritable, restless, nervous man with
 defective hearing from shells exploding all about him, and
 limbs aching and twitching from strain and exposure, and with
 that inevitable companion of all returned oversea boys, the
 coffin-nail, between his teeth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "In the army I found that hard drinkers and fast livers and
 profane-tongued men often proved to be the kindest-hearted,
 squarest friends one could ever have," one mother reports.
 </p><br>
 </div>
 <p>
 So then the war brought to the souls of soldiers an extremity of
 debasement and uplift, a transformation incomprehensible to the
 mind of man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Upon men outside the service the war pressed its materialism. The
 spiritual progress of a thousand years seemed in a day to have
 been destroyed. Self-preservation was the first law of nature.
 And all the standards of life were abased. Following the terrible
 fever of patriotism and sacrifice and fear came the inevitable
 selfishness and greed and frenzy. The primitive in man stalked
 forth. The world became a place of strife.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What then, reflected Lane, could have been the effect of war upon
 women? The mothers of the race, of men! The creatures whom
 emotions governed! The beings who had the sex of tigresses! "The
 female of the species!" What had the war done to the generation
 of its period?to Helen, to Mel Iden, to Lorna, to Bessy
 Bell? Had it made them what men wanted?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At eight o'clock that night Lane kept his tryst with Bessy. The
 serene, mellow light of the moon shone down upon the garden. The
 shade appeared spotted with patches of moonlight; the summer
 breeze rustled the leaves; the insects murmured their night song.
 Romance and beauty still lived. No war could kill them. Bessy
 came gliding under the trees, white and graceful like a nymph,
 fearless, full of her dream, ripe to be made what a man would
 make of her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane talked to Bessy of the war. Words came like magic to his
 lips. He told her of the thunder and fire and blood and heroism,
 of fight and agony and death. He told her of himself?of his
 service in the hours that tried his soul. Bessy passed from
 fascinated intensity to rapture and terror. She clung to Lane.
 She kissed him. She wept.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He told her how his ideal had been to fight for Helen, for Lorna,
 for her, and all American girls. And then he talked about what he
 had come home to?of the shock?the
 realization?the disappointment and grief. He spoke of his
 sister Lorna?how he had tried so hard to make her see, and
 had failed. He importuned Bessy to help him as only a girl could.
 And lastly, he brought the conversation back to her and told her
 bluntly what he thought of the vile verses, how she dragged her
 girlhood pride in the filth and made of herself a byword for
 vicious boys. He told her the truth of what real men thought and
 felt of women. Every man had a mother. No war, no unrest, no
 style, no fad, no let-down of morals could change the truth. From
 the dark ages women had climbed on the slow realization of
 freedom, honor, chastity. As the future of nations depended upon
 women, so did their salvation. Women could never again be
 barbarians. All this modern license was a parody of love. It must
 inevitably end in the degradation and unhappiness of those of the
 generation who persisted on that downward path. Hard indeed it
 would be to encounter the ridicule of girls and the indifference
 of boys. But only through the intelligence and courage of one
 could there ever be any hope for the many.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane sat there under the moonlit maples and talked until he was
 hoarse. He could not rouse a sense of shame in Bessy, because
 that had been atrophied, but as he closely watched her, he
 realized that his victory would come through the emotion he was
 able to arouse in her, and the ultimate appeal to the clear logic
 of her mind.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When the time came for him to go she stood before him in the
 clear moonlight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've never been so excited, so scared and sick, so miserable and
 thoughtful in all my life before," she said. "Daren, I know now
 what a soldier is. What you've seen?what you've done. Oh!
 it was grand! ... And you're going to be my?my friend....
 Daren, I thought it was great to be bad. I thought men liked a
 girl to be bad. The girls nicknamed me Angel Bell, but not
 because I was an angel, I'll tell the world.... Now I'm going to
 try to be the girl you want me to be."
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIV
 </h2>
 <p>
 The time came when Daren had to make a painful choice. His sister
 Lorna grew weary of his importunities and distrustful of his
 espionage. One night she became violent and flatly told him she
 would not stay in the house another day with him in it. Then she
 ran out, slamming the door behind her. Lane remained awake all
 night, in the hope that she would return. But she did not. And
 then he knew he must make a choice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He made it. Lorna must not be driven from her home. Lane divided
 his money with his mother and packed his few effects. Mrs. Lane
 was distracted over the situation. She tried to convince Lane
 there was some kind of a law to keep a young girl home. She
 pleaded and begged him to remain. She dwelt on his ill health.
 But Lane was obdurate; and not the least of his hurts was the
 last one?a divination that in spite of his mother's
 distress there was a feeling of relief of which she was
 unconscious. He assured her that he would come to see her often
 during the afternoons and would care as best he could for his
 health. Then he left, saying he would send an expressman for the
 things he had packed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Broodingly Lane plodded down the street. He had feared that
 sooner or later he would be forced to leave home, and he had
 shrunk from the ordeal. But now, that it was over, he felt a kind
 of relief, and told himself that it was of no consequence what
 happened to him. All that mattered was for him to achieve the few
 tasks he had set himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he thought of Mel Iden. She had been driven from home and
 would know what it meant to him. The longing to see her
 increased. Every disappointment left him more in need of
 sympathy. And now, it seemed, he would be ashamed to go to Mel
 Iden or Blair Maynard. Such news could not long be kept from
 them. Middleville was a beehive of gossips. Lane had a moment of
 blank despair, a feeling of utter, sick, dazed wonder at life and
 human nature. Then he lifted his head and went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane's first impulse was to ask Colonel Pepper if he could share
 his lodgings, but upon reflection he decided otherwise. He
 engaged a small room in a boarding house; his meals, which did
 not seem of much importance, he could get anywhere.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This change of residence brought Lane downtown, and naturally
 increased his activities. He did not husband his strength as
 before, nor have the leisure for bad spells. Home had been a
 place of rest. He could not rest in a drab little bare room he
 now occupied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He became a watcher, except during the stolen hours with Bessy
 Bell. Then he tried to be a teacher. But he learned more than he
 thought. He no longer concentrated his vigilance on his sister.
 Having failed to force that issue, he bided his time, sensing
 with melancholy portent the certainty that he would soon be
 confronted with the stark and hateful actuality. Thus he wore
 somewhat away from his grim resolve to kill Swann. That adventure
 on the country road, when he had discovered Swann with Helen
 instead of Lorna, had somehow been a boon. Nevertheless he spied
 upon Lorna in the summer evenings when it was possible to follow
 her, and he dogged Swann's winding and devious path as far as
 possible. Apparently Swann had checked his irregularities as far
 as Lorna was concerned. Still Lane trusted nothing. He became an
 almost impassive destiny with the iron consequences in his hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Days passed. Every other afternoon and night he spent hours with
 Bessy Bell, and found a mounting happiness in the change in her,
 a deep and ever deeper insight into the causes that had developed
 her. The balance of his waking hours, which were many, he passed
 on the streets, in the ice cream parlors and confectionery dens,
 at the motion-picture theatres. He went many and odd times to
 Colonel Pepper's apartment, and took a peep into the club-rooms.
 Some of these visits were fruitful, but he did not see whom he
 expected to see there. At night he haunted the parks, watching
 and listening. Often he hired a cheap car and drove it down the
 river highway, where he would note the cars he passed or met.
 Sometimes he would stop to get out and make one of his scouting
 detours, or he would follow a car to some distant roadhouse, or
 go to the outlying summer pavilions where popular dances were
 given. More than once, late at night, he was an unseen and
 unbidden guest at one of the gay bathing parties. Strange and
 startling incidents seemed to gravitate toward Lane. He might
 have been predestined for this accumulation of facts. How vain it
 seethed for wild young men and women to think they hid their
 tracks! Some trails could not be hidden.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Toward the end of that protracted period of surveillance, Lane
 knew that he had become infamous in the eyes of most of that
 younger set. He had been seen too often, alone, watching, with no
 apparent excuse for his presence. And from here and there,
 through Bessy and Colonel Pepper, and Blair, who faithfully
 hunted him up, Lane learned of the unfavorable light in which he
 was held. Society, in the persons of the younger matrons, took
 exception to Lane's queer conduct and hinted of mental unbalance.
 The young rakes and libertines avoided him, and there was not a
 slacker among them who could meet his eye across cafe or billiard
 room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Yet despite the peculiar species of ignominy and disgrace that
 Middleville gossips heaped upon Lane's head and the slow, steady
 decline of his speaking acquaintance with the elite, there were
 some who always greeted him and spoke if he gave them a chance.
 Helen Wrapp never failed of a green flashing glance of mockery
 and enticement. She smiled, she beckoned, she once called him to
 her car and asked him to ride with her, to come to see her.
 Margaret Maynard rose above dread of her mother and greeted Lane
 graciously when occasion offered. Dorothy Dalrymple and Elinor
 always evinced such unhesitating intention of friendship that
 Lane grew to avoid meeting them. And twice, when he had come face
 to face with Mel Iden, her look, her smile had been such that he
 had plunged away somewhere, throbbing and thrilling, to grow
 blind and sick and numb. It was the failure of his hopes, and the
 suffering he endured, and the vain longings she inspired that
 heightened his love. She wrote him after the last time they had
 passed on the street?a note that stormed Lane's heart. He
 did not answer. He divined that his increasing loneliness, and
 the sure slow decline of his health, and the heartless
 intolerance of the same class that had ostracized her were added
 burdens to Mel Iden's faithful heart. He had seen it in her face,
 read it in her note. And the time would come, sooner or later,
 when he could go to her and make her marry him.

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XV
 </h2>
 <p>
 To be a mystery is overpoweringly sweet to any girl and Bessy
 Bell was being that. Her sudden desire for solitude had worried
 her mother, and her distant superiority had incited the vexation
 of her friends. When they exerted themselves to win Bessy back to
 her old self she looked dreamily beyond them and became more
 aloof. Doctor Bronson, in reply to Mrs. Bell's appeal to him,
 looked the young woman over, asked her a few questions, marveled
 at the imperious artifice with which she evaded him, and throwing
 up his hands said Bessy was beyond him. The dark fever, rising
 from the school yards and the playgrounds and the streets, subtly
 poisoning the blood of Bessy Bell, slowly lost its heat and power
 for the time being. Bessy lived in the full secret expression of
 her girlish adoration. She was worshipping a hero; she was
 glorifying in her sacrifice; she was faithful to a man; she was
 being a woman. At first she grew pale, tense, quiet, and seemed
 to be going into a decline. Then that stage passed; and the
 roseleaf flush returned to her cheeks, the purple fire deepened
 in her eyes, the quivering life in all her supple young body.
 Night after night loneliness had no fears for her. If she heard a
 whistle on the avenue, the honk of a car?the familiar old
 signals of the boys and girls, she smiled her disdain, and
 curling comfortably in her great chair, bent her lovely head over
 her books.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the beginning her dreams were all of Daren Lane, of the
 strangeness and glory of this soldier who spent so many secret
 hours with her. And when the time came that she did not see him
 so often her dreams were just as full. But gradually, as the days
 went by, other figures than Lane's were limned upon her
 fancy?vague figures of heroes, knights, soldiers. He still
 dominated her romances, though less personally. She built around
 him. Every day brought her new strange desires.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One evening in August when Bessy sat alone the telephone bell
 rang sharply. She ran to take down the receiver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, hello, that you, Bessy?" came the hurried call in a
 girl's voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose! Oh, how are you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine. But say, Angel, I can't take time to talk. Something
 doing. Are you alone?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, all alone, old girl."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Listen, then, and get this.... I'm here, you know, telephone
 girl at the Exchange. Just heard your father on the wire. Some
 one has betrayed the secret of the club. There's a warrant out
 for the arrest of the boys. For gambling. You know there's a
 political vice drive on. Some time to-night they'll be raided....
 But early. Bess, are you getting this?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. Hurry?hurry," replied Bessy, in excitement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I tried to get Dick on the wire, but couldn't. Same with two
 more of the boys. But I did get wise to this. Gail and Lorna have
 a date at the club to-night.... Never mind how I found out. Dick
 has thrown me down for Gail. I'm sore as a pup. But I don't want
 your father to pinch those girls.... Now, Bess, I'm tied here.
 But you get a move on. Don't waste time. You can save them. You
 must. Do something. If you can't find somebody, go straight to
 the club. You know where the key for the outside entrance is
 kept. Hurry and it'll be safe. Good-bye."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy stood statue-like for a moment, her big eyes glowing,
 changing, darkening with rapid thought, then she flew upstairs to
 her room, snatched a veil and a soft hat, and putting these on as
 she went, she flew out of the house without putting out the
 lights or locking the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a dark windy night, slightly cool for August, and a fine
 misty rain was blowing. Bessy's footsteps pattered softly as she
 ran block after block, and she did not slacken her pace till she
 reached the house where Daren Lane had his room. In answer to her
 ring a woman appeared, who told her Mr. Lane was out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This was a severe disappointment to Bessy, and left her an
 alternative that required more than courage, but she did not
 vacillate. She sped swiftly on in the dark, for the electric
 lights were few and far between, until the black of the gloomy
 building, where the boys had their club, loomed up. On the corner
 Bessy saw a man standing with his back to a telegraph pole. This
 occasioned her much concern; perhaps he might be watching the
 building. But he had not seen her, of that she was certain. The
 possibility that he might be a spy made her task all the harder.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy returned the way she come, crossed at the next corner,
 hurried round the block and up to the outside stairway that was
 her objective point.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By feeling along the brick wall she brought up, with a sudden
 bump, at the back of the stairway. Then she deliberated. If she
 went around to the front so as to get access to the steps, she
 might pass in range of the loiterer whom she mistrusted. That
 risk she would not incur. Examining the wall that enclosed the
 box-like stairway as best she could in the dark, she found it
 rickety, full of holes and cracks, and she decided she would
 climb it. A sheer perpendicular board wall, some twelve or
 fifteen feet high, shrouded in pitchy darkness and apparently
 within earshot of a police spy, did not daunt Bessy Bell.
 Slipping her strong fingers in crevices and her slim toes in
 cracks, she climbed up and up, till she got hold of the railing
 post on the first platform. Here she had great difficulty to keep
 from falling, but lifting and squirming her supple body, by a
 desperate effort she got her knees on the platform, and then
 pulled herself to safety. Once on the stairs she ran up the
 remaining few steps to the landing, where she rested panting and
 triumphant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As she was about to go on she heard footsteps, which froze her. A
 man was crossing the street. He came from the direction of the
 corner where she had seen the supposed spy. Presently she saw him
 stop under one of the trees to scratch a match, and in the round
 glow of light she saw him puff at a cigar. Then he passed on with
 uncertain steps, as of one slightly under the influence of drink.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy's heart warmed to life and began to beat again. Then she
 sought for the key. She had been told where it was, but did not
 remember. Slipping her hand under the railing, close to the wall,
 she felt a string, and, pulling at it suddenly, found the key in
 her hand. She glided into the dim hall, feeling along the wall
 for a door, until she found it. With trembling fingers she
 inserted the key in the lock, and the door swung inward silently.
 Bessy went in, leaving the key on the outside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dark as it had been without, it was light compared to the ebon
 blackness within. Bessy felt ice form in the marrow of her bones.
 The darkness was tangible; it seemed to envelop her in heavy
 folds. The sudden natural impulse to fly out of the thick
 creeping gloom, down the stairway to the light, strung her
 muscles for instant action, but checked by the swiftly following
 thought of her purpose, they relaxed, and she took not a backward
 step.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose did her part and I'll do mine," she cogitated. "I've got to
 save them. But what to do?I may have to wait. I
 know?in the big room?the closet behind the curtain! I
 can find that even in this dark, and once in there I won't be
 afraid."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bessy, fired by this inspiration, groped along the wall through
 the room to the large chamber, stumbled over chairs and a couch
 and at last got her hands on the drapery. She readily found the
 knob, turned it, opened the door and stepped in.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I hope they won't be long," she thought. "I hope the girls come
 first. I don't want to burst into a room full of boys. Won't
 Daren be surprised when I tell him?maybe angry! But it's
 bound to come out all right, and father will never know."
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Early one August evening Lane went out to find a cool misty rain
 blowing down from the hills. At the inn he encountered Colonel
 Pepper, who wore a most woebegone and ludicrous expression. He
 pounced at once upon Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, what do you think?" he wailed, miserably.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I don't think. I know. You've gone and done it?pulled that
 stunt of yours again," returned Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?but oh, so much worse this time."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Worse! How could it be worse, unless you mean some one punched
 your head."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. That would have been nothing.... Daren, this?this time
 I?it was a lady!" gasped Pepper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, say now, Pepper?not really?" queried Lane,
 incredulously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It was. And a lady I?I admire very much."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Amanda Hill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The schoolteacher? Nice little woman like that! Pepper, why
 couldn't you pick on one of these Middleville gossips or society
 dames?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lord?I didn't know who she was?until after?and
 I couldn't have helped it anyway," he replied, mopping his red
 face. "When?I saw her?and she recognized me?I
 nearly died.... It was at White's Confectionery Den. And I'm
 afraid some people saw me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well. You old duffer! And you say you admire this lady very
 much?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Indeed I do. I call on her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Colonel, your name is Dennis," replied Lane, with merciless
 humor. "It serves you right."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little man evidently found relief in his confession and in
 Lane's censure.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm cured forever," he declared vehemently. "And say, Lane, I've
 been looking for you. Have you been at my rooms lately?you
 know?to take a peep?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have not," replied Lane, turning sharply. A slight chill went
 over him. "I thought that club stuff was off."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Off?nothing," whispered Colonel Pepper, drawing Lane
 aside. "Swann and his strong-arm gang just got foxy. They quit
 for a while. Now they're rushing the girls in there?say
 from four to five?and in the evenings a little while, not
 too late. Oh, they're the slick bunch, picking out the ice cream
 soda hour when everybody's downtown.... You run up to my rooms
 right now. And I'll gamble??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll go," interrupted Lane, grimly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Not fifteen minutes before he had seen his sister Lorna and a
 chum, Gail Williams, go into White's place. Lane's pulse
 quickened. As he started to go he ran into Blair Maynard who
 grasped at him: "What's hurry, old scout?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair, I'm never in a hurry if you want me. But the fact is I've
 got rather urgent business. How about to-morrow?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. Meet you here. I just wanted to unload on you, Dare. Looks
 as if my mother has hatched it up between Margie and our esteemed
 countryman, Richard Swann."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not often that Lane cursed, but he did so now.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But Blair, didn't you <i>tell</i> your mother what this fellow
 is?" remonstrated Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll say I did," replied Blair, sardonically. "Cut no ice
 whatever. She didn't believe. She didn't care for any proofs. All
 rich young men had their irregularities!... Good God! Doesn't it
 make you sick?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But how about Holt Dalrymple?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Holt's turned over a new leaf. He's working hard, and I think he
 has taken a tumble to himself. Listen to this. He met Margie with
 Dick Swann out at one of the lake dances?Watkins' Lake. And
 he cut her dead. I'm sorry for Margie. She sure is rank poison
 these days.... Well, speak of the devil!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holt Dalrymple collided with them at the entrance of the inn. The
 haggard, sullen, heated look that had characterized him was gone.
 He was sunburned, and his dark eyes were bright. He greeted his
 friends warmly. They chatted for a moment. Then Lane grew
 thoughtful, all the while gazing at Holt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What's the idea?" queried that worthy, presently. "Anything
 wrong with me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy, you're just great. Seeing you has done me good.... You ask
 what's the idea. Holt, would you do me a favor?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would I? Listen to the guy," returned young Dalrymple. "Daren,
 I'd do any old thing for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you happen to know Bessy Bell?" went on Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dalrymple quickened with surprise. "Yes, I know her. Some little
 peach!... I almost ran into her down on West Street a few minutes
 ago. She wore a white veil. She didn't see me, or recognize me.
 But I sure knew her. She was almost running. I bet a million to
 myself she had a date at the club."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You lose, Holt," replied Lane, shortly. "Bessy Bell is one
 Middleville kid who has come clean through this mess."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say Dare, I like to hear you talk," responded Blair, half in
 jest and half in earnest. "But aren't you getting a trifle
 unbalanced? That's how my mother apologizes for me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Cut the joshing, boys. Listen," returned Lane. "And don't ever
 tell this to a soul. I interested myself in Bessy Bell. I've met
 her more times than I can count. I wanted to see if it was
 possible to turn one of these girls around. I failed on my sister
 Lorna. But Bessy Bell is true blue. She had all this modern
 tommyrot. She had everything else too. Brains, sweetness, common
 sense, romance. All I tried to do was to make her forget the
 tommyrot. And I think I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be darned!" ejaculated Blair. "Dare, that was ripping
 fine of you.... What'll you do next, I wonder."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come on with your favor," added Holt, with a keen bright smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Would you be willing to see Bessy occasionally?and sort of
 be nice to her?you know?" asked Lane, earnestly. "I can't
 keep up my attention to her much longer. She might miss me. Take
 it from me, Holt, back of all this modern stuff?deep in
 Bessy, and in every girl who has not been debased?is the
 simple and good desire to be liked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I'll do that little thing, believe me," returned Holt,
 warmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shaking hands with his friends, Lane left them, and went on his
 way. White's place was full as a beehive. As he passed, Lane
 found himself looking for Bessy Bell's golden head, though he
 knew he would not see it. He wondered if Holt had really met her,
 veiled and in a hurry. That had a strange look. But no shadow of
 distrust of Bessy came to Lane. In a few moments he reached the
 dark stairway leading to Colonel Pepper's apartment. Lane forgot
 he was weak. But at the top, with his breast laboring, he
 remembered well enough. He went into the Colonel's rooms and
 through them without making a light. And when he reached the
 place where he had spied upon the club he was wet with sweat and
 shaking with excitement. Carefully, so as not to make noise, he
 stole to the peep-hole and applied his eye.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw a gleam of light on shiny waxed floor, and then, moving to
 get the limit of his narrow vision, he descried Swann, evidently
 just arrived. With him was Gail Williams, a slip of a child not
 over fifteen?looking up at him as if excited and pleased.
 Next Lane espied his sister Lorna with a tall, well-built man.
 Although his back was toward Lane, he could not mistake the
 soldierly bearing of Captain Vane Thesel! Lorna looked perturbed
 and sulky, and once, turning her face toward Swann, she seemed
 resentful. Captain Thesel had his hand at her elbow and appeared
 to be talking earnestly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane left his post, taking care to make no noise. But once back
 in the Colonel's rooms, he hurried. Feeling in the dark corner
 where he had kept the axe ready for just such an emergency as
 this, he grasped it and rushed out. Tiptoeing down the hall, he
 found the narrow door, stole down the black stairway and entered
 the main hall. Here he paused, suddenly checked in his hurry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This won't do," he thought, and shook his head. "Much as I'd
 like to kill those two dogs I can't?I can't.... I'll smash
 their faces, though?and if I ever catch...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Breaking the thought off abruptly, he passed down the dim hallway
 to the door of the club-rooms. He raised the axe and was about to
 smash the lock when he espied a key in the keyhole. The door was
 not locked. Lane set down the axe and noiselessly turned the knob
 and peeped in. The first room was dark, but the door on the
 opposite side was ajar, and through it Lane saw the larger
 lighted room and the shiny floor. Moving figures crossed the
 space. Removing the key, Lane slipped inside the room and locked
 the door. Then he tip-toed to the opposite door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thesel and Lorna were now so close that Lane could hear them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But I thought I had a date with Dick," protested Lorna. Her face
 was red and she stamped her foot.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See here, kiddo. If you're as thick as that I'll have to put you
 wise," answered Thesel, good-humoredly, as he tilted back his
 cigarette to blow smoke at the ceiling. "Dick is through with
 you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, <i>is</i> he?" choked Lorna.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, Cap, I heard a noise," suddenly called out Swann, rather
 nervously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a moment's silence. Lane, too, had heard a noise, but
 could not be sure whether it was inside the building or not.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann hurried over to join Thesel. They looked blankly at each
 other. The air might have been charged. Both girls showed alarm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Lane, with his hand on the gun in his pocket, strode out to
 confront them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?h!" gasped Lorna, as if appalled at sight of her
 brother's face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fellows, I'll have to break up your little party," said Lane,
 coolly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Thesel turned ghastly white, while Swann grew livid with rage. He
 seemed to expand. His hand went back to his right hip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Lane got within six feet of them, Swann drew a small
 automatic pistol. But before he could raise it, Lane had leaped
 into startling activity. With terrific swing he brought his gun
 down on Swann's face. Then as swiftly he turned on Thesel. Swann
 had hardly hit the floor, a sodden heap, when Thesel, with bloody
 visage, reeled and fell like a log. Lane bent over them, ready to
 beat either back. But both were unconscious.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren?for God's sake?don't murder them!" whispered
 Lorna, hoarsely.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane's humanity was in abeyance then, but his self-control did
 not desert him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You girls must hurry out of here," he ordered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Gail is fainting," cried Lorna.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little Williams girl was indeed swaying and sinking down.
 Lane grasped her and shook her. "Brace up. If you keel over now,
 you'll be found out sure.... It's all right. You'll not be hurt.
 There??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A heavy thumping on the door by which Lane had entered and a loud
 authoritative voice from the hall silenced him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Open up here! You're pinched!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That voice Lane recognized as belonging to Chief of Police Bell.
 For a moment, fraught with suspense, Lane was at a loss to know
 what to do.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Open up! We've got the place surrounded.... Open up, or we'll
 smash the door in!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane whispered to the girls: "Is there a place to hide you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Williams girl was beyond answering, but Lorna, despite her
 terror, had not lost her wits.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes?there's a closet?hid by a curtain?here,"
 she whispered, pointing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane half carried Gail. Lorna brushed aside a heavy curtain and
 opened a door. Lane pushed both girls into the black void and
 closed the door after them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Once more?open up!" bellowed the officer in the hall,
 accompanying his demand with a thump on the door. Lane made sure
 some one had found his axe. He did not care how much smashing the
 policemen did. All that concerned Lane then was how to avert
 discovery from the girls. It looked hopeless. Then, as there came
 sudden splintering blows on the door, Lane espied Swann's
 cigarettes and matches on the music box. Lane seldom smoked. But
 while the officers were breaking in the door, Lane leisurely
 lighted a cigarette; and when two of them came in he faced them
 coolly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The first was Chief Bell, a large handsome man, in blue uniform.
 The second one was a patrolman. Neither carried a weapon in
 sight. Bell swept the big room in one flashing blue
 glance?took in Lane and the prone figures on the floor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'll be damned," he ejaculated. "What am I up against?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Chief," replied Lane, coolly. "Don't get fussed up now.
 This is no murder case."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, what's this mean?" burst out Bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was rather well acquainted with Chief Bell, and in a way
 there was friendship between them. Bell, for one, had always been
 sturdily loyal to the soldiers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Chief, I was having a little friendly game with Mr. Swann
 and Captain Thesel," drawled Lane. "We got into an argument. And
 as both were such ferocious fighters I grew afraid they'd hurt me
 bad?so I had to soak them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't kid me," spoke up Bell, derisively. "Little
 game?hell! Where's the cards, chips, table?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chief, I didn't say we played the game to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you're a liar," replied Bell, thoughtfully. "I'm sure of
 that. But you've got me buffaloed." He knelt on the floor beside
 the fallen men and examined each. Swann's shirt as well as face
 was bloody. "For a crippled soldier you've got some punch left.
 What'd you hit them with?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll tell you Chief. I fetched an axe with me to do the dirty
 job, but I decided I should use a dangerous weapon only on men.
 So I soaked them with a lollypop."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, are you really nutty?" demanded Bell, curiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No more than you. I hit them with something hard, so it would
 leave a mark."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You left one, I'll say. Thesel will lose that eye?it's
 gone now?and Swann is also disfigured for life. What a
 damned shame!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chief, are you sure it's any kind of a shame?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane's query appeared to provoke thought. Bell replaced the
 little automatic pistol he had picked up beside Swann, and rising
 he looked at Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swann was a slacker. Thesel was your Captain in the war. Have
 these facts anything to do with your motive?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, Chief," replied Lane, in sarcasm. "But when I got into
 action I think the facts you mentioned sort of rejuvenated a
 disabled soldier."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, you beat me," declared Bell, shaking his head. "Why, I had
 you figured as a pretty good chap.... But you've done some queer
 things in Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Chief, if you're an honest officer you'll admit Middleville
 needs some queer things done."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Bell gazed doubtfully at Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Smith, search the rooms," he ordered, addressing his patrolman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We were alone here," spoke up Lane. "And I advise you to hurry
 those wounded veterans to a hospital in the rear."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann showed signs of recovering consciousness. Bell bent over
 him a moment. Lane had only one hope?that the patrolman
 would miss the door. But he brushed aside the curtain. Then he
 grunted.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "See here, Chief?a door?and somebody's holding it
 from the inside," he declared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait, Smith," ordered Bell, striding forward. But before he got
 half-way across the room the door opened. A girl stepped out and
 shut it back of her. Lane sustained a singular shock. That girl
 was Bessy Bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Dad?it's Bessy," she said, clearly. She was pale,
 but did not seem frightened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chief Bell halted in the middle of a stride and staggered a
 little as his foot came down. A low curse of utter amaze escaped
 his lips. Suddenly he became tensely animated.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How'd you come here?" he demanded, towering over her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I walked."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What'd you come for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To warn Daren Lane that you were going to raid these club-rooms
 to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who told you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't tell. I got it over the 'phone." I ran over here. I knew
 where the key was. I've been here
 before?afternoons?dancing.... I let myself in.... But
 when they?they came I got frightened and hid in the
 closet."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chief Bell seemed about to give way to passion, but he controlled
 it. After that moment he changed subtly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Daren Lane your friend?" he demanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. The best and truest any girl ever had.... Dad, you know
 mother told you I had changed lately. I have. And it's through
 Daren."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where'd you see him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "He has been coming out to the house in the afternoons."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I'm damned," muttered the Chief, and wheeled away. Sight
 of his gaping patrolman seemed to galvanize him into further
 realization of the situation. "Smith, beat it out and draw the
 other men round in front. Give me time enough to get Bessy out.
 Send hurry call for ambulance.... And Smith, keep your mouth
 shut. I'll make it all right. If Mrs. Bell hears of this my life
 will be a hell on earth."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mum's the word, Chief. I'm a married man myself," he replied,
 and hurried out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was watching Bessy. What a wonderful girl! Modern tendencies
 might have corrupted the girls of the day, but for sheer nerve,
 wit and courage they were immeasurably superior to those of
 former generations. Bessy faced her father calmly, lied
 magnificently, gazed down at the ghastly, bloody faces with
 scarcely a shudder, and gave Lane a smile from her purple eyes,
 as if to cheer him, to assure him she could save the situation.
 It struck Lane that Chief Bell looked as if he might be following
 a similar line of thought.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, put on your hat," ordered Bell. "And here ... tuck that
 veil around. There, now you beat it for home. Lane, go with her
 to the stairs. Take a good look in the street. Bessy, go home the
 back way. And Lane, you hurry back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane followed Bessy out and caught up with her in the hall. She
 clasped his arm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Some adventure, I'll say!" she burst out, in breathless whisper.
 "It was great until I recognized your voice. Then all inside me
 went flooey."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, you're the finest little girl in the world," returned
 Lane, stirred to emotion.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here, Daren, cut that. You didn't raise me on soft soap and
 mush. If you get to praising me I'll fall so far I'll never
 light.... Now, Dare, go back and fool Dad. You must save the
 girls. It doesn't matter about me. He's my Dad."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll do my best," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They reached the landing of the outside stairway. Peering down,
 Lane did not see any one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess the coast is clear. Now, beat it, Bessy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She lifted the white veil and raised her face. In the dim gray
 light Lane saw it as never before.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Kiss me, Daren," she whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had never kissed her. For an instant he was confused.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why?little girl!" he exclaimed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurry!" she whispered, imperiously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some instinct beyond Lane's ken prompted him to do what she
 asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Good-bye, my little Princess," he whispered. "Don't ever forget
 me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never, Daren. Good-bye." She slipped down the stairway and in a
 moment more vanished in the gray gloom of the misty night.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Only then did Lane understand what she, with her woman's
 intuition, had divined?that they would never be together
 again. The realization gave him a pang. Bessy was his only
 victory.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Slowly Lane made his way back to the club-rooms. He had begun to
 weaken under the strain and felt the approach of something akin
 to collapse. When he reached the large room he found Swann half
 conscious and Thesel showing signs of coming to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane, come here," said the Chief, drawing Lane away from the
 writhing forms on the floor. "You're under arrest."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, sir. What's the charge?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Let's see. That's the puzzler," replied the Chief, scratching
 his head. "Suppose we say gambling and fighting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine!" granted Lane, with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "When the ambulance comes you get out of sight until we pack
 these fellows out. I'll leave the door open?so if there's
 any reason you want to come back?why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Chief Bell half averted his face, seemingly not embarrassed, but
 rather pondering in thought. "Thanks, Chief. You understand me
 perfectly," responded Lane. "I'll appear at police headquarters
 in half an hour."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The officer laughed, and returning to the injured men he knelt
 beside them. Swann sat up moaning. Blood had blinded his sight.
 He did not see Lane pass. Sounds of an ambulance bell had caught
 Lane's quick ear. Finding the washroom, he went in and, locking
 the door, leaned there to wait. In a very few moments the injured
 Swann and Thesel had been carried out. Lane waited five minutes
 after the sound of wheels had died away. Then he hurried out and
 opened the door of the closet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lorna almost fell over him in her eagerness. If she had been
 frightened, she had recovered. Gail staggered out, pale and sick
 looking.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren, can you get us out?" whispered Lorna, breathlessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hurry, and don't talk," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He led them out into the hall and down to the stairway where he
 had taken Bessy. As before, all appeared quiet below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess it's safe.... Girls, let this be a lesson to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never any more for mine," whimpered Gail.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Lorna was of more tempered metal.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Believe me, Daren, I'm glad you knocked the lamps out of those
 swell boobs," she whispered, passionately. "Dick Swann used me
 like dirt. The next guy like him who tries to get gay with me
 will have some fall, I'll tell the world.... Me for Harry!
 There's nothing in this q-t stuff.... And say, what do you know
 about Bessy Bell? She came here to save us.... Hot dog, but she's
 a peach!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane admonished the girls to hurry and watched them until they
 reached the street and turned the corner out of sight.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVII
 </h2>
 <p>
 The reaction from that night landed Lane in the hospital, where,
 during long weeks when he did have a lucid interval, he saw that
 his life was despaired of and felt that he was glad of it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he did not die. As before, the weak places in his lungs
 healed over and he began to mend, and gradually his periods of
 rationality increased until he wholly gained his mental poise. It
 was, however, a long time before he was strong enough to leave
 the hospital.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 During the worst of his illness his mother came often to see him;
 after he grew better she came but seldom. Blair and Colonel
 Pepper were the only others who visited Lane. And as soon as his
 memory returned and interest revived he learned much peculiarly
 significant to him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The secret of the club-rooms, so far as girls were concerned,
 never became fully known to Middleville gossips. Strange and
 contrary rumors were rife for a long time, but the real truth
 never leaked out. There was never any warrant sworn for Lane's
 arrest. What the general public had heard and believed was the
 story concocted by Thesel and Swann, who claimed that Lane, over
 a gambling table, had been seized by one of the frenzied fits
 common to deranged soldiers, and had attacked them. Thesel lost
 his left eye and Swann carried a hideous red scar from brow to
 cheek. Neither the club-room scandal nor his disfigurement for
 life in any wise prevented Mrs. Maynard from announcing the
 engagement of her daughter Margaret to Richard Swann. The most
 amazing news was to hear that Helen Wrapp had married a rich
 young politician named Hartley, who was running for the office of
 magistrate. According to Blair, Daren Lane had divided
 Middleville into two dissenting factions, a large one who banned
 him in disgrace, and a small one who lifted their voices in his
 behalf. Of all the endless bits of news, little and big, the one
 that broke happily on Lane's ears was the word of a nurse, who
 told him that during his severe illness a girl had called on the
 telephone every day to inquire for him. She never gave her name.
 But Lane knew it was Mel and the mere thought of her made him
 quiver.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 By the time Lane was strong enough to leave the hospital an early
 winter had set in. The hospital expenses had reduced his finances
 so materially that he could not afford the lodgings he had
 occupied before his illness. He realized fully that he should
 leave Middleville for a dry warm climate, if he wanted to live a
 while longer. But he was not greatly concerned about this. There
 would be time enough to consider the future after he had
 fulfilled the one hope and ambition he had left.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rooms were at a premium. Lane was forced to apply in the sordid
 quarter of Middleville, and the place he eventually found was a
 small, bare hall bedroom, in a large, ramshackle old house, of
 questionable repute. But beggars could not be choosers. There was
 no heat in this room, and Lane decided that what time he spent in
 it must be in bed. He would not give any one his address.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once installed here, Lane waited only a few days to assure
 himself that he was strong enough to carry out the plan upon
 which he had set his heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Late that afternoon he went to the town hall and had a marriage
 license made out for himself and Mel Iden. Upon returning, he
 found that snow had begun to fall heavily. Already the streets
 were white. Suddenly the thought of the nearness of Christmas
 shocked him. How time sped by!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That night he dressed himself carefully, wearing the service
 uniform he had so well preserved, and sallied forth to the most
 fashionable restaurant in Middleville, where in the glare and
 gayety he had his dinner. Lane recognized many of the dining,
 dancing throng, but showed no sign of it. He became aware that
 his presence had excited comment. How remote he seemed to feel
 himself from that eating, drinking, dancing crowd! So far removed
 that even the jazz music no longer affronted him. Rather
 surprised he was to find he really enjoyed his dinner. From the
 restaurant he engaged a taxi.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The bright lights, the falling snow, the mantle of white on
 everything, with their promise of the holiday season, pleased
 Lane with the memory of what great fun he used to have at
 Christmas-time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he arrived at Mel's home the snow was falling thickly in
 heavy flakes. Through the pall he caught a faint light, which
 grew brighter as he plodded toward the cottage. He stamped on the
 porch and flapped his arms to remove the generous covering of
 snow that had adhered to him. And as he was about to knock, the
 door opened, and Mel stood in the sudden brightness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Mel, how are you??some snow, eh?" was his cheery
 greeting, and he went in and shut the door behind him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Daren?you?you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I?what! Aren't you glad to see me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane had not prepared himself for anything. He knew he could win
 now, and all he had allowed himself was gladness. But being face
 to face with Mel made it different. It had been long since he
 last saw her. That interval had been generous. To look at her now
 no one could have guessed her story. Warmth and richness of color
 had come back to her; and vividly they expressed her joy at sight
 of him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Glad??I've been living?on my hopes?that
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her faltering speech trailed off here, as Lane took one long
 stride toward her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane put a firm hand to each of her cheeks, and tilting a
 suddenly rosy face, he kissed her full on the lips. Then he
 turned away without looking at her and stepped to the little open
 grate, where a small red fire glowed. Mel gasped there behind him
 and then became perfectly still.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Nice fire, Mel," he spoke out, naturally, as if nothing unusual
 had happened. But the thin hands he extended to the warmth of the
 coals trembled like aspen leaves in the wind. How silent she was!
 It thrilled him. What strange sweet revel in the moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When he turned it seemed he saw her eyes, her lips, her whole
 face luminous. The next instant she came out of her spell; and
 Lane divined if he let her wholly recover, he would have a woman
 to deal with.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, what's wrong with you?" she inquired.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, Mel!" he ejaculated, in feigned reproach.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You don't look irrational, but you act so," she said, studying
 him more closely. The hand that had been pressed to her breast
 dropped down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Had my last crazy spell two weeks ago," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Until to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You mean my kissing you? Well, I refuse to apologize. You see I
 was not prepared to find you so improved. Why, Mel, you're
 changed. You're just?just lovely."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again the rich color stained her cheeks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Thank you, Daren," she said. "I have changed. <i>You</i> did
 it.... I've gotten well, and?almost happy.... But let's not
 talk of myself. You?there's so much?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I don't want to talk about myself, either," he declared.
 "When a man's got only a day or so longer?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush!?Or?Or?," she threatened, with a slight
 distension of nostrils and a paling of cheek.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or what?" demanded Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Or I'll do to you what you did to me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you'd kiss me to shut my lips?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I would."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine, Mel. Come on. But you'd have to keep steadily busy all
 evening. For I've come to talk." Mel came closer to him, with a
 catch in her breathing, a loving radiance in her eyes. "Daren,
 you're strange?not like your old self. You're too
 gay?too happy. Oh, I'd be glad if you were sincere. But you
 have something on your mind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane knew when to unmask a battery.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, it's in my pocket," he flashed, and with a quick motion he
 tore out the marriage license and thrust it upon her. As her dark
 eyes took in the meaning of the paper, and her expression
 changed, Lane gazed down upon her with a commingling of emotions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren?No?No!" she cried, in a wildness of amaze
 and pain.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Lane clasped her close, with a force too sudden to be
 gentle, and with his free hand he lifted her face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Look here. Look at me," he said sternly. "Every time you say no
 or shake your head?I'll do this."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And he kissed her twice, as he had upon his entrance.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel raised her head and gazed up at him, wide-eyed, open-mouthed,
 as if both appalled and enthralled.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren. I?I don't understand you," she said, unsteadily.
 "You frighten me. Let me go?please, Daren. This
 is?so?so unlike you. You insult me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I can't see it that way," he replied. "I'm only asking you
 to come out and marry me to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That galvanized her, and she tried to slip from his embrace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told you no?no?no," she cried desperately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's three," said Lane, and he took them mercilessly. "You
 will marry me," he said sternly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren, I can't?I dare not.... Ah!?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You will go right now?marry me to-night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Please be kind, Daren.... I don't know how you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, where're your coat, and hat, and overshoes?" he questioned,
 urgently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I told you?no!" she flashed, passionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane made good his threat, and this last onslaught left her spent
 and white.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You must like my kisses, Mel Iden," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I implore you?Daren"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I implore you to marry me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dear friend, listen to reason," she begged. "You don't love me.
 You've just a chivalrous notion you can help me?and my
 boy?by giving us your name. It's noble, Daren, thank you.
 But?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Take care," warned Lane, bending low over her. "I can make good
 my word all night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Boy, you've gone crazy," she whispered, sadly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, now you may be talking sense," he laughed. "But that's
 neither here nor there.... Mel, I may die any day now!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, my God!?don't say that," she cried, as if pierced by a
 blade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Mel, make me happy just for that little while."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Happy?" she whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. I've failed here in every way. I've lost all. And this
 thing would make the bitterness endurable."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd die for you," she returned. "But marry
 you!?Daren?dearest?it will make you the
 laughing-stock of Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Whatever it makes me, I shall be proud."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I cannot, I dare not," she burst out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You seem to forget the penalty for these unflattering negatives
 of yours," he returned, coolly, bending to her lips.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 This time she did not writhe or quiver or breathe. Lane felt
 surrender in her, and when he lifted his face from hers he was
 sure. Despite the fact that he had inflexibly clamped his will to
 one purpose, holding his emotion in abeyance, that brief instant
 seemed to be the fullest of his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, put your arm round my neck," he commanded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel obeyed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now the other."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Again she complied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lift your face?look at me."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She essayed to do this also, but failed. Her head sank on his
 breast. He had won. Lane held her a moment closely. And then a
 great and overwhelming pity and tenderness, his first emotions,
 flooded his soul. He closed his eyes. Dimly, vaguely, they seemed
 to create vision of long future time; and he divined that good
 and happiness would come to Mel Iden some day through the pain he
 had given her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where did you say your things are?" he asked. "It's a bad
 night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "They're in?the hall," came in muffled tones from his
 shoulder. "I'll get them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But she made no effort to remove her arms from round his neck or
 to lift her head from his breast. Lane had lost now that singular
 exaltation of will, and power to hold down his emotions. Her
 nearness stormed his heart. His test came then, when he denied
 utterance to the love that answered hers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?Mel?you stay here," he said, freeing himself.
 "I'll get them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Opening the hall door he saw the hat-rack where as a boy he had
 hung his cap. It now held garments over which Lane fumbled. Mel
 came into the hall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, you'll not know which are mine," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane watched her. How the shapely hands trembled. Her face shone
 white against her dark furs. Lane helped her put on the
 overshoes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now?just a word to mother," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane caught her hand and held it, following her to the end of the
 hall, where she opened a door and peeped into the sitting-room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mother, is dad home?" she asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No?he's out, and such a bad night! Who's with you, Mel?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, is he up again? I'm glad. Bring him in.... Why, Mel, you've
 your hat and coat on!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, mother dear. We're going out for a while."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "On such a night! What for?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren and I are going to?to be married.... Good-bye. No
 more till we come back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As one in a dream, Lane led Mel out in the whirling white pall of
 snow. It seemed to envelop them. It was mysterious and friendly,
 and silent.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They crossed the bridge, and Lane again listened for the river
 voices that always haunted here. Were they only murmurings of
 swift waters? Beyond the bridge lay the railroad station. A few
 dim lights shone through the white gloom. Lane found a taxi.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They were silent during the ride through the lonely streets. When
 the taxi stopped at the address given the driver, Lane whispered
 a word to Mel, jumped out and ran up the steps of a house and
 rang the bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is Doctor McCullen at home?" he inquired of the maid who
 answered the ring. He was informed the minister had just gone to
 his room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will you ask him to come down upon a matter of importance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The maid invited him inside. In a few moments a tall,
 severe-looking man wearing a long dressing-coat entered the
 parlor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor McCullen, I regret disturbing you, but my business is
 urgent. I want to be married at once. The lady is outside in a
 car. May I bring her in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah! I seem to remember you. Isn't your name Lane?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is the woman you want to marry?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Iden."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Miss Iden! You mean Joshua Iden's daughter?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I do."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The minister showed a grave surprise. "Aren't you rather late in
 making amends? No, I will not marry you until I investigate the
 matter," he replied, coldly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You need not trouble yourself," replied Lane curtly, and went
 out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The instant opposition stimulated Lane, and he asked the driver,
 "John, do you know where we can find a preacher?" "Yis, sor. Mr.
 Peters of the Methodist Church lives round the corner," answered
 the man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Drive on, then."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane got inside the taxi and slammed the door. "Mel, he refused
 to marry us."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel was silent, but the pressure of her hand answered him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, the car has stopped," said Mel, presently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane got out, walked up the steps, and pulled the bell. He was
 admitted. He had no better luck here. Lane felt that his lips
 shut tight, and his face set. Mel said nothing and sat by him,
 very quiet. The taxi rolled on and stopped again, and Lane had
 audience with another minister. He was repulsed here also.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We're trying a magistrate," said Lane, when the car stopped
 again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "But, Daren. This is where Gerald Hartley lives. Not him, Daren.
 Surely you wouldn't go to him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not?" inquired Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It hasn't been two months since he married Helen Wrapp. Hadn't
 you heard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'd forgotten," said Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Besides, Daren, he?he once asked me to marry
 him?before the war."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane hesitated. Yes, he now remembered that in the days before
 the war the young lawyer had been Mel's persistent admirer. But a
 reckless mood had begun to manifest itself in Lane during the
 last hour, and it must have communicated its spirit to Mel, for
 she made no further protest. The world was against them. They
 were driving to the home of the man she had refused to marry, who
 had eventually married a girl who had jilted Lane. In an ordinary
 moment they would never have attempted such a thing. The mansion
 before which the car stopped was well lighted; music and laughter
 came faintly through the bright windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A maid opened the door to Lane and showed him into a
 drawing-room. In a library beyond he saw women and men playing
 cards, laughing and talking. Several old ladies were sitting
 close together, whispering and nodding their heads. A young
 fair-haired girl was playing the piano. Lane saw the maid advance
 and speak to a sharp-featured man whom he recognized as Hartley.
 Lane wanted to run out of the house. But he clenched his teeth
 and swore he would go through with it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Hartley," began Lane, as the magistrate came through the
 curtained doorway, "I hope you'll pardon my intrusion. My errand
 is important. I've come to ask you to marry me to a lady who is
 waiting outside."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Hartley recognized his visitor he started back in
 astonishment. Then he laughed and looked more closely at Lane. It
 was a look that made Lane wince, for he understood it to relate
 to his mental condition.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lane! Well, by Jove!" he exclaimed. "Going to get married! You
 honor me. The regular fee, which in my official capacity I must
 charge, is one dollar. If you can pay that I will marry you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can pay," replied Lane, quietly, and his level steady gaze
 disconcerted Hartley.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Where's the woman?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's outside in a taxi."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is she over eighteen?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane expected the question as to who the woman was. It was
 singular that the magistrate neglected to ask this, the first
 query offered by every minister Lane has visited.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fetch her in," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went outside and hesitated at the car door, for he had an
 intuitive flash which made him doubtful. But what if Hartley did
 make a show of this marriage? The marriage itself was the vital
 thing. Lane helped Mel out of the car and led her up the icy
 steps. The maid again opened the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Lane, walk right in," said Hartley. "Of course, it's natural
 for the lady to be a little shy, but then if she wants to be
 married at this hour she must not mind my family and guests. They
 can be witnesses."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He spoke in a voice in which Lane's ears detected insincerity.
 "Be seated, and wait until I get my book," he continued, and left
 the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Hartley had hardly glanced at Mel, and her veil had hidden her
 features. He had gone toward his study rubbing his hands in a
 peculiar manner which Lane remembered and which recalled the man
 as he had looked many a time in the Bradford billiard room when a
 good joke was going the rounds. Lane saw him hurry from his study
 with pleasant words of invitation to his guests, a mysterious air
 about him, a light upon his face. The ladies and gentlemen rose
 from their tables and advanced from the library to the door of
 the drawing-room. A girl of striking figure seized Hartley's arm
 and gesticulated almost wildly. It was Helen Wrapp. Her husband
 laughed at her and waved a hand toward the drawing-room and his
 guests. Turning swiftly with tigerish grace, she bent upon Lane
 great green eyes whose strange expression he could not fathom.
 What passionately curious eyes did she now fasten on his
 prospective bride!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane gripped Mel's hand. He felt the horror of what might be
 coming. What a blunder he had made!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Will the lady kindly remove her veil?" Hartley's voice sounded
 queer. His smile had vanished.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Mel untied and thrust back the veil her fingers trembled. The
 action disclosed a lovely face as white as snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "<i>Mel Iden</i>!" burst from the magistrate. For a moment there
 was an intense silence. Then, "I'll not marry you," cried Hartley
 vindictively.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why not? You said you would," demanded Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Not to save your worthless lives," Hartley returned, facing them
 with a dark meaning in his eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned to Mel and led her from the house and down to the
 curb without speaking once.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more they went out into the blinding snow-storm. Lane threw
 back his head and breathed the cold air. What a relief to get out
 of that stifling room!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I'm afraid it's no use," he said, finally.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We are finding what the world thinks of us," replied Mel. "Tell
 the man to drive to 204 Locust Street."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more the driver headed his humming car into the white storm.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more Lane sat silent, with his heart raging. Once more Mel
 peered out into the white turmoil of gloom.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, we're going to Dr. Wallace, my old minister. He'll marry
 us," she said, presently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why didn't I think of him?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did," answered Mel, in a low voice. "I know he would marry us.
 He baptized me; he has known and loved me all my life. I used to
 sing in his choir and taught his Sunday School for years."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yet you let me go to those others. Why?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Because I shrank from going to him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more the car lurched into the gutter, and this time they
 both got out and mounted the high steps. Lane knocked. They
 waited what appeared a long time before they heard some one
 fumbling with the lock. Just then the bell in the church tower
 nearby began chiming the midnight hour. The door opened, and
 Doctor Wallace himself admitted them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! Who's this?... Why, if it's not Mel Iden! What a night to
 be out in!" he exclaimed. He led them into a room, evidently his
 study, where a cheerful wood fire blazed. There he took both her
 hands and looked from her to Lane. "You look so white and
 distressed. This late hour?this young man whom I know. What
 has happened? Why do you come to me?the first time in so
 many months?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To ask you to marry us," answered Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To <i>marry</i> you?... Is this the soldier who wronged you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. This is Daren Lane.... He wants to marry me to give my boy a
 name.... Somehow he finally made me consent."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, well, here is a story. Come, take off this snowy cloak and
 get nearer the fire. Your hands are like ice." His voice was very
 calm and kind. It soothed Lane's strained nerves. With what
 eagerness did he scrutinize the old minister's face. He knew the
 penetrating eye, the lofty brow and white hair, the serious lined
 face, sad in a noble austerity. But the lips were kind with that
 softness and sweetness which comes from gentle words and frequent
 smiles. Lane's aroused antagonism vanished in the old man's
 presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor Wallace," went on Mel. "We have been to several
 ministers, and to Mr. Hartley, the magistrate. All refused to
 marry us. So I came to my old friend. You've known me all my
 life. Daren has at last convinced me?broke down my
 resistance. So?I ask?will you marry us?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Wallace was silent for many moments while he gazed into
 the fire and stroked her hand. Suddenly a smile broke over his
 fine face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You say you asked Hartley to marry you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, we went to him. It was a reckless thing to do. I'm sorry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "To say the least, it was original." The old minister seemed to
 have difficulty in restraining a laugh. Then for a moment he
 pondered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My friends, I am very old," he said at length, "but you have
 taught me something. I will marry you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was a strange marriage. Behind Mel and Daren stood the
 red-faced, grinning driver, his coarse long coat covered with
 snow, and the simpering housemaid, respectful, yet glorifying in
 her share in this midnight romance. The old minister with his
 striking face and white hair, gravely turned the leaves of his
 book. No bridegroom ever wore such a stern, haggard countenance.
 The bride's face might have been a happier one, but it could not
 have been more beautiful.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Wallace's voice was low and grave; it quavered here and
 there in passages. Lane's was hardly audible. Mel's rang deep and
 full.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The witnesses signed their names; husband and wife wrote theirs;
 the minister filled out the license, and the ceremony was over.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Doctor Wallace took a hand of each.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel and Daren," he said. "No human can read the secret ways of
 God. But it seems there is divinity in you both. You have been
 sacrificed to the war. You are builders, not destroyers. You are
 Christians, not pagans. You have a vision limned against the
 mystery of the future. Mammon seems now to rule. Civilization
 rocks on its foundations. But the world will go on growing
 better. Peace on earth, good will to men! That is the ultimate.
 It was Christ's teaching.... You two give me greater faith.... Go
 now and face the world with heads erect?whatever you do,
 Mel?and however long you live, Daren. Who can tell what
 will happen? But time proves all things, and the blindness of
 people does not last forever.... You both belong to the Kingdom
 of God."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But few words were spoken by Lane or Mel on the ride home. Mel
 seemed lost in a trance. She had one hand slipped under Lane's
 arm, the other clasped over it. As for Lane, he had overestimated
 his strength. A deadly numbness attacked his nerves, and he had
 almost lost the sense of touch. When they arrived at Mel's home
 the snow-storm had abated somewhat, and the lighted windows of
 the cottage shone brightly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane helped Mel wade through the deep snow, or he pretended to
 help her, for in reality he needed her support more than she
 needed his. They entered the warm little parlor. Some one had
 replenished the fire. The clock pointed to the hour of one. Lane
 laid the marriage certificate on the open book Mel had been
 reading. Mel threw off hat, coat, overshoes and gloves. Her hair
 was wet with melted snow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Now, Daren Lane," she said softly. "Now that you have made me
 your wife?!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Up until then Lane had been master of the situation. He had
 thought no farther than this moment. And now he weakened. Was
 this beautiful woman, with head uplifted and eyes full of fire,
 the Mel Iden of his school days? Now that he had made her his
 wife?.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, there's no <i>now</i> for me," he replied, with a sad
 finality. "From this moment, I'll live in the past. I have no
 future.... Thank God, you let me do what I could. I'll try to
 come again soon. But I must go now. I'm afraid?I overtaxed
 my strength."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, you look so?so," she faltered. "Stay, Daren?and
 let me nurse you.... We have a little spare room, warm, cozy.
 I'll wait on you, Daren. Oh, it would mean so much to
 me?now I am your wife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The look of her, the tones of her voice, made him weak. Then he
 thought of his cold, sordid lodgings, and he realized that one
 more moment here alone with Mel Iden would make him a coward in
 his own eyes. He thanked her, and told her how impossible it was
 for him to stay, and bidding her good night he reeled out into
 the white gloom. At the gate he was already tired; at the bridge
 he needed rest. Once more, then, he heard the imagined voices of
 the waters calling to him.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XVIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Seldom did Blair Maynard ever trust himself any more in the
 presence of his mother's guests. Since Mrs. Maynard had announced
 the engagement of his sister Margaret to Richard Swann, she had
 changed remarkably. Blair did not love her any the better for the
 change. All his life, as long as he could remember, he and
 Margaret had hated pretension, and the littleness of living
 beyond their means. But now, with this one <i>coup d'etat,</i>
 his mother had regained her position as the leader of Middleville
 society. Haughty, proud, forever absorbed in the material side of
 everything, she moved in a self-created atmosphere Blair could
 not abide. He went hungry many a time rather than sit at table
 with guests such as Mrs. Maynard delighted to honor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair and Margaret had become estranged, and Blair spent most of
 his time alone, reading or dreaming, but mostly sleeping. He knew
 he grew weaker every day and his weakness appeared to induce
 slumber.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 On New Year's day, after dinner, he fell asleep in a big chair,
 across the hall from the drawing-room. And when he awoke the
 drawing-room was full of people making New Year's calls. If there
 was anything Blair hated it was to thump on his crutch past
 curious, cold-eyed persons. So he remained where he was, hoping
 not to be seen. But unfortunately for him, he had exceedingly
 keen ears and exceedingly sensitive feelings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Some of the guests he knew very well without having to see them.
 The Swanns, and Fanchon Smith, with her brother and mother,
 Gerald Hartley and his bride, Helen Wrapp, and a number of others
 prominent as Middleville's elect were recognizable by their
 voices. While he was sitting there, trying not to hear what he
 could not help hearing, a number more arrived.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They talked. It gradually dawned on Blair that some gossip was
 rife anent a midnight marriage between his friend Daren Lane and
 Mel Iden. Blair was deeply shocked. Then his emotions, never
 calm, grew poignant. He listened. What he heard spoken of Daren
 and Mel made his blood boil. Sweet voices, low-pitched,
 well-modulated, with the intonation of culture, made witty and
 scarcely veiled remarks of a suggestiveness that gave rise to
 laughter. Voices of men, bland, blase, deriding Daren Lane! Blair
 listened, and slowly his passion mounted to a white heat. And
 then it seemed, fate fully, in a lull of the conversation, some
 one remarked graciously to Mrs. Maynard that it was a pity that
 Blair had lost a leg in the war.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair thumped up on his crutch, and thumped across the hall to
 confront this assembly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, pray pardon me," he said, in his
 high-pitched tenor, cold now, and under perfect control. "I could
 not help hearing your conversation. And I cannot help
 illuminating your minds. It seems exceedingly strange to me that
 people of intelligence should make the blunders they do. So
 strange that in the future I intend to take such as you have made
 as nothing but the plain cold fact of perversion of human nature!
 Daren Lane is so far above your comprehension that it seems
 useless to defend him. I have never done it before. He would not
 thank me. But this once I will speak.... In our group of service
 men?so few of whom came home?he was a hero. We all
 loved him. And for soldiers at war that tribute is the greatest.
 If there was a dirty job to be done, Daren Lane volunteered for
 it. If there was a comrade to be helped, Daren Lane was the first
 to see it. He never thought of himself. The dregs of war did not
 engulf him as they did so many of us. He was true to his ideal.
 He would have been advanced for honors many a time but for the
 enmity of our captain. He won the <i>Croix de Guerre</i> by as
 splendid a feat as I saw during the war.... Thank God, we had
 some officers who treated us like men?who were men
 themselves. But for the majority we common soldiers were merely
 beasts of burden, dogs to drive. This captain of whom I speak was
 a padded shape?shirker from the front line?a parader
 of his uniform before women. And he is that to-day?a chaser
 of women?girls?<i>girls</i> of fifteen.... Yet he has
 the adulation of Middleville while Daren Lane is an outcast....
 My God, is there no justice? At home here Daren Lane has not done
 one thing that was not right. Some of the gossip about him is as
 false as hell. He has tried to do noble things. If he married Mel
 Iden, as you say, it was in some exalted mood to help her, or to
 give his name to her poor little nameless boy."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair paused a moment in a deliberate speech that toward the end
 had grown breathless. The faces before him seemed swaying in a
 mist.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "As for myself," he continued in passionate hurry, "I did not
 <i>lose</i> my leg!... I <i>sacrificed</i> it. I <i>gave</i> my
 career, my youth, my health, my body?and I will soon have
 given my life?for my country and my people. I was proud to
 do it. Never for a moment have I regretted it.... What I
 lost?Ah! what I <i>lost</i> was respect for"?Blair
 choked?"for the institution that had deluded me. What I
 <i>lost</i> was not my leg but my faith in God, in my country, in
 the gratitude of men left at home, in the honor of women."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Friday, the tenth of January, dawned cold, dark, dreary, and all
 day a dull clouded sky promised rain or snow. From a bride's
 point of view it was not a propitious day for a wedding. A half
 hour before five o'clock a stream of carriages began to flow
 toward St. Marks and promptly at five the door of the church shut
 upon a large and fashionable assembly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The swelling music of the wedding march pealed out. The bridal
 party filed into the church. The organ peals hushed. The resonant
 voice of a minister, with sing-song solemnity, began the marriage
 service.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret Maynard knew she stood there in the flesh, yet the
 shimmering white satin, the flowing veil, covered some one who
 was a stranger to her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And this other, this strange being who dominated her movements,
 stood passively and willingly by, while her despairing and truer
 self saw the shame and truth. She was a lie. The guests, friends,
 attendants, bridesmaids, the minister, the father, mother,
 groom?all were lies. They expressed nothing of their true
 feelings.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The unwelcomed curious, who had crowded into the back of the
 church, were the sincerest, for in their eyes, covetousness was
 openly unveiled. The guests and friends wore the conventional
 shallow smiles of guests and friends. They whispered to one
 another?a beautiful wedding?a gorgeous gown?a
 perfect bride?a handsome groom; and exclaimed in their
 hearts: How sad the father! How lofty, proud, exultant the
 mother! How like her to move heaven and earth to make this
 marriage! The attendants posed awkwardly, a personification of
 the uselessness of their situation, and they pitied the bride
 while they envied him for whose friendship they stood. The
 bridesmaids graced their position and gloried in it, and serenely
 smiled, and thought that to be launched in life in such dazzling
 manner might be compensation for the loss of much. He of the
 flowing robe, of the saintly expression, of the trained
 earnestness, the minister who had power to unite these lives, saw
 nothing behind that white veil, saw only his fashionable
 audience, while his resonant voice rolled down the aisles of the
 church: "Who gives this woman to be wedded to this man?" The
 father answered and straightway the years rolled back to his
 youth, to hope, to himself as he stood at the altar with love and
 trust, and then again to the present, to the failure of health
 and love and life, to the unalterable destiny accorded him, to
 the one shame of an honest if unsuccessful life?the
 countenancing of this marriage. The worldly mother had, for once,
 a full and swelling heart. For her this was the crowning moment.
 In one sense this fashionable crowd had been pitted against her
 and she had won. What to her had been the pleading of a daughter,
 the importunity of a father, the reasoning of a few old-fashioned
 friends? The groom, who represented so much and so little in this
 ceremony, had entered the church with head held high, had faced
 his bride with gratified smile and the altar with serene
 unconsciousness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret Maynard saw all this; saw even the bride, with her
 splendidly regular loveliness; and then, out of heaven, it seemed
 there thundered an awful command, rolling the dream away,
 striking terror to her heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be
 joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever
 hold his peace!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One long, silent, terrible moment! Would not an angel appear,
 with flaming sword, to smite her dead? But the sing-song voice
 went on, like flowing silk.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The last guest at Mrs. Maynard's reception had gone, reluctantly,
 out into the snow, and the hostess sat in her drawing-room, amid
 the ruins of flowers and palms. She was alone with her triumph.
 Mr. Maynard and Mr. Swann were smoking in the library. Owing to
 the storm and delicate health of the bride the wedding journey
 had been postponed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret was left alone, at length, in the little blue-and-white
 room which had known her as a child and maiden, where she now sat
 as wife. For weeks past she had been emotionless. To-night, with
 that trenchant command, unanswered except in her heart, a spasm
 of pain had broken the serenity of her calm, and had left her
 quivering.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It is done," she whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The endless stream of congratulations, meaningless and abhorrent
 to her, the elaborate refreshments, the warm embraces of old
 friends had greatly fatigued her. But she could not rest. She
 paced the little room; she passed the beautiful white bridal
 finery, so neatly folded by the bridesmaids, and she averted her
 eyes. She seemed not to hate her mother, nor love her father; she
 had no interest in her husband. She was slipping back again into
 that creature apart from her real self.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The house became very quiet; the snow brushed softly against the
 windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A step in the hall made Margaret pause like a listening deer; a
 tap sounded lightly on her door; a voice awoke her at last to
 life and to torture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Margaret, may I come in?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was Swann's voice, a little softer than usual, with a subtle
 eagerness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No" answered Margaret, involuntarily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I beg your pardon. I'll wait." Swann's footsteps died away in
 the direction of the library.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The spring of a panther was in Margaret's action as she began to
 repace the room. All her blood quickened to the thought suggested
 by her husband's soft voice. In the mirror she saw a crimsoned
 face and shamed eyes from which she turned away.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All the pain and repression, the fight and bitter resignation and
 trained indifference of the past months were as if they had never
 been. This was her hour of real agony; now was the time to pay
 the price. Pride, honor, love never smothered, reserve rooted in
 the very core of a sensitive woman's heart, availed nothing. Once
 again catching sight of her reflection in the mirror she stopped
 before it, and crossing her hands on her heaving breast, she
 regarded herself with scorn. She was false to her love, she was
 false to herself, false to the man to whom she had sold herself.
 "Oh! Why did I yield!" she cried. She was a coward; she belonged
 to the luxurious class that would suffer anything rather than
 lose position. Fallen had she as low as any of them; gold had
 been the price of her soul. To keep her position she must marry
 one man when she loved another. She cried out in her
 wretchedness; she felt in her whole being a bitter humiliation;
 she felt stir in her a terrible tumult.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Margaret wondered how many thousands of girls had been similarly
 placed, and pitied them. She thought of the atmosphere in which
 she lived, where it seemed to her every mother was possessed
 singularly and entirely of one aim, to marry her daughter as soon
 as possible to a man as rich as possible. Marrying well simply
 meant marrying money. Only a few days before her mother had come
 to her and said: "Mrs. Fisher called and she was telling me about
 her daughter Alice. It seems Alice is growing very pretty and
 very popular. She said she was afraid Alice had taken, a liking
 to that Brandeth fellow, who's only a clerk. So Mrs. Fisher
 intends taking Alice to the seashore this summer, to an exclusive
 resort, of course, but one where there will be excitement and
 plenty of young gentlemen."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At the remembrance Margaret gave a little contemptuous laugh. A
 year ago she would not have divined the real purport of her
 mother's words. How easy that was now! Mrs. Fisher had decided
 that as Alice was eighteen it was time a suitable husband was
 found for her. Poor Alice! Balls, parties, receptions there would
 be, and trips to the seashore and all the other society
 manoeuvers, made ostensibly to introduce Alice to the world; but
 if the truth were told in cold blood all this was simply a
 parading of the girl before a number of rich and marriageable
 men. Poor Harry Brandeth!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She recalled many marriages of friends and acquaintances. With
 strange intensity of purpose she brought each one to mind, and
 thought separately and earnestly over her. What melancholy facts
 this exercise revealed! She could not recall one girl who was
 happy, perfectly happy, unless it was Jane Silvey who ran off
 with and married a telegraph operator. Jane was still bright-eyed
 and fresh, happy no doubt in her little house with her work and
 her baby, even though her people passed her by as if she were a
 stranger. Then Margaret remembered with a little shock there was
 another friend, a bride who had been found on her wedding night
 wandering in the fields. There had been some talk, quickly
 hushed, of a drunken husband, but it had never definitely
 transpired what had made her run out into the dark night.
 Margaret recollected the time she had seen this girl's husband,
 when he was drunk, beat his dog brutally. Then Margaret reflected
 on the gossip she never wanted to hear, yet could not avoid
 hearing, over her mother's tea-table; on the intimations and
 implications. Many things she would not otherwise have thought of
 again, but they now recurred and added their significance to her
 awakening mind. She was not keen nor analytical; she possessed
 only an ordinary intelligence; she could not trace her way
 through a labyrinth of perplexing problems; still, suffering had
 opened her eyes and she saw something terribly wrong in her
 mother's world.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Once more she stopped pacing her room, for a step in the hall
 arrested her, and made her stand quivering, as if under the lash.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I won't!" she breathed intensely. Swiftly and lightly she sped
 across her room, opened a door leading to the balcony and went
 out, closing the door behind her softly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Maynard sat before the library fire with a neglected cigar
 between his fingers. The events of the day had stirred him
 deeply. The cold shock he had felt when he touched his daughter's
 cheek in the accustomed good-night kiss remained with him, still
 chilled his lips. For an hour he sat there motionless, with his
 eyes fixed on the dying fire, and in his mind hope, doubt and
 remorse strangely mingled. Hope persuaded him that Margaret was
 only a girl, still sentimental and unpoised. Unquestionably she
 had made a good marriage. Her girlish notions about romance and
 love must give way to sane acceptance of real human life. After
 all money meant a great deal. She would come around to a sensible
 view, and get that strange look out of her eyes, that strained
 blighted look which hurt him. Then he writhed in his
 self-contempt; doubt routed all his hope, and remorse made him
 miserable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A hurried step on the stairs aroused Mr. Maynard. Swann came
 running into the library. He was white; his sharp featured face
 wore a combination of expressions; alarm, incredulity, wonder
 were all visible there, but the most striking was mortification.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Maynard, Margaret has left her room. I can't find her
 anywhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The father stared blankly at his son-in-law.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann repeated his statement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What!" All at once Mr. Maynard sank helplessly into his chair.
 In that moment certainty made him an old broken man.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's gone!" said Swann, in a shaken voice. "She has run off
 from me. I knew she would; I knew she'd do something. I've never
 been able to kiss her?only last night we quarreled about
 it. I tell you it's?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Pray do not get excited," interrupted Mr. Maynard, bracing up.
 "I'm sure you exaggerate. Tell me what you know."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I went to her room an hour, two hours ago, and knocked. She was
 there but refused me admittance. She spoke sharply?as
 if?as if she was afraid. I went and knocked again long
 after. She didn't answer. I knocked again and again. Then I tried
 her door. It was not locked. I opened it. She was not in the
 room. I waited, but she didn't come. I?I am afraid
 something is?wrong."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She might be with her mother," faltered Mr. Maynard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No, I'm sure not," asserted Swann. "Not to-night of all nights.
 Margaret has grown?somewhat cold toward her mother. Besides
 Mrs. Maynard retired hours ago."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The father and the husband stole noiselessly up the stairs and
 entered Margaret's room. The light was turned on full. The room
 was somewhat disordered; bridal finery lay littered about; a rug
 was crumpled; a wicker basket overturned. The father's instinct
 was true. His first move was to open the door leading out upon
 the balcony. In the thin snow drifted upon this porch were the
 imprints of little feet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Something gleamed pale blue in the light of the open door. Mr.
 Maynard picked it up, and with a sigh that was a groan held it
 out to Swann. It was a blue satin slipper.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Heavens!" exclaimed Swann. "She's run out in the snow?she
 might as well be barefooted."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "S-sh-h!" warned Mr. Maynard. Unhappy and excited as he was he
 did not forget Mrs. Maynard. "Let us not alarm any one."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There! See, her footsteps down the stairs," whispered Swann. "I
 can see them clear to the ground."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You stay here, Swann, so in case Mrs. Maynard or the servants
 awake you can prevent alarm. We must think of that. I'll bring
 her back."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Maynard descended the narrow stairway to the lower porch and
 went out into the yard. The storm had ceased. A few inches of
 snow had fallen and in places was deeper in drifts. The moon was
 out and shone down on a white world. It was cold and quiet. When
 Mr. Maynard had trailed the footsteps across his wide lawn and
 saw them lead out into the street toward the park, he fell
 against a tree, unable, for a moment, to command himself. Hope he
 had none left, nor a doubt. On the other side of the park, hardly
 a quarter of a mile away, was the river. Margaret had gone
 straight toward it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Outside in the middle of the street he found her other slipper.
 She had not even stockings on now; he could tell by the
 impressions of her feet in the snow. He remembered quite
 mournfully how small Margaret's feet were, how perfectly shaped.
 He hurried into the park, but was careful to obliterate every
 vestige of her trail by walking in the soft snow directly over
 her footprints. A hope that she might have fainted before she
 could carry out her determination arose in him and gave him
 strength. He kept on. Her trail led straight across the park, in
 the short cut she had learned and run over hundreds of times when
 a little girl. It was hastening her now to her death.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first her footsteps were clear-cut, distinct and wide apart.
 Soon they began to show evidences of weariness; the stride
 shortened; the imprints dragged. Here a great crushing in a snow
 drift showed where she had fallen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mr. Maynard's hope revived; he redoubled his efforts. She could
 not be far. How she dragged along! Then with a leap of his heart,
 and a sob of thankfulness he found her, with disheveled hair, and
 face white as the snow where it rested, sad and still in the
 moonlight.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XIX
 </h2>
 <p>
 Middleville was noted for its severe winters, but this year the
 zero weather held off until late in January. Lane was peculiarly
 susceptible to the cold and he found himself facing a discomfort
 he knew he could not long endure. Every day he felt more and more
 that he should go to a warm and dry climate; and yet he could not
 determine to leave Middleville. Something held him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The warmth of bright hotel lobbies and theatres and restaurants
 uptown was no longer available for Lane. His money had dwindled
 beyond the possibility of luxury, and besides he shrank now from
 meeting any one who knew him. His life was empty, dreary and
 comfortless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One wintry afternoon Lane did not wander round as long as usual,
 for the reason that his endurance was lessening. He returned
 early to his new quarters, and in the dim hallway he passed a
 slight pale girl who looked at him. She seemed familiar, but Lane
 could not place her. Evidently she had a room in the building.
 Lane hated the big barn-like house, and especially the bare cold
 room where he had to seek rest. Of late he had not eaten any
 dinner. He usually remained in bed as long as he could, and made
 a midday meal answer all requirements. Appetite, like many other
 things, was failing him. This day he sat upon his bed, in the
 abstraction of the lonely and unhappy, until the cold forced him
 to get under the covers.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His weary eyelids had just closed when he was awakened. The
 confused sense of being torn from slumber gave way to a
 perception of a voice in the room next to his. It was a man's
 voice, rough with the huskiness Lane recognized as peculiar to
 drunkards. And the reply to it seemed to be a low-toned appeal
 from a woman.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Playin' off sick, eh? You don't want to work. But you'll get me
 some money, girl, d'ye hear?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A door slammed, rattling the thin partition between the two
 rooms, and heavy footsteps dragged in the hall and on the
 stairway.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Sleep refused to come back to Lane. As he lay there he was
 surprised at the many sounds he heard. The ramshackle old
 structure, which he had supposed almost vacant, was busy with
 life. Stealthy footfalls in the hallways passed and repassed; a
 piano drummed somewhere; a man's loud voice rang out, and a
 woman's laugh faint, hollow and far away, like the ghost of
 laughter, returned in echo. The musical clinking of glasses, the
 ring of a cash register, the rattling click of pool balls, came
 up from below.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Presently Lane remembered the nature of the place. It was a house
 of night. In daylight it was silent; its inmates were asleep. But
 as the darkness unfolded a cloak over it, all the hidden springs
 of its obscure humanity began to flow. Lying there with the
 woman's appeal haunting him and all those sounds in his ears he
 thought of their meaning. The drunkard with his lust for money;
 his moaning victim; the discordant piano; the man with the vacant
 laugh; the lost hope and youth in the woman's that echoed it; the
 stealing, slipping feet of those who must tread softly?all
 conveyed to Lane that he had awakened in another world, a world
 which shunned sunlight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Toward morning he dozed off into a fitful sleep which lasted
 until ten o'clock when he arose and dressed. As he was about to
 go out a knock on the door of the room next to his recalled the
 incident of the night. He listened. Another knock followed,
 somewhat louder, but no response came from within.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, you in there," cried a voice Lane recognized as the
 landlady's. She rattled the door-knob.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A girl's voice answered weakly: "Come in."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane heard the door open.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I wants my room rent. I can't get a dollar out of your drunken
 father. Will you pay? It's four weeks overdue."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I have no money."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then get out an' leave me the room." The landlady spoke angrily.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm ill. I can't get up." The answer was faint.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane opened his door quickly, and confronted the broad person of
 the landlady.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How much does the woman owe?" he asked, quietly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah-huh!" the exclamation was trenchant with meaning. "Twenty
 dollars, if it's anything to you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'll pay it. I think I heard the woman say she was ill."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She says she is."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "May I be of any assistance?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ask her."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane glanced into the little room, a counterpart of his. But it
 was so dark he could see nothing distinctly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "May I come in? Let me raise the blind. There, the sun is fine
 this morning. Now, may I not?-"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked down at a curly head and a sweet pretty face that he
 knew.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I know you," he said, groping among past associations.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I am Rose Clymer," she whispered, and a momentary color came
 into her wan cheeks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose Clymer! Bessy Bell's friend!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, Mr. Lane. I'm not so surprised as you. I recognized you
 last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Then it was you who passed me in the hall?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well! And you're ill? What is the matter? Ah! Last
 night?it was your?your father?I heard?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," she answered. "I've not been well since?for a long
 time, and I gave out last night."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here I am talking when I might be of some use," said Lane, and
 he hurried out of the room. The landlady had discreetly retired
 to the other end of the hall. He thrust some money into her
 hands.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She seems pretty sick. Do all you can for her, be kind to her.
 I'll pay. I'm going for a doctor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He telephoned for Doctor Bronson.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 An hour later Lane, coming upstairs from his meal, met the
 physician at Rose's door. He looked strangely at Lane and shook
 his head.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, how is it I find you here in this place?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Beggars can't be choosers," answered Lane, with his old frank
 smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Humph!" exclaimed the doctor, gruffly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How about the girl?" asked Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's in bad shape," replied Bronson.... "Lane, are you aware of
 her condition?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, she's ill?that's all I know," replied Lane, slowly.
 "Rose didn't tell me what ailed her. I just found out she was
 here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson looked at Lane. "Too bad you didn't find out
 sooner. I'll call again to-day and see her.... And say, Daren,
 you look all in yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind me, Doctor. It's mighty good of you to look after
 Rose. I know you've more patients than you can take care of. Rose
 has nothing and her father's a poor devil. But I'll pay you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never mind about money," rejoined Bronson, turning to go.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane could learn little from Rose. Questions seemed to make her
 shrink, so Lane refrained from them and tried to cheer her. The
 landlady had taken a sudden liking to Lane which evinced itself
 in her change of attitude toward Rose, and she was communicative.
 She informed Lane that the girl had been there about two months;
 that her father had made her work till she dropped. Old Clymer
 had often brought men to the hotel to drink and gamble, and to
 the girl's credit she had avoided them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 For several days Doctor Bronson came twice daily to see Rose. He
 made little comment upon her condition, except to state that she
 had developed peritonitis, and he was not hopeful. Soon Rose took
 a turn for the worse. The doctor came to Lane's room and told him
 the girl would not have the strength to go through with her
 ordeal. Lane was so shocked he could not speak. Dr. Bronson's
 shoulders sagged a little, an unusual thing for him. "I'm sorry,
 Daren," he said. "I know you wanted to help the poor girl out of
 this. But too late. I can ease her pain, and that's all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Strangely shaken and frightened Lane lay down in the dark. The
 partition between his room and Rose's might as well have been
 paper for all the sound it deadened. He could have escaped that,
 but he wanted to be near her.... And he listened to Rose's moans
 in the darkness. Lane shuddered there, helpless, suffering,
 realizing. Then the foreboding silence became more dreadful than
 any sound.... It was terrible for Lane. That strange cold knot in
 his breast, that coil of panic, seemed to spring and tear,
 quivering through all his body. What had he known of torture, of
 sacrifice, of divine selflessness? He understood now how the
 loved and guarded woman went down into the Valley of the Shadow
 for the sake of a man. Likewise, he knew the infinite tragedy of
 a ruined girl who lay in agony, gripped by relentless nature.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was called into the hall by Mrs. O'Brien. She was weeping.
 Bronson met him at the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She's dying," he whispered. "You'd better come in. I've 'phoned
 to Doctor Wallace."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went in, almost blinded. The light seemed dim. Yet he saw
 Rose with a luminous glow radiating from her white face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I feel?so light," she said, with a wan smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane sat by the bed, but he could not speak. The moments dragged.
 He had a feeling of their slow but remorseless certainty.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then there were soft steps outside?Mrs. O'Brien opened the
 door?and Doctor Wallace entered the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My child," he gravely began, bending over her.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rose's big eyes with their strained questioning gaze sought his
 face and Doctor Bronson's and Lane's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Rose?are you?in pain?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The burning's gone," she said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My child," began Doctor Wallace, again. "Your pain is almost
 over. Will you not pray with me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No. I never was two-faced," replied Rose, with a weary shake of
 the tangled curls. "I won't show yellow now."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane turned away blindly. It was terrible to think of her dying
 bitter, unrepentant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh! if I could hope!" murmured Rose. "To see my mother!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then there were shuffling steps outside and voices. The door was
 opened by Mrs. O'Brien. Old Clymer crossed the threshold. He was
 sober, haggard, grieved. He had been told. No one spoke as he
 approached Rose's bedside.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lass?lass?" he began, brokenly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then he sought from the men confirmation of a fear borne by a
 glance into Rose's white still face. And silence answered him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Lass, if you're goin'?tell me?who was to blame?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No one?but myself?father," she replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Tell me, who was to blame?" demanded Clymer, harshly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Her pale lips curled a little bitterly, and suddenly, as a change
 seemed to come over her, they set that way. She looked up at Lane
 with a different light in her eyes. Then she turned her face to
 the wall.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane left the room, to pace up and down the hall outside. His
 thoughts seemed deadlocked. By and bye, Doctor Bronson came out
 with Doctor Wallace, who was evidently leaving.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is unconscious and dying," said Doctor Bronson to Lane, and
 then bade the minister good-bye and returned to the room.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How strangely bitter she was!" exclaimed Doctor Wallace to Lane.
 "Yet she seemed such a frank honest girl. Her attitude was an
 acknowledgment of sin. But she did not believe it herself. She
 seemed to have a terrible resentment. Not against one man, or
 many persons, but perhaps life itself! She was beyond me. A
 modern girl?a pagan! But such a brave, loyal, generous
 little soul. What a pity! I find my religion at fault because it
 can accomplish nothing these days."
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XX
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane took Rose's death to heart as if she had been his sister or
 sweetheart. The exhaustion and exposure he was subjected to
 during these days dragged him farther down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One bitter February day he took refuge in the railroad station.
 The old negro porter who had known Lane since he was a boy
 evidently read the truth of Lane's condition, for he contrived to
 lead him back into a corner of the irregular room. It was an
 obscure corner, rather hidden by a supporting pillar and the
 projecting end of a news counter. This seat was directly over the
 furnace in the cellar. Several pipes, too hot to touch, came up
 through the floor. It was the warmest place Lane had found, and
 he sat there for hours. He could see the people passing to and
 fro through the station, arriving and leaving on trains, without
 himself being seen. That afternoon was good for him, and he went
 back next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But before he could get to the coveted seat he was accosted by
 Blair Maynard. Lane winced under Blair's piercing gaze; and the
 haggard face of his friend renewed Lane's deadened pangs. Lane
 led Blair to the warm corner, and they sat down. It had been many
 weeks since they had seen each other. Blair talked in one
 uninterrupted flow for an hour, and so the life of the people
 Lane had given up was once again open to him. It was like the
 scoring of an old wound. Then Lane told what little there was to
 tell about himself. And the things he omitted Blair divined.
 After that they sat silent for a while.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Of course you knew Mel's boy died," said Blair, presently.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh?No!" exclaimed Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hadn't you heard? I thought?of course you?.... Yes,
 he died some time ago. Croup or flu, I forget."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dead!" whispered Lane, and he leaned forward to cover his face
 with his hands. He had seemed so numb to feeling. But now a storm
 shook him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dare, it's better for him?and Mel too," said Blair, with a
 hand going to his friend's shoulder. "That idea never occurred to
 me until day before yesterday when I ran into Mel. She
 looked?Oh, I can't tell you how. But I got that strange
 impression."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did?did she ask about me?" queried Lane, hoarsely, as he
 uncovered his face, and sat back.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She certainly did," replied Blair, warmly. "And I lied like a
 trooper. I didn't know where you were or how you were, but I
 pretended you were O.K."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And then?" asked Lane, breathlessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She said, 'Tell Daren I must see him.' I promised and set out to
 find you. I was pretty lucky to run into you.... And now, old
 sport, let me get personal, will you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Go as far as you like," replied Lane, in muffled voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, I think Mel loves you," went on Blair, in hurried
 softness. "I always thought so?even when we were kids. And
 now I know it.... And Lord! Dare you just ought to see her now.
 She's lovely. And she's your wife."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What if she is?both lovely?and my wife?" queried
 Lane, bitterly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If I were you I'd go to her. I'd sure let her take care of
 me.... Dare, the way you're living is horrible. I have a home,
 such as it is. My room is warm and clean, and I can stay in it.
 But you?Dare, it hurts me to see you?as you
 are??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" interrupted Lane, passionately. The temptation Blair
 suggested was not to be borne.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane met Blair the next afternoon at the station, and again on
 the next. That established a habit in which both found much
 comfort and some happiness. Thereafter they met every day at the
 same hour. Often for long they sat silent, each occupied with his
 own thoughts. Occasionally Blair would bring a package which
 contained food he had ransacked from the larder at home. Together
 they would fall upon it like two schoolboys. But what Lane was
 most grateful for was just Blair's presence.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was distressing then, after these meetings had extended over a
 period of two weeks, to be confronted one afternoon by a new
 station agent who called Blair and Lane bums and ordered them out
 of the place.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Blair raised his crutch to knock the man down. But Lane
 intercepted it, and got his friend out of the station. It was
 late afternoon with the sun going down over the hill across the
 railroad yards. Blair stood a moment bare-headed, with the light
 on his handsome haggard face. How frail he seemed?too frail
 of body for the magnificent spirit so flashing in his eyes, so
 scathing on his bitter lips. Lane bade him good-bye and turned
 away, with a strange intimation that this was the last time he
 would ever see Blair alive.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Wretched and desperate, Lane bought drink and took it to his room
 with him. On that dark winter night he sat by the window of his
 room. Insensible now to the cold, to the wind moaning outside, to
 the snow whirling against the pane, he lived with phantoms. To
 and fro, to and fro glided the wraith-forms, vanishing and
 appearing. The soft rustling sound of the snow was the rustle of
 their movements. Across the gleam of light, streaking coldly
 through the pane, flickering fitfully on the wall, floated
 shadows and faces.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He did not know when he succumbed to drowsy weakness. But he
 awoke at daylight, lying on the floor, stiff with cold. Drink
 helped him to drag through that day. Then something happened to
 him, and time meant nothing. Night and day were the same. He did
 not eat. When he lay back upon his bed he became irrational, yet
 seemed to be conscious of it. When he sat up his senses slowly
 righted. But he preferred the spells of aberration. Sometimes he
 was possessed by hideous nightmares, out of which he awoke with
 the terror of a child. Then he would have to sit up in the dark,
 in a cold sweat, and wait, and wait, until he dared to lie back
 again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the daytime delusions grew upon him. One was that he was
 always hearing the strange voices of the river, and another that
 he was being pursued by an old woman clad in a flowing black
 mantle, with a hood on her head and a crooked staff in her hand.
 The voices and apparition came to him, now in his waking hours;
 they came suddenly without any prelude or warning. He explained
 them as odd fancies resulting from strong drink; they grew on him
 until his harsh laugh could not shake them off. He managed
 occasionally to drag himself out of the house. In the streets he
 felt this old black hag following him; but later she came to him
 in the lonely silence of his room. He never noticed her unless he
 glanced behind him, and he was powerless to resist that impulse.
 At length the dreary old woman, who seemed to grow more gaunt and
 ghostly every day, took the form in Lane's disordered fancy of
 the misfortune that war had put upon him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane dreamed once that it was a gray winter afternoon; dark
 lowering clouds hung over the drab-colored hills, and a chill
 north wind scurried over the bare meadows, sending the dead
 leaves rustling over the heath and moaning through the leafless
 oaks. What a sad day it was, he thought, as he faced the biting
 wind: sad as was his life and a fitting one for the deed on which
 he had determined! Long since he had left the city and was on the
 country road. He ascended a steep hill. From its highest point he
 looked back toward the city he was leaving forever. Faint it lay
 in the distance, only a few of its white spires shining out dimly
 from the purple haze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What was that dark shadow? Far down the winding road he discerned
 an object moving slowly up the hill. Closer he looked, and
 trembled. An old woman with flowing black robes was laboriously
 climbing the hill. Whirling, he placed his hand on his breast,
 firmly grasped something there, and then strode onward. Soon he
 glanced over his shoulder. Yes, there she came, hobbling over the
 crest, her bent form and long crooked staff clearly silhouetted
 against the gray background. She raised the long staff and
 pointed it at him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Now it seemed the day was waning; deep shadows lay in the
 valleys, and night already enveloped the forest. Through rents in
 the broken clouds a few pale stars twinkled fitfully. Soon dark
 cloud curtains scurried across these spaces shutting out the
 light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He plunged into the forest. His footsteps made no sound on the
 soft moss as he glided through wooded aisles and under giant
 trees. Once well into the deep woods, he turned to look behind
 him. He saw a shadow, blacker than the forest-gloom, stealthily
 slipping from tree to tree. He looked no more. For hours he
 traveled on and on, never stopping, never looking backward, never
 listening, intent only on placing a great distance between him
 and his pursuer.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He came upon a swamp where his feet sank in the soft earth, and
 through all the night, with tireless strength and fateful
 resolve, he toiled into this dreamy waste of woods and waters,
 until at length a huge black rock loomed up in his way. He
 ascended to its summit and looked beyond.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It seemed now that he had reached his destination. Wood spirits
 and phantoms of night would mourn over him, but they would keep
 his secret. He peered across a shining lake, and tried to pierce
 the gloom. No living thing moved before his vision. Silver
 rippling waves shimmered under that starlit sky; tall weird pines
 waved gently in the night breeze; slender cedars, resembling
 spectres, reared their heads toward the blue-black vault of
 heaven. He listened intently. There was a faint rustling of the
 few leaves left upon the oaks. The strange voices that had always
 haunted him, the murmuring of river waters, or whispering of
 maidens, or muttering of women were now clear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly two white forms came gliding across the waters. The face
 of one was that of a young girl. Golden hair clustered round the
 face and over the fair brow. The lips smiled with mournful
 sweetness. The other form seemed instinct with life. The face was
 that of a living, breathing girl, soulful, passionate, her arms
 outstretched, her eyes shining with a strange hopeful light.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Down, down, down he fell and sank through chill depths, falling
 slowly, falling softly. The cool waters passed; he floated
 through misty, shadowy space. An infinitude of silence enclosed
 him. Then a dim and sullen roar of waters came to his ears, borne
 faintly, then stronger, on a breeze that was not of earth.
 Anguish and despair tinged that sodden wind. Weird and terrible
 came a cry. Steaming, boiling, burning, rumbling chaos?a
 fearful rushing sullen water! Then a flash of light like a
 falling star sped out of the dark clouds.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane found himself sitting up in bed, wet and shaking. The room
 was dark. Some one was pounding on the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Lane, are you there?" called a man's deep voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. What's wanted?" answered Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The door opened wide, impelled by a powerful arm. Light from the
 hallway streamed in over the burly form of a man in a heavy coat.
 He stood in the doorway evidently trying to see.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sick in bed, hey?" he queried, with gruff kind voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I guess I am. Who're you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm Joshua Iden and I've come to pack you out of here," he said.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No!" protested Lane, faintly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Your wife is downstairs in a taxi waiting," went on his strange
 visitor.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "My wife!" whispered Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes. Mel Iden, my daughter. You've forgotten maybe, but she
 hasn't. She learned to-day from Doctor Bronson how ill you were.
 And so she's come to take you home."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel Iden! The name seemed a part of the past. This was only
 another dream, thought Lane, and slowly fell back upon his bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, aren't you able to sit up?" queried this visitor Lane took
 for the spectre of a dream. He advanced into the room. He grasped
 Lane with firm hand. And then Lane realized this was no
 nightmare. He began to shake.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sit up?" he echoed, vaguely. "Sure I can.... You're Mel's
 father?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes," replied the other. "Come, get out of this.... Well, you
 haven't much dressing to do. And that's good.... Steady there."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As he rose, Lane would have fallen but for a quick move of
 Iden's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Only shoes and coat," said Lane, fumbling around. "They're
 somewhere."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Here you are.... Let me help.... There. Have you an overcoat?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "No," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, there's a robe in the taxi. Come on now. I'll come back
 and pack your belongings."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He put an arm under Lane's and led him out into the hall and down
 the dim stairway to the street. Under the yellow light Lane saw a
 cab, toward which Iden urged him. Lane knew that he moved, but he
 seemed not to have any feeling in his legs. The cabman put a hand
 back to open the door.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, here he is," called out Iden, cheerfully.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane felt himself being pushed into the cab. His knees failed and
 he sank forward, even as he saw Mel's face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren!" she cried, and caught him.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then all went black.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXI
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane's return to consciousness was an awakening into what seemed
 as unreal and unbelievable as any of his morbid dreams.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But he knew that his mind was clear. It did not take him a moment
 to realize from the feel of his body and the fact that he could
 not lift his hand that he had been prostrate a long time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The room he lay in was strange to him. It had a neatness and
 cleanliness that spoke of a woman's care. It had two small
 windows, one of which was open. Sunshine flooded in, and the
 twitter of swallows and hum of bees filled the air outside. Lane
 could scarcely believe his senses. A warm fragrance floated in.
 Spring! What struck Lane then most singularly was the fact of the
 silence. There were no city sounds. This was not the Iden home.
 Presently he heard soft footfalls downstairs, and a low voice, as
 of some one humming a tune. What then had happened?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As if in answer to his query there came from below a sound of
 heavy footfalls on a porch, the opening and closing of a door, a
 man's cheery voice, and then steps on the stairs. The door opened
 and Doctor Bronson entered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hello, Doc," said Lane, in a very faint voice.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you son of a gun!" ejaculated the doctor, in delight. Then
 he called down the stairs. "Mel, come up here quick."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then came a low cry and a flying patter of light feet. Mel ran
 past the doctor into the room. To Lane she seemed to have grown
 along with the enchantments his old memories had invoked. With
 parted lips, eager-eyed, she flashed a look from Lane to Doctor
 Bronson and back again. Then she fell upon her knees by the bed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Do you know me?" she asked, her voice tremulous.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Sure. You're the wife?of a poor sick soldier?Daren
 Lane."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Doctor, he has come to," cried Mel, in rapture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fine. I've been expecting it every day," said Doctor Bronson,
 rubbing his hands. "Now, Daren, you can listen all you want. But
 don't try to talk. You've really been improving ever since we got
 you out here to the country. For a while I was worried about your
 mind. Lately, though, you showed signs of rationality. And now
 all's O.K. In a few days we'll have you sitting up."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Doctor Bronson's prophecy was more than fulfilled. From the hour
 of Lane's return to consciousness, he made rapid improvement.
 Most of the time he slept and, upon awakening, he seemed to feel
 stronger. Lane had been ill often during the last eighteen
 months, but after this illness there was a difference, inasmuch
 as he began to make surprising strides toward recovery. Doctor
 Bronson was nonplussed, and elated. Mel seemed mute in her
 gratitude. Lane could have told them the reason for his
 improvement, but it was a secret he hid in his heart.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In less than a week he was up, walking round his little room,
 peering out of the windows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel had told Lane the circumstances attending his illness. It had
 been late in February when she and her father had called for him
 at his lodgings. He had collapsed in the cab. They took him to
 the Iden home where he was severely ill during March. In April he
 began to improve, although he did not come to his senses. One day
 Mr. Iden brought Jacob Lane, an uncle of Lane's, to see him.
 Lane's uncle had been at odds with the family for many years.
 There had been a time when he had cared much for his nephew
 Daren. The visit had evidently revived the old man's affection,
 for the result was that Jacob Lane offered Daren the use of a
 cottage and several acres of land on Sycamore River, just out of
 town. Joshua Iden had seen to the overhauling of the cottage; and
 as soon as the weather got warm, Doctor Bronson had consented to
 Lane's removal to the country. And in a few days after his
 arrival at the cottage, Lane recovered consciousness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, this beats me," said Lane, for the hundredth time. "Uncle
 Jake letting us have this farm. I thought he hated us all."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, it was your going to war?and coming back?that
 you were ill and fell to so sad a plight. I think if your uncle
 had known, he'd have helped you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I couldn't ask anybody for help," said Lane. "Don't you
 understand that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You were a stubborn fellow," mused Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me? Never. I'm the meekest of mortals.... Mel, I know every rock
 along the river here. This is just above where at flood time the
 Sycamore cuts across that rocky flat below, and makes a bad
 rapid. There's a creek above and a big woods. I used to fish and
 hunt there a good deal."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Two weeks passed by and Daren felt himself slowly but surely
 getting stronger. Every morning when he came down to breakfast he
 felt a little better, had a little more color in his pale cheeks.
 At first he could not eat, but as the days went by he regained an
 appetite which, to Mel's delight, manifestly grew stronger. No
 woman could have been brighter and merrier. She laughed at the
 expression on his face when he saw her hands red from hot
 dish-water, and she would not allow him to help her. The boast
 she had made to him of her housekeeping abilities had not been an
 idle one. She prepared the meals and kept the cottage tidy, and
 went about other duties in a manner that showed she was
 thoroughly conversant with them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The way in which she had absolutely put aside the past, her witty
 sallies and her innocent humor, her habit of singing while at
 work, the depth of her earnest conversation; in all, the sweet
 wholesome strength and beauty of her nature had a remarkable
 effect on Lane. He began to live again. It was simply impossible
 to be morbid in her presence. While he was with her he escaped
 from himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The day came when he felt strong enough to take a walk. He
 labored up the hillside toward a wood. Thereafter he went every
 day and walked farther every time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With his returning strength there crept into his mind the dawning
 of a hope that he might get well. At first he denied it, denied
 even the conviction that he wished to live. But not long. The
 hope grew, and soon he found himself deliberately trying to build
 up his health. Every day he put a greater test upon himself, and
 as summer drew on he felt his strength gradually increasing.
 Against Doctor Bronson's advice, he got an axe and set to work on
 the wood pile, very cautiously at first.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Every day he wielded the axe until from sheer exhaustion he could
 not lift it. Then he would sit on a log and pant and scorn his
 weakness. What a poor man it was who could not chop wood for ten
 minutes without getting out of breath! This pile of logs became
 to him a serious and meaning obstacle. Every morning he went at
 it doggedly. His back grew lame, his arms sore, his hands raw and
 blistered. But he did not give up.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel seemed happy to see him so occupied, and was loath to call
 him even when it was necessary. After lunch it was his habit to
 walk in the woods. Unmindful of weather, every day he climbed the
 hill, plunged into the woods, and tramped until late in the
 afternoon. Returning, he usually slept until Mel called him to
 dinner. Afterward they spent the evening in the little library.
 The past seemed buried. Lane's curiosity as to family and friends
 had not reawakened.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel possessed a rich contralto voice which had been carefully
 cultivated. Every evening in the twilight, with only the
 flickering of the wood fire in the room, she would sit at the
 piano and sing. Lane would close his eyes and let the mellow
 voice charm his every sense. It called up his highest feelings;
 it lingered in his soul, thrilled along his heart and played on
 the chords of love and hope. It dispelled the heavy gloom that so
 often pressed down upon him; it vanquished the depression that
 was the forerunner of his old terrible black mood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It came about that Lane spent most of his time outdoors, in the
 fields, along the river, on the wooded hills. The morbid brooding
 lost its hold on his mind, and in its place came memories,
 dreams, imaginations. He walked those hills with phantoms of the
 past and phantoms of his fancy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The birds sang, the leaves fluttered, the wind rustled through
 the branches. White clouds sailed across the blue sky, a crow
 cawed from a hilltop, a hawk screeched from above, the roar of
 the river rapids came faintly upward. And Lane saw eyes gazing
 dreamily downward, thoughtful at a word, looking into life,
 trying to pierce the veil. It was all so beautiful?so
 terrible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The peeping of frogs roused in Lane sensations thrilling and
 strange. The quick sharp notes were suggestive of cool nights, of
 flooded streams and marshy places. How often Lane wandered in the
 dusk along the shore to listen to this chorus!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At that hour twilight stole down; the dark hills rose to the pale
 blue sky; there was a fair star and a wisp of purple cloud; and
 the shadowy waters gleamed. Breaking into the trill of the frogs
 came the song of a lonely whippoorwill.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane felt a better spirit resurging. He felt the silence, the
 beauty, the mystery, the eternal that was there. All that was
 small and frail was passing from him. There came a regurgitation
 of physical strength?a change of blood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The following morning while Lane was laboring over his wood pile,
 he thought he heard voices in the front yard, and presently Mel
 came around the walk accompanied by Doctor Wallace and Doctor
 Bronson.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Lane, glad to see you," said Doctor Bronson, in his hearty
 tones. "Doctor Wallace and I are on our way to the Grange and
 thought we'd stop off a minute."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How are you, Mr. Lane? I see you're taking work seriously," put
 in Doctor Wallace, in his kindly way.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, I'm coming round all right," replied Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stood there with his shirt sleeves rolled up, his face bronzed
 a little and now warm and moist from the exercise, with something
 proven about him, with a suggestion of a new force which made him
 different.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was an unmistakable kindliness in the regard of both men
 and a scarcely veiled fear Lane was quick to read. Both men were
 afraid they would not find him as they had hoped to.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, you've chosen a charming location for a home," observed
 Doctor Wallace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Mel was showing her old teacher and friend the garden and
 flowerbeds the practical Doctor Bronson asked Lane: "Did you chop
 all that wood?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The doctor pointed to three long piles of wood, composed of short
 pieces regularly stacked one upon another.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I did."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How long did it take you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I've been weeks at it. That's a long time, but you know, Doctor,
 I was in pretty poor condition. I had to go slow."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, you've done wonders. I want to tell you that. I hardly
 knew you. You're still thin, but you're gaining. I won't say now
 what I think. Be careful of sudden or violent exertion. That's
 all. You've done more than doctors can do."
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXII
 </h2>
 <p>
 "Mel, come here," called Lane from the back porch, "who the deuce
 are those people coming down the hill?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel shaded her eyes from the glare of the bright morning sun.
 "The lady is Miss Hill, my old schoolteacher. I'd know her as far
 as I could see her. Look how she carries her left arm. This is
 Saturday, for she has neither a lunch basket nor a prayer book in
 that outstretched hand. If you see Miss Hill without either you
 can be certain it's Saturday. As to the gentleman?Daren,
 can it possibly be Colonel Pepper?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That's the Colonel, sure as you're alive," declared Lane, with
 alacrity. "They must be coming here. Where else could they be
 making for? But Mel, for them to be together! Why, the Colonel's
 an old sport, and she?Mel?you know Miss Hill!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Whereupon Mel acquainted Daren with the circumstances of a
 romance between Miss Hill and the gallant Colonel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well?of all things!" gasped Lane, and straightway became
 speechless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're right, Daren; they are coming in. Isn't that nice of
 them? Now, don't you dare show I told you anything. Miss Hill is
 so easily embarrassed. She's the most sensitive woman I ever
 knew."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane recovered in time to go through the cottage to the front
 porch and to hear Miss Hill greet Mel affectionately, and
 announce with the tone of a society woman that she had
 encountered Colonel Pepper on the way and had brought him along.
 Lane had met the little schoolteacher, but did not remember her
 as she appeared now, for she was no longer plain, and there was
 life and color in her face. And as for embarrassment, not a trace
 of it was evident in her bearing. According to Mel, the mere
 sight of man, much less of one of such repute as Colonel Pepper,
 would once have been sufficient to reduce Miss Hill to a
 trembling shadow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But the Colonel! None of his courage manifested an appearance
 now. To Lane's hearty welcome he mumbled some incoherent reply
 and mopped his moist red face. He was wonderfully and gorgeously
 arrayed in a new suit of light check, patent leather shoes, a tie
 almost as bright as his complexion, and he had a carnation in his
 buttonhole. This last proof of the Colonel's mental condition was
 such an overwhelming shock to Lane that all he could do for a
 moment was stare. The Colonel saw the stare and it rendered him
 helpless.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Miss Hill came to the rescue with pleasant chat and most
 interesting news to the exiles. She had intended coming out to
 the cottage for ever so long, but the weather and one thing or
 another falling on a Saturday, had prevented until to-day. How
 pretty the little home! Did not the Colonel agree with her that
 it was so sweet, so cosy, and picturesquely situated? Did they
 have chickens? What pleasure to have chickens, and flowers, too!
 Of course they had heard about Mr. Harry White and the widow,
 about the dissension in Doctor Wallace's church. And Margaret
 Maynard was far from well, and Helen Wrapp had gone back home to
 her mother, and Bessy Bell had grown into a tall ravishingly
 beautiful girl and had distracted her mother by refusing a
 millionaire, and seemed very much in love with young Dalrymple.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And I've the worst class of girls I ever had," went on Miss
 Hill. "The one I had last year was a class of angels compared to
 what I have now. I reproved one girl whose mother wrote me that
 as long as Middleville had preachers like Doctor Wallace and
 teachers like myself there wasn't much chance of a girl being
 good. So I'm going to give up teaching."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The little schoolmistress straightened up in her chair and looked
 severe. Colonel Pepper shifted uneasily, bent his glance for the
 hundredth time on his shiny shoes and once more had recourse to
 his huge handkerchief and heated brow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Colonel, it seems good to see you once more," put in Lane.
 "Tell me about yourself. How do you pass the time?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Same old story, Daren, same old way, a game of billiards now and
 then, and a little game of cards. But I'm more lonely than I used
 to be."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Why, you never were lonely!" exclaimed Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, yes indeed I was, always," protested the Colonel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "A little game of cards," mused Lane. "How well I remember! You
 used to have some pretty big games, too."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Er?yes?you see?once in a while, very seldom,
 just for fun," he replied.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How about your old weakness? Hope you've conquered that," went
 on Lane, mercilessly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The Colonel was thrown into utter confusion. And when Miss Hill
 turned terrible eyes upon him, poor Pepper looked as if he wanted
 to sink through the porch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane took pity on him and carried him off to the garden and the
 river bank, where he became himself again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 They talked for a while, but neither mentioned the subject that
 had once drawn them together. For both of them a different life
 had begun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A little while afterward Mel and Lane watched the bright figure
 and the slight dark one go up the hillside cityward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What do you know about that!" ejaculated Lane for the tenth
 time.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Hush!" said Mel, and she touched his lips with a soft exquisite
 gesture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At three o'clock one June afternoon Mel and Daren were lounging
 on a mossy bank that lined the shady side of a clear
 rapid-running brook. A canoe was pulled up on the grass below
 them. With an expression of utter content, Lane was leaning over
 the brook absorbed in the contemplation of a piece of thread
 which was tied to a crooked stick he held in his hand. He had
 gone back to his boyhood days. Just then the greatest happiness
 on earth was the outwitting of bright-sided minnows and golden
 flecked sunfish. Mel sat nearby with her lap full of flowers
 which she had gathered in the long grass and was now arranging.
 She was dressed in blue; a sunbonnet slipped back from her head;
 her glossy hair waved in the breeze. She looked as fresh as a
 violet.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, Daren, we have spent four delightful, happy hours. How
 time flies! But it's growing late and we must go," said Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Wait a minute or two," replied Lane. "I'll catch this fellow.
 See him bite! He's cunning. He's taken my bait time and again,
 but I'll get him. There! See him run with the line. It's a big
 sunfish!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "How do you know? You haven't seen him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can tell by the way he bites. Ha! I've got him now," cried
 Lane, giving a quick jerk. There was a splash and he pulled out a
 squirming eel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ugh! The nasty thing!" cried Mel, jumping up. Lane had flung the
 eel back on the bank and it just missed falling into Mel's lap.
 She screamed, and then when safely out of the way she laughed at
 the disgust in his face.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "So it was a big sunfish? My! What a disillusion! So much for a
 man's boastful knowledge."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, if it isn't a slimy old eel. There! be off with you; go
 back into the water," said Lane, as he shook the eel free from
 the hook.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Come, we must be starting."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pushed the canoe into the brook, helped Mel to a seat in the
 bow and shoved off. In some places the stream was only a few feet
 wide, but there was enough room and water for the light craft and
 it went skimming along. The brook turned through the woods and
 twisted through the meadows, sometimes lying cool and dark in the
 shade and again shining in the sunlight. Often Lane would have to
 duck his head to get under the alders and willows. Here in an
 overshadowed bend of the stream a heron rose lumbering from his
 weedy retreat and winged his slow flight away out of sight; a
 water wagtail, that cunning sentinel of the brooks, gave a
 startled <i>tweet! tweet!</i> and went flitting like a gray
 streak of light round the bend.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, please don't be so energetic," said Mel, nervously.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm strong as a horse now. I'm?hello! What's that?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I didn't hear anything."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I imagined I heard a laugh or shout."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The stream was widening now as it neared its mouth. Lane was
 sending the canoe along swiftly with vigorous strokes. It passed
 under a water-gate, round a quick turn in the stream, where a
 bridge spanned it, and before Lane had a suspicion of anything
 unusual he was right upon a merry picnic party. There were young
 men and girls resting on the banks and several sitting on the
 bridge. Automobiles were parked back on the bank.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane swore under his breath. He recognized Margaret, Dick Swann
 and several other old-time acquaintances and friends of Mel's.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Who is it?" asked Mel. Her back was turned. She did not look
 round, though she heard voices.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It doesn't matter," said Lane, calmly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He would have given the world to spare Mel the ordeal before her,
 but that was impossible. He put more power into his stroke and
 the canoe shot ahead.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It passed under the bridge, not twenty feet from Margaret Swann.
 There was a strange, eager, wondering look in Margaret's clear
 eyes as she recognized Mel. Then she seemed to be swallowed up by
 the green willows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "That was damned annoying," muttered Lane to himself. He could
 have met them all face to face without being affected, but he
 realized how painful this meeting must be to Mel. These were
 Mel's old friends. He had caught Margaret's glance. Old memories
 came surging back. His gaze returned to Mel. Her face was grave
 and sad; her eyes had darkened, and there was a shadow in them.
 His glance sought the green-lined channel ahead. The canoe cut
 the placid water, turned the last bend, and glided into the swift
 river. Soon Lane saw the little cottage shining white in the
 light of the setting sun.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 One afternoon, as Lane was returning from the woods, he met a car
 coming out of the grassy road that led down to his cottage. As he
 was about to step aside, a gay voice hailed him. He waited. The
 car came on. It contained Holt Dalrymple and Bessy Bell.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Say, don't you dodge us," called Holt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren Lane!" screamed Bessy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then the car halted, and with two strides Lane found himself face
 to face with the young friends he had not seen for months. Holt
 appeared a man now. And Bessy?no longer with bobbed
 hair?older, taller, changed incalculably, struck him as
 having fulfilled her girlish promise of character and beauty.
 "Well, it's good to see you youngsters", said Lane, as he shook
 hands with them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Holt seemed trying to hide emotion. But Bessy, after that first
 scream, sat staring at Lane with a growing comprehending light in
 her purple eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly she burst out. "Daren?you're <i>well!</i>.... Oh,
 how glad I am! Holt, just look at him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I'm looking, Bess. And if he's really Daren Lane, I'll eat him,"
 responded Holt.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This is all I needed to make to-day the happiest day of my
 life," said Bessy, with serious sweetness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "This? Do you mean meeting me? I'm greatly flattered, Bessy,"
 said Lane, with a smile.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then both a blush and a glow made her radiant.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I'm sixteen to-day. Holt and I are?we're engaged I
 told mother, and expected a row. She was really pleased.... And
 then seeing you well again. Why, Daren, you've actually got
 color. Then Holt has been given a splendid business
 opportunity.... And?Oh! it's all too good to be true."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Well, of all things!" cried Lane, when he had a chance to speak.
 "You two engaged! I?I could never tell you how glad I am."
 Lane felt that he could have hugged them both. "I congratulate
 you with all my heart. Now Holt?Bessy, make a go of it.
 You're the luckiest kids in the world."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, we've both had our fling and we've both been hurt," said
 Bessy, seriously. "And you bet <i>we</i> know how lucky we
 are?and what we owe Daren Lane for our happiness to-day."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Bessy, that means a great deal to me," replied Lane, earnestly.
 "I know you'll be happy. You have everything to live for. Just be
 true to yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So the moment of feeling passed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "We went down to your place," said Holt, "and stayed a while
 waiting for you."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I think Mel is lovely. May I not come often to see you
 both?" added Bessy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You know how pleased we'll be.... Bessy, do you ever see my
 sister Lorna?" asked Lane, hesitantly.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I see her now and then. Only the other day I met her in a
 store. Daren, she's getting some sense. She has a better position
 now. And she said she was not going with any fellow but Harry."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "And my mother?" Lane went on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "She is quite well, Lorna said. And they are getting along well
 now. Lorna hinted that a relative?an uncle, I think, was
 helping them."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was silent a moment, too stirred to trust his voice.
 Presently he said: "Bessy, your birthday has brought happiness to
 some one besides yourself."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He bade them good-bye and strode on down the hill toward the
 cottage. How strangely meetings changed the future! Holt's pride
 of possession in Bessy brought poignantly back to Lane his own
 hidden love for Mel. And Bessy's rapture of amaze at his
 improvement in health put Lane face to face with a possibility he
 had dreamed of but had never believed in?that he might
 live.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 That night was for Lane a sleepless one. He seemed to have
 traveled in a dreamy circle, and was now returning to memories
 and pangs from which he had long been free.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next morning, without any hint to Mel of his intentions, he left
 the cottage and made his way into town. Almost he felt as he had
 upon his return from France. He dropped in to see his mother and
 was happy to find her condition of mind and health improved. She
 was overjoyed to see Lane. Her surprise was pitiful. She told him
 she was sure that he had recovered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was this matter of his physical condition that had brought
 Lane into Middleville. For many months he had resigned himself to
 death. And now he could not deny even his morbid fancy that he
 felt stronger than at any time since he left France. He had
 worked hard to try to get well, but he had never, in his heart,
 believed that possible.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane called upon Doctor Bronson and asked to be thoroughly
 examined. The doctor manifestly found the examination a task of
 mounting gratification. At length he concluded.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren, I told you over a year ago I didn't know of anything that
 could save your life," he said. "I didn't. But something
 <i>has</i> saved your life. You are thirty pounds heavier and
 gaining fast. That hole in your back is healed. Your lungs are
 nearly normal. You have only to be careful of a very violent
 physical strain. That weak place in your back seems gone....
 You're going to <i>live</i>, my boy.... There has been some magic
 at work. I'm very happy about it. How little doctors know!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Dazed and stunned by this intelligence, Lane left the doctor's
 residence and turned through town on his way homeward. As he
 plodded on, he began to realize the marvelous truth. What would
 Blair say? He hurried to a telephone exchange to acquaint his
 friend with the strange thing that had happened. But Blair had
 been taken to a sanitarium in the mountains. Lane hurried out of
 town into the country, down the river road, to the cottage, there
 to burst in upon Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren!" she cried, in alarm. "What's happened?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 She rose unsteadily, her eyes dilating.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Doctor Bronson said?I was?well," panted Lane.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh!... Daren, is <i>that</i> it?" she replied, with a wonderful
 light coming to her face. "I've known that for weeks."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "After all?I'm not going?to die!... My God!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane rushed out and strode along the river, and followed the
 creek into the woods. Once hidden in the leafy recesses he
 abandoned himself to a frenzy of rapture. What he had given up
 had come back to him. Life! And he lay on his back with his
 senses magnified to an intense degree.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The day was late in June, and a rich, thick amber light floated
 through the glades of the forest. Majestic white clouds sailed in
 the deep blue sky. The sun shone hot down into the glades. Under
 the pines and maples there was a cool sweet shade. Wild flowers
 bloomed. A fragrance of the woods came on the gentle breeze. The
 leaves rustled. The melancholy song of a hermit thrush pierced
 the stillness. A crow cawed from a high oak. The murmur of
 shallow water running over rocks came faintly to Lane's ears.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane surrendered utterly to the sheer primitive exultation of
 life. The supreme ecstasy of that hour could never have been
 experienced but for the long hopeless months which had preceded
 it. For a long time he lay there in a transport of the senses,
 without thinking. As soon as thought regained dominance over his
 feelings there came a subtle change in his reaction to this
 situation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had forgotten much. He had lived in a dream. He had
 unconsciously grown well. He had been strangely, unbelievably
 happy. Why? Mel Iden had nursed him, loved him, inspired him back
 to health. Her very presence near him, even unseen, had been a
 profound happiness. He made the astonishing discovery that for
 months he had thought of little else besides his wife. He had
 lived a lonely life, in his room, and in the open, but all of it
 had been dominated by his dreams and fancies and emotions about
 her. He had roused from his last illness with the past apparently
 dead. There was no future. So he lived in the moment, the hour.
 While he lay awake in the silence of night, or toiled over his
 wood pile, or wandered by the brook under the trees, his dreamy
 thoughts centered about her. And now the truth burst upon him.
 His love for her had been stronger than his ruined health and
 blasted life, stronger than misfortune, stronger than death. It
 had made him well. He had not now to face death, but life. And
 the revelation brought on shuddering dread.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane lingered in the woods until late afternoon. Then he felt
 forced to return to the cottage. The look of the whole world
 seemed changed. All was actual, vivid, striking. Mel's loveliness
 burst upon him as new and strange and terrible as the fact of his
 recovery. He had hidden his secret from her. He had been like a
 brother, kind, thoughtful, gay at times, always helpful. But he
 had remained aloof. He had basked in the sunshine of her
 presence, dreamily reveling in the consciousness of what she was
 to him. That hour had passed forever.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He saw her now as his wife, a girl still, one who had been
 cruelly wronged by life, who had turned her back upon the past
 and who lived for him alone. She had beauty and brains, a
 wonderful voice, and personality that might have fitted her for
 any career or station in life. She thought only of him. She had
 found content in ministering to him. She was noble and good.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the light of these truths coming to him, Lane took stock of
 his love for Mel. It had come to be too mighty a thing to
 understand in a moment. He lived with it in the darkness of
 midnight and in the loneliness of the hills. He had never loved
 Helen. Always he had loved Mel Iden?all his life. Clear as
 a crystal he saw the truth. The war with its ruin for both of
 them had only augmented the powers to love. Lane's year of agony
 in Middleville had been the mere cradling of a mounting and
 passionate love. He must face it now, no longer in dreamy lulled
 unconsciousness, but in all its insidious and complex meaning.
 The spiritual side of it had not changed. This girl with the
 bloom of woman's loveliness upon her, with her grace and
 sweetness and fire, with the love that comes only once in life,
 belonged to him, was his wife. She did not try to hide anything.
 She was unconscious of appeal. Her wistfulness came from her
 lonely soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The longer Lane dwelt on this matter of his love for Mel the
 deeper he found it, the more inexplicable and alluring. And when
 at last it stood out appallingly, master of him, so beautiful and
 strange and bitter, he realized that between him and Mel was an
 insurmountable and indestructible barrier.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then came storm and strife of soul. Night and day the conflict
 went on. Outwardly he did not show much sign of his trouble,
 though he often caught Mel's dark eyes upon him, sadly
 conjecturing. He worked in the garden; he fished the creek, and
 rowed miles on the river; he wandered in the woods. And the only
 change that seemed to rise out of his tumult was increasing love
 for this girl with whom his fate had been linked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So once more Lane became a sufferer, burdened by pangs, a
 wanderer along the naked and lonely shore of grief. His passion
 and his ideal were at odds. Unless he changed his nature, his
 reverence for womanhood, he could never realize the happiness
 that might become his. All that he had sacrificed had indeed been
 in vain. But he had been true to himself. His pity for Mel was
 supreme. It was only by the most desperate self-control that he
 could resist taking her in his arms, confessing his love,
 swearing with lying lips he had forgotten the wrong done her and
 asking her to face the future as his loving wife. The thought was
 maddening. It needed no pity for Mel to strengthen it. He needed
 love. He needed to fulfill his life.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 But Lane did not yield, though he knew that if he continued to
 live with Mel, in time the sweetness and enchantment of her would
 be too great for him. This he confessed.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 More and more he had to fight his jealousy and the treacherous
 imagination that would create for him scenes of torment. He
 cursed himself as base and ignoble. Yet the truth was always
 there. If Mel had only loved the father of her child?if she
 had only loved blindly and passionately as a woman?it would
 have been different. But her sacrifice had not been one of love.
 It had been one of war. It had the nobility of woman's sacrifice
 to the race. But as an individual she had perished.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIII
 </h2>
 <p>
 Summer waned. The long hot days dragged by. The fading rushes
 along the river drooped wearily over their dry beds. The
 yellowing leaves of the trees hung dejected; they were mute
 petitioners for cool breezes and rain. The grasshoppers chirped
 monotonously, the locusts screeched shrilly, both being products
 of the long hot summer, and survivors of the heat, inclined to
 voice their exultation far into the fall season.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 September yielded them full sway, and burned away day by day,
 week by week, dusty and scorching, without even a promise of
 rain. October, however, dawned, misty and dark; the clouds crept
 up reluctantly at first and then, as if to make amends for
 neglect, trooped black and threatening toward the zenith. Storm
 followed storm, and at evening, after the violent crashing
 thunder and vivid lightning and driving torrents of rain had
 ceased, a soft, steady downpour persisted all night and all the
 next day.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The drought was broken. A rainy fall season was prophesied. The
 old danger of the river rising in flood was feared.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After the sear and lifeless color of the fields and forests, what
 a welcome relief to Daren Lane were the freshened green, the
 dawning red, the tinging gold! The forest on the hill was soft
 and warm, and but for the gleams of autumn, would have showed
 some of the tenderness of spring. Down in the lowlands a sea of
 color waved under a blue, smoky, melancholy haze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane climbed high that Sunday afternoon and penetrated deep into
 the woods.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was rest here. The forest was rich, warm with the scent of
 pine, of arbor vitae. There was the haunting promise of more
 brilliant hues. Thoughts swept through Lane's mind. The great
 striving world was out of sight. Here in the gold-flecked shade,
 under the murmuring pines and pattering poplars, there was a
 world full of joy, wise in its teaching, significant of the glory
 that was fading but which would come again.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane loved the low hills, the deep, colorful woods in autumn.
 There he lost himself. He learned. Silence and solitude taught
 him. From there he had vision of the horde of men righting down
 the false impossible trails of the world. He felt the sweetness,
 the frailty, the dependence, the glory and the doom of women
 battling with life. He realized the hopeless traits of human
 nature. Like dead scales his egotism dropped from him. He divined
 the weaving of chances, the unknown and unnamed, the pondering
 fates in store. The dominance of pain over all?the wraith
 of the past?the importunity of a future never to be
 gained?the insistence of nature, ever-pressing closer its
 ruthless claims?all these which became intelligible to
 Lane, could not keep life from looming sweet, hopeful, wonderful,
 worthy man's best fight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 And sometimes the old haunting voices whispered to him out of the
 river shadows?deeper, different, strangely more
 unintelligible than ever before, calling more to his soul.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Next morning Lane got up at the usual hour and went outdoors, but
 returned almost immediately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The river is rising fast. Listen. Hear that roar. There's a
 regular old Niagara just below."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I imagined that roar was the wind."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "The water has come up three feet since daylight. I guess I'll go
 down now and pull in some driftwood."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Oh, Daren! Don't be so adventurous. When the river is high
 there's a dangerous rapid below."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You're right about that. But I won't take any risks. I can
 easily manage the boat, and I'll be careful."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The following three days it rained incessantly. Outside, on the
 gravel walks, there was a ceaseless drip, drip, drip.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Friday evening the rain ceased, the murky clouds cleared away and
 for a few moments a rainbow mingled its changing hues with the
 ruddy glow of the setting sun. The next day dawned bright and
 dear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane was indeed grateful for a change. Mel had been unaccountably
 depressed during those gloomy days. And it worried him that this
 morning she did not appear her usual self.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, are you well?" he asked.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I am perfectly well," she replied. "I couldn't sleep much
 last night on account of that roar."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Don't wonder. This flood will be the greatest ever known in
 Middleville."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, and that makes more suffering for the poor."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "There are already many homeless. It's fortunate our cottage is
 situated on this high bank. Just look! I declare, jostling logs
 and whirling drifts! There's a pen of some kind with an object
 upon it."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's a pig. Oh! poor piggy!" said Mel, compassionately.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A hundred yards out in the rushing yellow current a small house
 or shed drifted swiftly down stream. Upon it stood a pig. The
 animal seemed to be stolidly contemplating the turbid flood as if
 unaware of its danger.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Here the river was half a mile wide, and full of trees, stumps,
 fences, bridges, sheds?all kinds of drifts. Just below the
 cottage the river narrowed between two rocky cliffs and roared
 madly over reefs and rocks which at a low stage of water
 furnished a playground for children. But now that space was
 terrible to look upon and the dull roar, with a hollow boom at
 intervals, was dreadful to hear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren?I?I've kept something from you," said Mel,
 nervously. "I should have told you yesterday."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "What?" interrupted Lane, sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It's this. It's about poor Blair.... He?he's dead!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane stared at her white face as if it were that of a ghost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Blair! You should have told me. I must go to see him."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It was not a long ride from the terminus of the car line to where
 the Maynards lived, yet measured by Lane's growing distress of
 mind it seemed a never-ending journey.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He breathed a deep breath of relief when he got off the car, and
 when the Maynard homestead loomed up dark and silent, he hung
 back slightly. A maid admitted Lane, and informed him that Mr.
 Maynard was ill and Mrs. Maynard would not see any one. Margaret
 was not at home. The maid led Lane across the hall into the
 drawing-room and left him alone.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the middle of the room stood a long black cloth-covered box.
 Lane stepped forward. Upon the dark background, in striking
 contrast, lay a white, stern face, marble-like in its stone-cold
 rigidity. Blair, his comrade!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The moment Lane saw the face, his strange fear and old gloomy
 bitterness returned. Something shot through him which trembled in
 his soul. To him the story of Blair's sacrifice was there to read
 in his quiet face, and with it was an expression he had never
 seen, a faint wonder of relief, which suggested peace.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 How strange to look upon Blair and find him no longer responsive!
 Something splendid, loyal, generous, loving had passed away. Gone
 was the vital spark that had quickened and glowed to noble
 thoughts; gone was the strength that had been weakness; gone the
 quick, nervous, high-strung spirit; gone the love that had no
 recompense. The drawn face told of physical suffering. Hard Blair
 had found the world, bitter the reward of the soldier, wretched
 the unholy worship of money and luxury, vain and hollow mockery
 the home of his boyhood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane went down the path and out of the gate. He had faint
 perceptions of the dark trees along the road. He came to a little
 pine grove. It was very quiet. There was a hum of insects, and
 the familiar, sad, ever-present swishing of the wind through the
 trees. He listened to its soft moan, and it eased the intensity
 of his feelings. This emotion was new to him. Death, however, had
 touched him more than once. Well he remembered his stunned
 faculties, the unintelligible mystery, the awe and the grief
 consequent on the death of his first soldier comrade in France.
 But this was different; it was a strange disturbance of his
 heart. Oppression began to weight him down, and a nameless fear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He had to cross the river on his way home to the cottage. In the
 middle of the bridge he halted to watch the sliding flood go over
 the dam, to see the yellow turgid threshing of waves below. The
 mystic voices that had always assailed his ears were now roaring.
 They had a message for him. It was death. Had he not just looked
 upon the tragic face of his comrade? Out over the tumbling waters
 Lane's strained gaze swept, up and down, to and fro, while the
 agony in his heart reached its height. The tumult of the flood
 resembled his soul. He spent an hour there, then turned slowly
 homeward.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He stopped at the cottage gate. It was now almost dark. The
 evening star, lonely and radiant, peeped over the black hill.
 With some strange working at his heart, with some strange
 presence felt, Lane gazed at the brilliant star. How often had he
 watched it! Out there in the gloom somewhere, perhaps near at
 hand, had lurked the grim enemy waiting for Blair, that now might
 be waiting for him. He trembled. The old morbidness knocked at
 his heart. He shivered again and fought against something
 intangible. The old conviction thrust itself upon him. He had
 been marked by fate, life, war, death! He knew it; he had only
 forgotten.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Daren! Daren!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel's voice broke the spell. Lane made a savage gesture, as if he
 were in the act of striking. Thought of Mel recalled the
 stingingly sweet and bitter fact of his love, and of life that
 called so imperiously.
 </p><br>
 <hr>
 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXIV
 </h2>
 <p>
 "If Amanda would only marry me!" sighed Colonel A Pepper, as he
 stacked the few dishes on the cupboard shelf and surveyed his
 untidy little kitchen with disparaging eyes.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The once-contented Colonel was being consumed by two great
 fires?remorse and love. For more years than he could
 remember he had been a victim of a deplorable habit. Then two
 soft eyes shone into his life, and in their light he saw things
 differently, and he tried to redeem himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Even good fortune, in the shape of some half-forgotten meadow
 property suddenly becoming valuable, had not revived his once
 genial spirits. Remorse was with him because Miss Hill refused to
 marry him till he overcame the habit which had earned him
 undesirable fame.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 So day by day poor Colonel Pepper grew sicker of his lonely
 rooms, his lonely life, and of himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "If Amanda only would," he murmured for the thousandth time, and
 taking his hat he went out. The sunshine was bright, but did not
 give him the old pleasure. He walked and walked, taking no
 interest in anything. Presently he found himself on the outskirts
 of Middleville within sound of the muffled roar of the flooded
 river, and he wandered in its direction. At sight of the old
 wooden bridge he remembered he had read that it was expected to
 give way to the pressure of the rushing water. On the levee,
 which protected the low-lying country above the city, were crowds
 of people watching the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ye've no rivers loike thot in Garminy," observed a half-drunken
 Irishman. He and several more of his kind evidently were teasing
 a little German.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Pepper had not stood there long before he heard a number
 of witticisms from these red-faced men.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 After the manner of his kind the German had stolidly swallowed
 the remarks about his big head, and its shock of stubby hair, and
 his checked buff trousers; but at reference to his native country
 his little blue eyes snapped, and he made a remark that this
 river was extremely like one in Germany.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At this the characteristic contrary spirit of the Irishman burst
 forth.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Dutchy, I'd loike ye to know ye're exaggeratin'," he said.
 "Garminy ain't big enough for a river the loike o' this. An' I'll
 leave it to me intilligint-lookin' fri'nd here."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Pepper, thus appealed to, blushed, looked embarrassed,
 coughed, and then replied that he thought Germany was quite large
 enough for such a river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Did ye study gographie?" questioned the Irishman with fine
 scorn.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Pepper retired within himself.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The unsteady and excitable fellow had been crowded to the rear by
 his comrades, who evidently wished to lessen, in some degree, the
 possibilities of a fight.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Phwat's in thim rivers ye're spoutin' about?" asked one.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Vater, ov course."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Me wooden-shoed fri'nd, ye mane beer?beer."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You insolt me, you red-headed??"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Was that Dutchman addressin' of me?" demanded the half-drunken
 Irishman, trying to push by his friends.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "It'd be a foiner river if it wasn't yaller," said a peacemaker,
 holding his comrade.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the slight scuffle which ensued one of the men unintentionally
 jostled the German. His pipe fell to the ground. He bent to
 recover it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Through Colonel Pepper's whole being shot the lightning of his
 strange impulse, a tingling tremor ran over him; a thousand
 giants lifted and swung his arm. He fought to check it, but in
 vain. With his blood bursting, with his strength expending itself
 in one irresistible effort, with his soul expanding in fiendish,
 unholy glee he brought his powerful hand down upon the bending
 German.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 There was a great shout of laughter.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The German fell forward at length and knocked a man off the levee
 wall. Then the laughter changed to excited shouts.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The wall was steep but not perfectly perpendicular. Several men
 made frantic grabs at the sliding figure; they failed, however,
 to catch it. Then the man turned over and rolled into the river
 with a great splash. Cries of horror followed his disappearance
 in the muddy water, and when, an instant later, his head bobbed
 up yells filled the air.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 No one had time to help him. He tried ineffectually to reach the
 levee; then the current whirled him away. The crowd caught a
 glimpse of a white despairing face, which rose on the crest of a
 muddy wave, and then was lost.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In the excitement of the moment the Colonel hurried from the
 spot. Horror possessed him; he felt no less than a murderer.
 Again he walked and walked. Retribution had overtaken him. The
 accursed habit that had disgraced him for twenty years had
 wrought its punishment. Plunged into despair he plodded along the
 streets, till at length, out of his stupefaction, came the
 question?what would Amanda say?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 With that an overwhelming truth awakened him. He was free. He
 might have killed a man, but he certainly had killed his habit.
 He felt the thing dead within him. Wildly he gazed around to see
 where he was, and thought it a deed of fate that he had
 unconsciously traveled toward the home of his love. For there
 before his eyes was Amanda's cottage with the red geranium in her
 window. He ran to the window and tapped mysteriously and peered
 within. Then he ran to the door and knocked. It opened with a
 vigorous swing.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mr. Pepper, what do you mean?tapping on my window in such
 clandestine manner, and in broad daylight, too?" demanded Miss
 Hill with a stern voice none of her scholars had ever heard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Amanda, dear, I am a murderer!" cried Pepper, in tones of
 unmistakable joy. "I am a murderer, but I'll never do <i>it</i>
 again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Laws!" exclaimed Miss Hill
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He pushed her aside and closed the door, and got possession of
 her hands, all the time pouring out incoherent speech, in which
 only <i>it</i> was distinguishable.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Man alive! Are you crazy?" asked Miss Hill, getting away from
 him into a corner. But it happened to be a corner with a couch,
 and when her trembling legs touched it she sat down.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Never, never again will I do it!" cried the Colonel, with a
 grand gesture.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Can you talk sense?" faltered the schoolmistress.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Colonel Pepper flung himself down beside her, and with many
 breathless stops and repetitions and eloquent glances and
 applications of his bandana to his heated face, he finally got
 his tragic story told.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Is that all?" inquired Miss Hill, with a touch of sarcasm. "Why,
 you're not a murderer, even if the man drowns, which isn't at all
 likely. You've only fallen again."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fallen. But I never fell so terribly. This was the worst."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Stuff! Where's the chivalry you tried to make me think you were
 full of? Didn't you humiliate me, a poor helpless woman? Wasn't
 that worse? Didn't you humiliate me before a crowd of people in a
 candy-store? Could anything be more monstrous? You did <i>it</i>,
 you remember?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Amanda! Never! Never!" gasped the Colonel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You did, and I let you think I believed your lies."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Amanda! I'll never do it again, never to any one, so long as I
 live. It's dead, same as the card tricks. Forgive me, Amanda, and
 marry me. I'm so fond of you, and I'm so lonely, and those meadow
 lots of mine, they'll make me rich. Amanda, would you marry me?
 Would you love an old duffer like me? Would you like a nice
 little home, and an occasional silk dress, and no more teaching,
 and some one to love you?always? Would you, Amanda, would
 you?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Yes, I would," replied Amanda.
 </p><br>

 <h2>
 CHAPTER XXV
 </h2>
 <p>
 Lane was returning from a restless wandering in the woods. As he
 neared the flooded river he thought he heard a shout for help. He
 hurried down to the bank, and looked around him, but saw no
 living thing. Then he was brought up sharply by a cry, the
 unmistakable scream of a human being in distress. It seemed to
 come from behind a boathouse. Running as far round the building
 as the water would permit he peered up and down the river in both
 directions.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At first he saw only the half-submerged float, the sunken hull of
 a launch, the fast-running river, and across the wide expanse of
 muddy water the outline of the levee. Suddenly he spied out in
 the river a piece of driftwood to which a man was clinging.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Help! Help!" came faintly over the water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane glanced quickly about him. Several boats were pulled up on
 the shore, one of which evidently had been used by a boatman
 collecting driftwood that morning, for it contained oars and a
 long pike-pole. The boat was long, wide of beam, and flat of
 bottom, with a sharp bow and a blunt stern, a craft such as
 experienced rivermen used for heavy work. Without a moment's
 hesitation Lane shoved it into the water and sprang aboard.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Meanwhile, short though the time had been, the log with its human
 freight had disappeared beyond the open space in the willows.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Although Lane pulled a powerful stroke, when he got out of the
 slack water into the current, so swift was it that the boat
 sheered abruptly and went down stream with a sweep. Marking the
 piece of driftwood and aided by the swiftly running stream Lane
 soon overhauled it.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The log which the man appeared to be clutching was a square piece
 of timber, probably a beam of a bridge, for it was long and full
 of spikes. When near enough Lane saw that the fellow was not
 holding on but was helpless and fast on the spikes. His head and
 arms were above water.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane steered the boat alongside and shouted to the man. As he
 made no outcry or movement, Lane, after shipping the oars,
 reached over and grasped his collar. Steadying himself, so as not
 to overturn the boat, Lane pulled him half-way over the gunwale,
 and then with a second effort, he dragged him into the boat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The man evidently had fainted after his last outcry. His body
 slipped off the seat and flopped to the bottom of the boat where
 it lay with the white face fully exposed to the glare of the sun.
 A broad scar, now doubly sinister in the pallid face, disfigured
 the brow.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane recoiled from the well-remembered features of Richard Swann.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "God Almighty!" he cried. And his caustic laughter rolled out
 over the whirling waters. The boat, now disengaged from the
 driftwood, floated swiftly down the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane stared in bewilderment at Swann's pale features. His
 amazement at being brought so strangely face to face with this
 man made him deaf to the increasing roar of the waters and blind
 to the greater momentum of the boat.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A heavy thump, a grating sound and splintering of wood, followed
 by a lurch of the boat and a splashing of cold water in his face
 brought Lane back to a realization of the situation.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He looked up from the white face of the unconscious man. The boat
 had turned round. He saw a huge stone that poked its ugly nose
 above the water. He turned his face down stream. A sea of
 irregular waves, twisting currents, dark, dangerous rocks and
 patches of swirling foam met his gaze.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Lane stood up, with a boatman's instinct, to see the water
 far ahead, the spectacle thrilled him. A yellow flood, in
 changeful yet consistent action, rolled and whirled down the wide
 incline between the stony banks, and lost itself a mile below in
 a smoky veil of mist. Visions of past scenes whipped in and out
 his mind, and he saw an ocean careening and frothing under a
 golden moon; a tide sweeping down, curdled with sand, a grim
 stream of silt, rushing on with the sullen sweep of doom and the
 wildfire of the prairie, leaping, cavorting, reaching out,
 turning and shooting, irresistibly borne under the lash of the
 wind. He saw in the current a live thing freeing itself in
 terror.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A roar, like the blending of a thousand storms among the pines,
 filled his ears and muffled his sense of hearing and appalled
 him. He sat down with his cheeks blanching, his skin tightening,
 his heart sinking, for in that roar he heard death. Escape was
 impossible. The end he had always expected was now at hand. But
 he was not to meet it alone. The man who had ruined his sister
 and so many others must go to render his accounting, and in this
 justice of fate Lane felt a wretched gratification.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The boat glanced with a hard grind on a rock and shot down a long
 yellow incline; a great curling wave whirled back on Lane; a
 heavy shock sent him flying from his seat; a gurgling demoniacal
 roar deafened his ears and a cold eager flood engulfed him. He
 was drawn under, as the whirlpool sucks a feather; he was tossed
 up, as the wind throws a straw. The boat bobbed upright near him.
 He grasped the gunwale and held on.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 It bounced on the buffeting waves and rode the long swells like a
 cork; it careened on the brink of falls and glided over them; it
 thumped on hidden stones and floating logs; it sped by
 black-nosed rocks; it drifted through fogs of yellow mist; it ran
 on piles of driftwood; it trembled with the shock of beating
 waves and twisted with the swirling current.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Still Lane held on with a vise-like clutch.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he seemed to feel some mighty propelling force under
 him; he rose high with the stern of the boat. Then the bow
 pitched down into a yawning hole. A long instant he and the boat
 slid down a glancing fall?then thunderous
 roar?furious contending wrestle?cold, yellow, flying
 spray?icy, immersing, enveloping blackness!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 A giant tore his hands from the boat. He whirled round and round
 as he sank. A languid softness stole over him. He saw the smile
 of his mother, the schoolmate of his boyhood, the old attic where
 he played on rainy days, and the spotted cows in the pasture and
 the running brook. He saw himself a tall young man, favorite of
 all, winning his way in life that was bright.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then terrible blows of his heart hammered at his ribs, throbs of
 mighty pain burst his brain; great constrictions of his throat
 choked him. He began fighting the encompassing waters with
 frenzied strength. Up and up he fought his way to see at last the
 light, to gasp at the air. But the flood sucked at him, a weight
 pulled at his feet. As he went down again something hard struck
 him. With the last instinctive desperate love of life in his
 action he flung out his hand and grasped the saving thing. It was
 the boat. He hooked his elbow over the gunwale. Then darkness
 filmed over his eyes and he seemed to feel himself whirling round
 and round, round and round. A long time, seemingly, he whirled,
 while the darkness before his eyes gave way to smoky light, his
 dead ears awoke to confused blur of sound. But the weight on his
 numb legs did not lessen.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 All at once the boat grated on a rock, and his knees struck. He
 lay there holding on while life and sense seemed to return.
 Something black and awful retreated. Then the rush and roar of
 the rapids was again about him. He saw that he had drifted into a
 back eddy behind the ledge of rock, and had whirled slowly round
 and round with a miscellaneous collection of driftwood.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane steadied himself on the slippery ledge and got to his feet.
 The boat was half full of water, out of which Swarm's ghastly
 face protruded. By dint of great effort Lane pulled it sideways
 on the ledge, and turned most of the water out.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Swann lay limp and sodden. But for his eyes he would have
 appeared dead, and they shone with a conscious light of terror,
 of passionate appeal and hope, the look with which a man prayed
 for his life. Presently his lips moved imperceptibly. "Save me!
 for God's sake, save me!"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Shuddering emotion that had the shock of electricity shook Lane.
 In his ears again rang the sullen, hollow, reverberating boom of
 the flood. Here was the man who had done most to harm him,
 begging to be saved. Swann, poor wretch, was afraid to die; he
 feared the unknown; he had a terror of that seething turmoil of
 waters; he could not face the end of that cold ride. Why?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Fool!" Lane cried, glaring wildly about him. Was it another
 dream? Unreality swayed him again. He heard the roar, he saw the
 splitting white-crested waves, the clouds of yellow vapor. He
 beat his numb legs and shook himself like a savage dog. Then he
 made a discovery?in some way he could not account for, the
 oars had remained in the boat. They had been loose in their
 oar-locks.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Questions formed in Lane's mind, questions that seemed put by a
 dawning significance. Why had he heard the cry for help? Why had
 he found the boat? Why had the drowning man proved to be one of
 two men on earth he hated, one of the two men whom he wanted to
 kill? Why had he drifted into the rapids? Why had he come safely
 through a vortex of death? Why had Swann's lips formed that
 prayer? Why had the oars remained in the boat?
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Far below over the choppy sea of waves he saw a bridge. It was
 his old familiar resting place. Through the white enveloping glow
 he seemed to see himself standing on that bridge. Then came to
 him a strange revelation. Yesterday he had stood on that bridge,
 after seeing Blair for the last time. He had stood there while he
 lived through an hour of the keenest anguish that had come to
 him; and in that agony he had watched the plunging river. He had
 watched it with eyes that could never forget. His mind,
 exquisitely alive, with the sensibility of a plexus of racked and
 broken nerves, had taken up every line, every channel and stone
 and rapid of that flood, and had engraved them in ineffaceable
 characters. With the unintelligible vagary of thought, while his
 breast seemed crushed, his heart broken, he had imagined himself
 adrift on that surging river, and he had planned his escape
 through the rapids.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 As Lane stood on the ledge, knee-deep in the water, with the
 certainty that he had a perfect photograph of the field of
 tumbling waters below in his mind's eye, a strange voice seemed
 to whisper in his ear.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 <i>"This is your great trial!"</i>
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Without further hesitation he shoved the boat off the ledge.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Round and round the back eddy he floated. At the outlet on the
 down-stream side, where the gleaming line of foam marked the
 escape of water into the on-rushing current, he whirled his boat,
 stern ahead. Down he shot with a plunge and then up with a rise.
 Racing on over the uneven swells he felt the hissing spray, and
 the malignant tips of the waves that broke their fury on the boat
 and expended it in a shower of stinging drops. The wind cut his
 face. He rode a sea of foam, then turgid rolling mounds of water
 that heaved him up and up, and down long planes that laughed with
 hollow boom, then into channels of smooth current, where the
 torrent wreathed the black stones in yellowish white.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane saw the golden sun, the blue sky, the fleecy clouds, the red
 and purple of the colored hills; and felt his chest expand with
 the mounting glory of great effort. The muscles of his back and
 arms, strengthened by the long toil with his heavy axe, rippled
 and swelled and burned, and stretched like rubber cords, and
 strung tight like steel bands. The boat was a toy.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 He rodes the waves, and threaded a labyrinth of ugly stones, and
 shot an unobstructed channel, and evaded a menacing drift. The
 current carried him irresistibly onward. When his keen eye caught
 danger ahead he sunk the oars deep and pulled back. A powerful
 stroke made the boat pause, another turned her bow to the right
 or left, then the swift water hitting her obliquely sheered her
 in the safe direction. So Lane kept afloat through the spray that
 smelled fresh and dank, through the crash and surge and roar and
 boom, through the boiling caldron.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 The descent quickened. On! On! he was borne with increasing
 velocity. The yellow demons rose in fury. Boo?oom!
 Boo?oom! The old river god voiced his remorseless roar. The
 shrill screaming shriek of splitting water on sharp stones cut
 into the boom. On! On! Into the yellow mist that might have been
 smoke from hell streaked the boat, out upon a curving billow,
 then down! down! upon an upheaving curl of frothy water. The
 river, like a huge yellow mound, hurled its mass at Lane. All was
 fog and steam and whistling spray and rumble.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 At length the boat swept out into the open with a long plunge
 over the last bit of roughened water. Here the current set in a
 curve to the left, running off the rocky embankment into the
 natural channel of the river. The dam was now only a couple of
 hundred yards distant. The water was smooth and the drift had
 settled to a slow, ponderous, sliding movement.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane pulled powerfully against the current and toward the
 right-hand shore. That was closest. Besides, he remembered a long
 sluice at the end of the dam where the water ran down as on a
 mill-race. If he could row into that!
 </p><br>
 <p>
 In front of Lane, extending some distance, was a broad unbroken
 expanse of water leading to the dam. A tremendous roar issued
 from that fall. The muddy spray and mist rose high. To drift over
 there would be fatal. Logs and pieces of debris were kept rolling
 there for hours before some vagary of current caught them and
 released them.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane calculated the distance with cunning eye. He had been an
 expert boatman all his boyhood days. By the expenditure of his
 last bit of reserve strength he could make the sluice. And he
 redoubled his efforts to such an extent that the boat scarcely
 went down stream at all, yet edged closer to the right hand
 shore. Lane saw a crowd of people on the bridge below the dam.
 They were waving encouragement. He saw men run down the steep
 river bank below the mill; and he knew they were going to be
 ready to assist him if he were fortunate enough to ride down the
 sluice into the shallow backwater on that side.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Rowing now with the most powerful of strokes, Lane kept the bow
 of the boat upstream and a little to the right. Thus he gained
 more toward the shore. But he must time the moment when it would
 be necessary to turn sharply.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "I can?make?it," muttered Lane. He felt no
 excitement. The thing had been given him to do. His strokes were
 swift, but there was no hurry.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Suddenly he felt a strange catching of breath in his lungs. He
 coughed. Blood, warm and salt, welled up from his throat. Then
 his bitter, strangled cry went out over the waters. At last he
 understood the voices of the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Lane quickened his strokes. He swung the bow in. He pointed it
 shoreward. Straight for the opening of the sluice! His last
 strokes were prodigious. The boat swung the right way and shot
 into the channel. Lane dropped his oars. He saw men below wading
 knee-deep in the water. The boat rode the incline, down to the
 long swell and curled yellow billows below, where it was checked
 with violent shock. Lane felt himself propelled as if into
 darkness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 When Lane opened his eyes he recognized as through a veil the
 little parlor of the Idens. All about him seemed dim and far
 away. Faces and voices were there, indistinguishable. A dark
 cloud settled over his eyes. He dreamed but could not understand
 the dreams. The black veil came and went.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 What was the meaning of the numbness of his body? The immense
 weight upon his breast! Then it seemed he saw better, though he
 could not move. Sunlight streamed in at the window. Outside were
 maple leaves, gold and red and purple, swaying gently. Then a
 great roaring sound seemed to engulf him. The rapids? The voice
 of the river.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Then Mel was there kneeling beside him. All save her face grew
 vague.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Swann?" he whispered.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "You saved his life," said Mel.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Ah!" And straightway he forgot.
 "Mel?what's?wrong?with me?"
 </p><br>
 <p>
 Mel's face was like white marble and her hands on his trembled
 violently. She could not answer. But he knew. There seemed to be
 a growing shadow in the room. Her eyes held a terrible darkness.
 </p><br>
 <p>
 "Mel, I?never told?you," he whispered. "I married
 you?because I loved you.... But I was?jealous.... I
 hated.... I couldn't forgive. I couldn't understand.... Now I
 know. There's a law no woman?can transgress. Soul and love
 are the same?in a woman. They must be inviolable.... If I
 could have lived?I'd have surrendered to you. For I loved
 you?beyond words to tell. It was love that made me well....
 But we could not have been happy. Never, with that spectre
 between us.... And, so?it must be?always.... In spite
 of war?and wealth?in spite of men?women must
 rise...."
 </p><br>
 <p>
 His voice failed, and again the strange rush and roar enveloped
 him. But it seemed internal, dimmer and farther away. Mel's face
 was fading. She spoke. And her words were sweet, without meaning.
 Then the fading grayness merged into night.
 </p><br>

 <br>
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">wickedness until Seth
 Craddock's malevolence directed</span>
 <br>
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">itself against him. He did not
 emerge from the</span>
 <br>
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">maelstrom until he had
 obliterated every vestige of</span>

 himself of the safety of a</span>
 <br>
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">certain dark-eyed girl.</span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
 you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is
 owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments
 must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License. You must require such a user to return or
 destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
